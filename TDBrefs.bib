The reovirus serotypes 1/Lang and 3/Dearing differed in their capacity to kill embryos in vitro and in vivo: when embryos were infected in vitro with reovirus serotype 1/Lang and then transferred to foster mothers, pups resulted only at multiplicities of infection of a few particles per embryo. In contrast, infection of embryos with as much as 6 X 10(4) reovirus type 3 particles per embryo resulted in viable pups. In vitro, reovirus serotype 1/Lang was more virulent than serotype 3/Dearing. The infection of ovum with reovirus offers a unique model for the study of congenital infection and should yield important information concerning the molecular basis of virus virulence to maturing fetuses.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a paucity of literature on the epidemiology of severe acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). We describe a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) population-based study to determine the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of children with ADEM requiring PICU admission or resulting in death. Anonymized data from the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet) were obtained for all children under 16 years with a diagnosis of ADEM admitted to 25 PICUs in England and Wales (2004-2008). The Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality database was also searched. In total, 27 PICANet cases (13 females:14 males; median age 4.8 years) were ascertained and all were alive on discharge. In addition, three cases were identified from the ONS mortality database. Of the 27 PICANet cases, clinical features included; seizures (n = 5); upper airway respiratory obstruction/stridor (n = 2); unspecified encephalopathy (n = 27); and polyfocal neurological deficits (n = 6). The median duration of ventilation was 3 days. Inotropic support was required in 4/27 patients, and one patient had invasive intracranial pressure monitoring. None received plasmapheresis. We conclude that the incidence of childhood ADEM admitted to the PICU in England and Wales is approximated at 0.5 per million children/year, thus representing approximately one quarter of children admitted with ADEM (denominator: 2009 Canadian surveillance data).},

  Abstract                 = {Nonaccidental trauma has become a leading cause of death in infants and toddlers. Compared with children suffering from accidental trauma, many children with nonaccidental trauma present with injuries requiring neurosurgical management and operative interventions.A retrospective review was performed concerning the clinical and radiological findings, need for neurosurgical intervention, and outcomes in infants and toddlers with head injuries who presented to Albany Medical Center between 1999 and 2007. The Fisher exact probability test and ORs were computed for Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, hyperdense versus hypodense subdural collections, and discharge and follow-up King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI) scores.There were 218 patients, among whom 164 had sustained accidental trauma, and 54 had sustained nonaccidental trauma (NAT). The patients with accidental traumatic injuries were more likely to present with GCS scores of 13-15 (OR 6.95), and the patients with NATs with of GCS scores 9-12 (OR 6.83) and 3-8 (OR 2.99). Skull fractures were present in 57.2\% of accidentally injured patients at presentation, and 15\% had subdural collections. Skull fractures were present in 30\% of nonaccidentally injured patients, and subdural collections in 52\%. Patients with evidence of hypodense subdural collections were significantly more likely to be in the NAT group (OR 20.56). Patients with NAT injuries were also much more likely to require neurosurgical operative intervention. Patients with accidental trauma were more likely to have a KOSCHI score of 5 at discharge and follow-up (ORs 6.48 and 4.58), while patients with NAT had KOSCHI scores of 3a, 3b, 4a, and 4b at discharge (ORs 6.48, 5.47, 2.44, and 3.62, respectively), and 3b and 4a at follow-up.Infant and toddler victims of NAT have significantly worse injuries and outcomes than those whose trauma was accidental. In the authors' experience, however, with aggressive intervention, many of these patients can make significant neurological improvements at subsequent follow-up visits.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether moderate hypothermia (HYPO) (32-33 degrees C) begun in the early period after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and maintained for 48 hours is safe compared with normothermia (NORM) (36.5-37.5 degrees C). METHODS: After severe (Glasgow Coma Scale score < or =8) nonpenetrating TBI, 48 children less than 13 years of age admitted within 6 hours of injury were randomized after stratification by age to moderate HYPO (32-33 degrees C) treatment in conjunction with standardized head injury management versus NORM in a multicenter trial. An additional 27 patients were entered into a parallel single-institution trial of excluded patients because of late transfer or consent (delayed in transfer >6 h but within 24 h of admission), unknown time of injury (e.g., child abuse), and adolescence (e.g., aged 13-18 yr). Assessments of safety included mortality, infection, coagulopathy, arrhythmias, and hemorrhage as well as ability to maintain target temperature, mean intracranial pressure (ICP), and percent time of ICP less than 20 mm Hg during the cooling and subsequent rewarming phases. Additionally, assessments of neurocognitive outcomes were obtained at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Moderate HYPO after severe TBI in children was found to be safe relative to standard management and NORM in children of all ages and in children with delay of initiation of treatment up to 24 hours. Although there was decreased mortality in HYPO in both studies, there was an increased potential for arrhythmias with HYPO, although they were manageable with fluid administration or rewarming. Additionally, there was a reduction in mean ICP during the first 72 hours after injury in both studies, although rebound ICP elevations in HYPO compared with those in NORM were noted for up to 10 to 12 hours after rewarming. Although functional outcome at 3 or 6 months did not differ between treatment groups, functional outcome tended to improve from the 3- to 6-month cognitive assessment in HYPO compared with NORM, although the sample size was too small for any definitive conclusions. CONCLUSION: HYPO is likely a safe therapeutic intervention for children after severe TBI up to 24 hours after injury. Further studies are necessary and warranted to determine its effect on functional outcome and intracranial hypertension.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: On the basis of mixed results from previous trials, we assessed whether therapeutic hypothermia for 48-72 h with slow rewarming improved mortality in children after brain injury. METHODS: In this phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomised controlled trial, we included patients with severe traumatic brain injury who were younger than 18 years and could be enrolled within 6 h of injury. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence to randomly allocate patients (1:1; stratified by site and age [<6 years, 6-15 years, 16-17 years]) to either hypothermia (rapidly cooled to 32-33 degrees C for 48-72 h, then rewarmed by 0.5-1.0 degrees C every 12-24 h) or normothermia (maintained at 36.5-37.5 degrees C). The primary outcome was mortality at 3 months, assessed by intention-to-treat analysis; secondary outcomes were global function at 3 months after injury using the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) and the GOS-extended pediatrics, and the occurrence of serious adverse events. Investigators assessing outcomes were masked to treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00222742. FINDINGS: The study was terminated early for futility after an interim data analysis on data for 77 patients (enrolled between Nov 1, 2007, and Feb 28, 2011): 39 in the hypothermia group and 38 in the normothermia group. We detected no between-group difference in mortality 3 months after injury (6 [15%] of 39 patients in the hypothermia group vs two [5%] of 38 patients in the normothermia group; p=0.15). Poor outcomes did not differ between groups (in the hypothermia group, 16 [42%] patients had a poor outcome by GOS and 18 [47%] had a poor outcome by GOS-extended paediatrics; in the normothermia group, 16 [42%] patients had a poor outcome by GOS and 19 [51%] of 37 patients had a poor outcome by GOS-extended paediatrics). We recorded no between-group differences in the occurrence of adverse events or serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Hypothermia for 48 h with slow rewarming does not reduce mortality of improve global functional outcome after paediatric severe traumatic brain injury.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: In some studies, tight glycemic control with insulin improved outcomes in adults undergoing cardiac surgery, but these benefits are unproven in critically ill children at risk for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. We tested the hypothesis that tight glycemic control reduces morbidity after pediatric cardiac surgery. METHODS: In this two-center, prospective, randomized trial, we enrolled 980 children, 0 to 36 months of age, undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were randomly assigned to either tight glycemic control (with the use of an insulin-dosing algorithm targeting a blood glucose level of 80 to 110 mg per deciliter [4.4 to 6.1 mmol per liter]) or standard care in the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). Continuous glucose monitoring was used to guide the frequency of blood glucose measurement and to detect impending hypoglycemia. The primary outcome was the rate of health care-associated infections in the cardiac ICU. Secondary outcomes included mortality, length of stay, organ failure, and hypoglycemia. RESULTS: A total of 444 of the 490 children assigned to tight glycemic control (91%) received insulin versus 9 of 490 children assigned to standard care (2%). Although normoglycemia was achieved earlier with tight glycemic control than with standard care (6 hours vs. 16 hours, P<0.001) and was maintained for a greater proportion of the critical illness period (50% vs. 33%, P<0.001), tight glycemic control was not associated with a significantly decreased rate of health care-associated infections (8.6 vs. 9.9 per 1000 patient-days, P=0.67). Secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between groups, and tight glycemic control did not benefit high-risk subgroups. Only 3% of the patients assigned to tight glycemic control had severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose <40 mg per deciliter [2.2 mmol per liter]). CONCLUSIONS: Tight glycemic control can be achieved with a low hypoglycemia rate after cardiac surgery in children, but it does not significantly change the infection rate, mortality, length of stay, or measures of organ failure, as compared with standard care.

  Abstract                 = {We assessed the clinical significance of T or B cell clonality and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in adult patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) to identify factors related to prognosis. A total of 30 adult patients with diagnosed HLH were included in the study. In all patients, EBV-DNA in peripheral blood was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and bone marrow cells were examined for clonal rearrangement of T cell receptor gamma(TCRG) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) genes. TCRG clones were detected in 10 patients (33.3%) and IGH clones were detected in 8 patients (26.7%). We found no correlation between clonality and patient outcome. The patients less than 1,000 copies (mL)21 of EBVDNA showed a significantly higher clinical response (P 5 0.008) and longer overall survival (P 5 0.01) than those with high viral load of EBV-DNA. Our results suggest that TCRG and IGH rearrangement do not have any clinical significance in adult patients with HLH, but that high viral load of EBV-DNA may be a risk factor for poor outcomes. In HLH, high viral load of EBV-DNA should thus suggest a prompt approach with aggressive therapeutic interventions.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine incidence, severity, characteristics, and causes of anemia and transfusion requirements in medical intensive care patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: Open prospective clinical study in a 24-bed medical intensive care unit in a tertiary-care university hospital. PATIENTS: Patients (N = 96) treated in the intensive care unit for >3 days. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: Parameters of erythropoiesis and red blood cell metabolism, including hemoglobin, reticulocyte counts, serum iron, transferrin, ferritin, haptoglobin, vitamin B12, folic acid, and erythropoietin concentrations were determined serially. Diagnostic blood loss and red blood cell transfusions were recorded, and the total blood loss was estimated from changes in hemoglobin concentrations and the amount of hemoglobin transfused. MAIN RESULTS: The median hemoglobin concentration was 12.1 g/dL at admission and 11.2 g/dL at the end of the intensive care unit stay. A total of 74 patients (77%) suffered from anemia and received 257 red blood cell units, approximately half of which were given within the first 5 days. Three patients who received 19 red blood cell units were admitted with acute gastrointestinal bleeding, but in the remainder, a median total blood loss of 128 mL/d was not (n = 60) or not solely (n = 11) a result of overt bleeding. Diagnostic blood loss declined from a median of 41 mL on day 1 to <20 mL after 3 wks and contributed 17% (median) to total blood loss. Acute renal failure, fatal outcome, and simplified acute physiology score >38 on admission were associated with a 5.8-, 7.0-, and 2.8-fold increase in total blood loss. Reticulocyte counts and erythropoietin concentrations were inappropriately low for the degree of anemia, and plasma transferrin saturation was mostly <20%. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is frequent and results in a high requirement for red blood cell transfusions in the medical intensive care setting. A major proportion of blood loss is not caused by overt bleeding or diagnostic blood sampling but, rather, may result from various other reasons, e.g., occult gastrointestinal bleeding and renal replacement therapy. The erythropoietic response to anemia is blunted, probably as a consequence of an inappropriate increase in erythropoietin production and diminished iron availability.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database was queried to ascertain current trends in management of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and to determine the prevalence of various surgical techniques. METHODS: The study population (n = 3059 operations) was all index operations in 2002-2007, age 0-18 years with Primary Diagnosis of TOF, and Primary Procedure TOF repair or palliation. Patients with Pulmonary Atresia, Absent Pulmonary Valve, and Atrioventricular Canal were excluded. RESULTS: 294 patients had initial palliation, including 178 neonates. 2534 patients had repair of TOF as the initial operation (primary repair), including 154 neonates. 217 patients had repair of TOF after prior palliation. Of patients who had primary repair (n = 2534), 975 had repair at 3 to 6 months, 614 at 6 months to 1 year, 492 at 1 to 3 months, and 154 at 0 to 30 days. Of patients who had repair following prior palliation (n = 217), 65 had repair in the first 6 months of life, 111 at 6 months to 1 year, and only 41 (18.9%) at more than 1 year of age. Type of repair: Of 2534 primary repairs, 581 (23%) had no ventriculotomy, 571 (23%) had nontransanular patch, 1329 (52%) had transanular patch, and 53 (2%) had right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduits. Of repairs after prior palliation (n = 217), 20 (9%) had no ventriculotomy, 30 (14%) had nontransanular patch, 144 (66%) had transanular patch, and 24 (11%) had conduits. Discharge mortality (95% confidence interval; CI) was 22 of 294 (7.5%; CI: 4.7%-11.1%) for initial palliation, 33 of 2534 (1.3%; CI: 0.9%-1.8%) for primary repair, and 2 of 217 (0.9%; CI: 0.1%-3.3%) for secondary repair. For neonates, discharge mortality was 11 of 178 (6.2%; CI: 3.1%-10.8%) for palliation and 12 of 154 (7.8%; CI: 4.1%-13.2%) for primary repair. CONCLUSIONS: Primary repair in the first year of life is the most prevalent strategy. Despite contemporary awareness of the late consequences of pulmonary insufficiency, ventriculotomy with transanular patch remains the most prevalent technique, both for primary repair and for repair following palliation.},

  Abstract                 = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with a systemic hyperadrenergic state. Through activation of beta adrenoreceptors, catecholamines may induce hypermetabolism and increase both cardiac and cerebral oxygen demands. We conducted a systematic review to appraise the available evidence examining the safety and efficacy of beta blockers in patients with acute TBI.We systematically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the reference lists of relevant articles from database inception until March 19, 2013. The outcomes assessed were in-hospital mortality, functional outcome and quality of life. Common adverse effects of beta blockers were examined including clinically significant hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm and congestive heart failure. Data on study outcomes and quality were abstracted in duplicate. The results were summarized descriptively and quantitatively.One randomized controlled trial was found with a high risk of bias. Eight retrospective cohort studies were found with a moderate risk of bias; however, only four of these studies were identified as unique after excluding overlapping cases. The cohort studies reported mortality outcomes; however, none of these included studies assessed functional outcomes or quality of life. Meta-analysis on the cohort studies (n = 4,782 patients) demonstrated that exposure to beta blockers after TBI was associated with a reduction in the adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality by 65 \% (pooled adjusted odds ratio 0.35; 95 \% CI 0.27-0.45).The current body of evidence is suggestive of a benefit of beta blockers following TBI. However, methodologically sound randomized controlled trials are indicated to confirm the efficacy of beta blockers in patients with TBI.},

  Abstract                 = {Decompressive craniectomy and barbiturate coma are often used as second-tier strategies when intracranial hypertension following severe traumatic brain injury is refractory to first-line treatments. Uncertainty surrounds the decision to choose either treatment option. We investigated which strategy is more economically attractive in this context.We performed a cost-utility analysis. A Markov Monte Carlo microsimulation model with a life-long time horizon was created to compare quality-adjusted survival and cost of the two treatment strategies, from the perspective of healthcare payer. Model parameters were estimated from the literature. Two-dimensional simulation was used to incorporate parameter uncertainty into the model. Value of information analysis was conducted to identify major drivers of decision uncertainty and focus future research.Trauma centers in the United States.Base case was a population of patients (mean age = 25 yr) who developed refractory intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury.We compared two treatment strategies: decompressive craniectomy and barbiturate coma.Decompressive craniectomy was associated with an average gain of 1.5 quality-adjusted life years relative to barbiturate coma, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $9,565/quality-adjusted life year gained. Decompressive craniectomy resulted in a greater quality-adjusted life expectancy 86\% of the time and was more cost-effective than barbiturate coma in 78\% of cases if our willingness-to-pay threshold is $50,000/quality-adjusted life year and 82\% of cases at a threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year. At older age, decompressive craniectomy continued to increase survival but at higher cost (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $197,906/quality-adjusted life year at mean age = 85 yr).Based on available evidence, decompressive craniectomy for the treatment of refractory intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury provides better value in terms of costs and health gains than barbiturate coma. However, decompressive craniectomy might be less economically attractive for older patients. Further research, particularly on natural history of severe traumatic brain injury patients, is needed to make more informed treatment decisions.},

  Abstract                 = {The optimal timing of tracheostomy in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is controversial; observational studies have been challenged through confounding by indication, and interventional studies have rarely enrolled patients with isolated TBI.We included a cohort of adults with isolated TBI who underwent tracheostomy within 1 of 135 participating centers in the American College of Surgeons' Trauma Quality Improvement Program, during 2009 to 2011. Patients were classified as having undergone early tracheostomy (ET, ?8 days) versus late tracheostomy (>8 days). Outcomes were compared between propensity score-matched groups to reduce confounding by indication. In sensitivity analyses, we used time-dependent proportional hazard regression to address immortal time bias and assessed the association between hospital ET rate and patients' outcome at the hospital level.From 1,811 patients, a well-balanced propensity-matched cohort of 1,154 patients was defined. After matching, ET was associated with fewer mechanical ventilation days (median, 10 days vs. 16 days; rate ratio [RR], 0.70; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.75), shorter intensive care unit stay (median, 13 days vs. 19 days; RR, 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.75), shorter hospital length of stay (median, 20 days vs. 27 days; RR, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.74-0.86), and lower odds of pneumonia (41.7\% vs. 52.7\%; odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95\% CI, 0.51-0.80), deep venous thrombosis (8.2\% vs. 14.4\%; OR, 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.37-0.78), and decubitus ulcer (4.0\% vs. 8.9\%; OR, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.26-0.71) but no significant difference in pulmonary embolism (1.8\% vs. 3.3\%; OR, 0.52; 95\% CI, 0.24-1.10). Hospital mortality was similar between both groups (8.4\% vs. 6.8\%; OR, 1.25; 95\% CI, 0.80-1.96). Results were consistent using several alternate analytic methods.In this observational study, ET was associated with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, and hospital stay but not hospital mortality. ET may represent a mechanism to reduce in-hospital morbidity for patients with TBI.Therapeutic study, level II.},

  Abstract                 = {Batteries of functional and cognitive measures have been proposed as alternatives to the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) as the primary outcome for traumatic brain injury (TBI) trials. We evaluated several approaches to analyzing GOSE and a battery of four functional and cognitive measures. Using data from a randomized trial, we created a 'super' dataset of 16,550 subjects from patients with complete data (n=331) and then simulated multiple treatment effects across multiple outcome measures. Patients were sampled with replacement (bootstrapping) to generate 10,000 samples for each treatment effect (n=400 patients/group). The percentage of samples where the null hypothesis was rejected estimates the power. All analytic techniques had appropriate rates of Type-I error (?5\%). Accounting for baseline prognosis, either by using sliding dichotomy for GOSE or using regression-based methods substantially increased the power over the corresponding analysis without accounting for prognosis. Analyzing GOSE using multivariate proportional odds regression or analyzing the 4-outcome battery with regression-based adjustments had the highest power, assuming equal treatment effect across all components. Analyzing GOSE using a fixed dichotomy provided the lowest power for both unadjusted and regression-adjusted analyses. We assumed an equal treatment effect for all measures. This may not be true in an actual clinical trial. Accounting for baseline prognosis is critical to attaining high power in Phase III TBI trials. The choice of primary outcome for future trials should be guided by power, the domain of brain function that an intervention is likely to impact, and the feasibility of collecting outcome data.},

  Abstract                 = {These studies were undertaken to evaluate human microvascular endothelial cell (MEC) synthesis of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, under in vitro conditions of ischemia and reperfusion. IL-8 and other related CXC chemokines are believed to mediate tissue injury in a variety of pathologic conditions in humans. MEC grown on microcarrier beads were exposed to 3 or 6 h of in vitro ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Conditioned medium, MEC protein, and total RNA extracts were assayed for IL-8 using an ELISA. During ischemia alone, MEC increased intracellular, but not extracellular levels of IL-8 secretion. In contrast, reperfusion markedly stimulated both intracellular and extracellular IL-8 secretion. Neither 3 h of ischemia alone or followed by reperfusion altered steady-state levels of IL-8 mRNA when compared to pre-ischemic levels. In contrast, after 6 h of ischemia alone and ischemia followed by reperfusion, IL-8 mRNA was increased eight- and sixfold, respectively, when compared to pre-ischemic levels. These studies demonstrate an inverse relationship between the rate of IL-8 protein secretion and the steady-state levels of IL-8 mRNA during ischemia and reperfusion. During ischemia and reperfusion both the increase in cell-associated IL-8 protein and the release of IL-8 into the medium is dependent on de novo protein synthesis rather than the intracellular accumulation of IL-8. These experiments indicate that post-ischemic modulation of IL-8 release and synthesis following ischemia reperfusion will require strategies directed towards inhibition of IL-8 transcription and in depth knowledge of the mechanisms regulating IL-8 secretion.},

  Abstract                 = {A consecutive series of 330 severely head-injured patients was studied prospectively. All of the patients were treated with the same protocols by the same physicians and staff in the same intensive care unit. All of the patients had intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Of the 330 patients, 100 were in the pediatric age group (0 to 19 years of age) and 230 were in the adult group (20 to 80 years of age). Statistical analyses were performed with regard to outcome, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, ICP course, and incidence of surgical lesions. The average emergency room GCS score as well as the 24-hour GCS score for each group was the same. The percentage of patients having ICP that was normal, increased but reducible, and increased but not reducible in each group was the same. The pediatric patients had a significantly higher percentage of good outcomes (43%) than the adult patients (28%) (p less than 0.01). They also had a significantly lower mortality rate (24%) than the adult patients (45%) (p less than 0.01). At 1 year following injury, 55% of pediatric patients had a good outcome compared to 21% of adults (p less than 0.001); this trend was evident at 3 months, with the same p value. Pediatric patients with normal ICP had a higher percentage of good outcomes (70%) than the adult patients with normal ICP (48%) (p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in outcome in pediatric and adult patients with mass lesions or with increased ICP, regardless of whether or not the pressure was reducible. There was a much higher incidence of surgical mass lesions in adult patients (46%) than in pediatric patients (24%) (p less than 0.001).},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Breast-conserving therapy (BCT) has emerged as the preferred treatment for most women with early stage breast cancer. However, there is concern for underuse in the elderly, with previously documented low rates of BCT and large variations in practice patterns. The authors' purpose was to examine patterns and correlates of BCT for breast cancer in the elderly US population. METHODS: The primary outcome was receipt of BCT. The 2003 to 2004 Medicare inpatient, outpatient, and carrier files were used to identify incident breast cancer patients and the American Medical Association to ascertain surgeon information. The primary independent variables were US state where treatment was performed along with patient and surgeon sociodemographic information. Multivariate logistic regression was used for the analyses. RESULTS: BCT was performed in 81.8% of patients (N = 20,032). Variation in use of BCT across states was low, ranging from 74.2% in Utah to 84.0% in New Mexico. Several factors were significantly associated with low use of BCT: advanced patient age (>85 vs <70 years: odds ratio [OR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.59); comorbidities (>3 vs </= 3: OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.24-0.28), and low socioeconomic status (SES) (lowest quintile vs highest quintile SES: OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.52-0.68). Variation in use of BCT by surgeon was low, although female surgeons aged 40 to 49 years and >/= 60 years had significantly higher use compared with younger men. CONCLUSIONS: BCT has become the primary management among elderly breast cancer patients. Despite earlier studies to the contrary, there is now little variation in BCT use among Medicare patients.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Death from severe sepsis and septic shock is common, and researchers have explored whether antibodies to the endotoxins in some bacteria reduces mortality. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with bacterial sepsis or septic shock on mortality, bacteriological failure rates, and duration of stay in hospital. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group specialized register up to November 2001; the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Library issue 4, 2001; MEDLINE 1966 to November 2001; and EMBASE 1988 to September 2001. We contacted investigators active in the field for unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing intravenous immunoglobulin (monoclonal or polyclonal) with placebo or no intervention, in patients with bacterial sepsis or septic shock. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Inclusion criteria, trial quality assessment, and data abstraction were done in duplicate. We conducted pre-specified subgroup analyses by type of immunoglobulin preparation. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-seven out of 55 studies met our inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis of all types of IVIG preparations revealed a significant trend toward reduction of mortality (n= 8,856; RR=0.91; 95%CI 0.86-0.96). Overall mortality was reduced in patients who received polyclonal IVIG (n=492; RR=0.64; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.80). For the two high-quality trials on polyclonal IVIG, the RR for overall mortality was 0.30, but the confidence interval was wide (95% CI 0.09 to 0.99, n=91). Mortality was not reduced among patients who received monoclonal antibodies such as anti-endotoxins (n=2,826 in 5 good-quality studies; RR=0.97; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.07) or anti-cytokines (n=4,318; RR=0.93; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01). A few studies measured secondary outcomes (deaths from sepsis or length of hospitalisation) but no differences in the intervention and control groups were identified except among those who received polyclonal IVIG, where sepsis-related mortality was significantly reduced (n=161; RR=0.35; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.69). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Polyclonal IVIG significantly reduced mortality and and is a promising adjuvant in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock. However, all the trials were small and the totality of the evidence is insufficient to support a robust conclusion of benefit. Adjunctive therapy with monoclonal IVIGs remains experimental.},

  Abstract                 = {Severely head-injured patients require significant resources across the continuum of care. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of the level of trauma center designation on the outcome of the severely head-injured patient. The National Trauma Data Bank between 2001 and 2006 (NTDB 6.2) was queried for all patients with isolated traumatic head injury and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) less than 9. Comparisons between Level I and Level II trauma centers were made reviewing hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit LOS, ventilator days, major complication rate (pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis), mortality, and discharge status. Chi-square and Student t tests were used to determine statistical significance defined as P < 0.05. There were 31,736 patients from 258 facilities who met the inclusion criteria during the study period. Level I trauma centers had approximately twice as many patients admissions as Level II centers. However, the severity of injuries and patients' characteristics identified by the emergency department GCS as well as the probability of survival score showed no difference between Level I and Level II centers. The comparisons between Level I and Level II trauma centers shows that Level II centers are not inferior to Level I in terms of outcomes and complication rate. Level II trauma centers encounter patients with isolated complex head injury less often but with outcomes and complication rates comparable to that of Level I centers. The transport of head-injured patients should not bypass Level II in favor of Level I.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: There are a variety of different products available for laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs (LVHR), which vary widely in their costs. There are few clinical studies commenting on cost efficacy of LVHR. The objective of this study is to investigate the cost, safety, and efficacy of using intraperitoneal nonheavyweight polypropylene (PP) mesh in LVHR. METHODS: Between the years 2002 and 2006, LVHR was performed in 141 consecutive patients (84 male, 57 female) using intraperitoneal PP. Using a 3-trocar technique, PP mesh was underlayed by 3 to 5 cm beyond the edges of the hernia defect and fixed to the abdominal wall with 2 rows of titanium staples. Data concerning the demographics of patients, mesh cost, operative time, length of hospital stay, and complications were collected. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-four patients (95%) were discharged on the day of surgery. Mean age was 58.7 years (range, 29 to 91 y). Mean operative time was 63 minutes (range, 34 to 124 min). Follow-up was achieved in 123 patients (87%) with a mean of 40 months (range, 12 to 68 mo). The average mesh size was 256.9 cm (range, 116 to 903 cm). The cost of the PP mesh was US$0.14 per cm. The average mesh cost per patient was $35.90. When compared with other meshes commonly used for LVHR, PP mesh was substantially cheaper with a cost saving of $436 per patient with proceed, $770 per patient with composix, and $931 per patient with polytetrafluoroethylene. The postoperative complications included: Wound infection n=4 (3.2%), transient partial small bowel obstruction which resolved in all cases without operative management n=3 (2.4%), port site hernia n=2 (1.6%), and seroma n=1 (0.7%). Overall recurrence rate was n=6 (4.8%). There were no conversions to an open procedure. CONCLUSIONS: LVHR with intraperitoneal PP results in outcomes comparable with earlier publications on LVHR but at reduced costs. These data suggest that the use of intraperitoneal PP in LVHR is safe and cost effective.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Resuscitation of pediatric cardiac patients involves unique and complex physiology, requiring multidisciplinary collaboration and teamwork. To optimize team performance, we created a multidisciplinary Crisis Resource Management training course that addressed both teamwork and technical skill needs for the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit. We sought to determine whether participation improved caregiver comfort and confidence levels regarding future resuscitation events. METHODS: We developed a simulation-based, in situ Crisis Resource Management curriculum using pediatric cardiac intensive care unit scenarios and unit-specific resuscitation equipment, including an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit. Participants replicated the composition of a clinical team. Extensive video-based debriefing followed each scenario, focusing on teamwork principles and technical resuscitation skills. Pre- and postparticipation questionnaires were used to determine the effects on participants' comfort and confidence regarding participation in future resuscitations. RESULTS: A total of 182 providers (127 nurses, 50 physicians, 2 respiratory therapists, 3 nurse practitioners) participated in the course. All participants scored the usefulness of the program and scenarios as 4 of 5 or higher (5 = most useful). There was significant improvement in participants' perceived ability to function as a code team member and confidence in a code (P < .001). Participants reported they were significantly more likely to raise concerns about inappropriate management to the code leader (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a Crisis Resource Management training program in a pediatric cardiac intensive care unit to teach technical resuscitation skills and improve team function. Participants found the experience useful and reported improved ability to function in a code. Further work is needed to determine whether participation in the Crisis Resource Management program objectively improves team function during real resuscitations.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a potentially lethal condition characterized by a pathologic inflammation. The diagnostic criteria for HLH include fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, abnormal natural killer cell (NK cell) functional assay, elevated soluble IL-2Ralpha level, and elevated ferritin level (>500 microg/L). Institution of timely therapy in these critically ill patients may be delayed by difficulties establishing the diagnosis. NK cell functional assay and soluble IL-2Ralpha level may require send-out to a specialized lab. However, ferritin level is available on a same-day basis at most institutions. In this study, we examined the utility of quantitative ferritin levels in diagnosing HLH. PROCEDURE: All patients with ferritin values >500 microg/L obtained at Texas Children's Hospital between January 10, 2003 and January 10, 2005 were identified. Patient charts were reviewed for ferritin levels and hospital course. RESULTS: During the study interval, 330 patients had ferritin levels >500 microg/L. Ten of the 330 patients were diagnosed with HLH. A ferritin level over 10,000 microg/L was 90% sensitive and 96% specific for HLH. Another diagnostic category with significantly elevated ferritin level was illness of unknown cause (n = 10), and only two of these patients were fully evaluated for HLH. CONCLUSIONS: Ferritin levels above 10,000 microg/L appear to be specific and sensitive for HLH. In patients without a significant medical history and a new onset of febrile illness with highly elevated ferritin levels, the diagnosis of HLH should be evaluated.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device is superior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for bridge to heart transplantation. Published data are limited to 1 in 4 children who received the device as part of the US clinical trial. We analyzed outcomes for all US children who received the EXCOR to characterize device outcomes in an unselected cohort and to identify risk factors for mortality to facilitate patient selection. METHODS AND RESULTS: This multicenter, prospective cohort study involved all children implanted with the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric ventricular assist device at 47 centers from May 2007 through December 2010. Multiphase nonproportional hazards modeling was used to identify risk factors for early (<2 months) and late mortality. Of 204 children supported with the EXCOR, the median duration of support was 40 days (range, 1-435 days). Survival at 12 months was 75%, including 64% who reached transplantation, 6% who recovered, and 5% who were alive on the device. Multivariable analysis identified lower weight, biventricular assist device support, and elevated bilirubin as risk factors for early mortality and bilirubin extremes and renal dysfunction as risk factors for late mortality. Neurological dysfunction occurred in 29% and was the leading cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the Berlin Heart EXCOR has risen dramatically over the past decade. The EXCOR has emerged as a new treatment standard in the United States for pediatric bridge to transplantation. Three-quarters of children survived to transplantation or recovery; an important fraction experienced neurological dysfunction. Smaller patient size, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, and biventricular assist device use were associated with mortality, whereas extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before implantation and congenital heart disease were not.},

The disc space narrowing, vertebral body erosion and pseudocystis, in presence of polyarthropathy, chronic renal failure, and carpal tunnel syndrome, allows to make a diagnosis of DSA, which is proved by histological finding of beta2 microglobulin-amyloid.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Pim (proviral insertion in murine lymphoma) kinases are a small family of constitutively active, highly conservative serine/threonine oncogenic kinases and have 3 members: Pim1, Pim2, and Pim3. Pim kinases are also implicated in the regulation of B- and T- cell responses to cytokines and hematopoietic growth factors. The roles of Pim kinases in the regulation of primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are largely unknown. METHODS: In the current study, Pim1-/-2-/-3-/- triple knockout (TKO) mice were used to determine the role of Pim kinases in hematopoiesis. Peripheral blood hematological parameters were measured in Pim TKO mice and age-matched wild-type (WT) controls. Primary, secondary, and competitive transplantations were performed to assay the long-term repopulating HSCs in Pim TKO mice. In vivo BrdU incorporation assay and ex vivo Ki67 staining and caspase 3 labeling were performed to evaluate the proliferation and apoptosis of HSCs in Pim TKO mice. RESULTS: Compared to age-matched WT controls, Pim TKO mice had lower peripheral blood platelet count and exhibited erythrocyte hypochromic microcytosis. The bone marrow cells from Pim TKO mice demonstrated decreased hematopoietic progenitor colony-forming ability. Importantly, Pim TKO bone marrow cells had significantly impaired capacity in rescuing lethally irradiated mice and reconstituting hematopoiesis in primary, secondary and competitive transplant models. In vivo BrdU incorporation in long-term HSCs was reduced in Pim TKO mice. Finally, cultured HSCs from Pim TKO mice showed reduced proliferation evaluated by Ki67 staining and higher rate of apoptosis via caspase 3 activation. CONCLUSIONS: Pim kinases are not only essential in the hematopoietic lineage cell development, but also important in HSC expansion, self-renewal, and long-term repopulation.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the contributions of injury severity, physical and cognitive disability, child and family function to outcome 30 months after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children. DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal, between group design, comparing function before and after injury across three levels of injury severity. SUBJECTS: One hundred and fifty children, 3.0-12.11 years old, admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of TBI. The sample was divided according to injury severity: mild (n = 42), moderate (n = 70), severe (n = 38). Children with a history of neurological, developmental, and psychiatric disorders were excluded from participation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Post injury physical function, cognitive ability (incorporating intellect, memory, and attention), behavioural and family functioning, and level of family burden. RESULTS: A dose-response relation was identified for injury severity and physical and cognitive outcome, with significant recovery documented from acute to six months after TBI. Behavioural functioning was not related to injury severity, and where problems were identified, little recovery was noted over time. Family functioning remained unchanged from preinjury to post injury assessments. The level of family burden was high at both six and 30 months after injury, and was predicted by injury severity, functional impairment, and post injury child behavioural disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest ongoing problems for the child and significant family burden 30 months after TBI. The nature and severity of the physical and cognitive problems are closely related to injury severity, with child and family function predicted by psychosocial and premorbid factors.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common, acquired, childhood disability that may be used as a model to understand more completely the impact of early brain injury on both brain structure and day-to-day function. Contrary to previously held views of the "plasticity" of the young brain, recent research suggests that such early insults may have a profound impact on development. To date, these suggestions remain largely untested. OBJECTIVES: To plot changes in cognitive abilities after childhood TBI over the 30 months after injury and to examine the impact of age at injury on cognitive outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal study. SETTING: Royal Children's Hospital, Victoria, Australia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Global intellectual ability, verbal and nonverbal skills, attention, and processing speed. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 122 children admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of TBI were divided according to injury age, ie, young (age: 3-7 years) or old (age: 8-12 years), and injury severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and were evaluated acutely and at 12 and 30 months after injury. An additional sample of children injured before 3 years of age (n = 27) was compared with these groups with respect to global intellectual ability only. RESULTS: A clear relationship was documented between injury severity and cognitive performance. For children who sustained severe injury, younger age at injury was associated with minimal, if any, recovery after injury, but better outcomes were observed after severe TBI among older children. Age at injury was not predictive of outcomes for children with mild or moderate TBI, although infants (age: 0-2.11 years) with moderate TBI showed poorer outcomes than did older children with injury of similar severity. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support a "double-hazard" model for severe and early brain insults and add to the ongoing debate regarding cerebral plasticity, suggesting that, contrary to traditional views, young children who sustain severe TBI in early childhood or moderate or severe TBI in infancy may be particularly vulnerable to significant residual cognitive impairment. From a clinical perspective, results indicate that long-term follow-up monitoring and management should be targeted to this high-risk group.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: A number of common non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA repair genes have been reported to modify bladder cancer risk. These include: APE1-Asn148Gln, XRCC1-Arg399Gln and XRCC1-Arg194Trp in the BER pathway, XPD-Gln751Lys in the NER pathway and XRCC3-Thr241Met in the DSB repair pathway. METHODS: To examine the independent and interacting effects of these SNPs in a large study group, we analyzed these genotypes in 1,029 cases and 1,281 controls enrolled in two case-control studies of incident bladder cancer, one conducted in New Hampshire, USA and the other in Turin, Italy. RESULTS: The odds ratio among current smokers with the variant XRCC3-241 (TT) genotype was 1.7 (95% CI 1.0-2.7) compared to wild-type. We evaluated gene-environment and gene-gene interactions using four analytic approaches: logistic regression, Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR), hierarchical interaction graphs, classification and regression trees (CART), and logic regression analyses. All five methods supported a gene-gene interaction between XRCC1-399/XRCC3-241 (p = 0.001) (adjusted OR for XRCC1-399 GG, XRCC3-241 TT vs. wild-type 2.0 (95% CI 1.4-3.0)). Three methods predicted an interaction between XRCC1-399/XPD-751 (p = 0.008) (adjusted OR for XRCC1-399 GA or AA, XRCC3-241 AA vs. wild-type 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-2.0)). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes modify bladder cancer risk and highlight the value of using multiple complementary analytic approaches to identify multi-factor interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Two recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) decreased the incidence of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or death in term and near-term newborns with hypoxic respiratory failure. Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness ratio of iNO in this population. METHODS: We studied 1000 simulation cohorts (n = 483 for each cohort) of term/near-term newborns with hypoxemic respiratory failure. We conducted our study following US Public Health Service Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine guidelines, adopting the US societal perspective. We constructed a decision tree reflecting iNO use, subsequent ECMO use, death, and long-term neurologic and respiratory morbidity in survivors, as determined from the combined outcomes of the 2 RCTs (n = 483). We estimated costs on the basis of length-of-stay data for the initial episode of care from 1 of the RCTs, unit costs from administrative data sets, and current pricing for iNO. We ran a Monte Carlo simulation to generate estimates of differences in costs and effects at 1 year, along with the stochastic uncertainty around these estimates. We expressed effects as quality-adjusted survival, assuming quality of life = 1 with no comorbidity, 0.7 with 1 comorbidity, and 0.49 (0.7 x 0.7) with 2 comorbidities. We constructed a base case, in which iNO was initiated at tertiary care ECMO centers (mimicking the RCTs) and a Public Health Service Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine reference case, in which iNO was initiated at the local hospital before transfer (mimicking real-world practice). We exposed our assumptions to a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Direct application of the trial results (base case) suggested that iNO was both more effective and cheaper (cost savings of 1880 dollars per case despite acquisition costs of 5150 dollars, predominantly as a result of decreased need for ECMO), with 84.6% probability that the cost-effectiveness ratio was better than 100,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year. Under the reference case, iNO was also more effective (though slightly less so) and was even cheaper (cost savings of 4400 dollars per case), with 71.6% probability that iNO was cheaper and more effective and 91.6% probability that the cost effectiveness ratio was better than 100,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity analyses showed these estimates to be sensitive to patient selection and the price of iNO but insensitive to assumptions regarding quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: From a US societal perspective, iNO has a favorable cost-effectiveness profile when initiated either at ECMO centers or at local hospitals in term/near-term neonates with hypoxemic respiratory failure.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Septic shock may be associated with relative adrenal insufficiency. Thus, a replacement therapy of low doses of corticosteroids has been proposed to treat septic shock. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether low doses of corticosteroids improve 28-day survival in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency. DESIGN AND SETTING: Placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial performed in 19 intensive care units in France from October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999. PATIENTS: Three hundred adult patients who fulfilled usual criteria for septic shock were enrolled after undergoing a short corticotropin test. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydrocortisone (50-mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours) and fludrocortisone (50- micro g tablet once daily) (n = 151) or matching placebos (n = 149) for 7 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Twenty-eight-day survival distribution in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency (nonresponders to the corticotropin test). RESULTS: One patient from the corticosteroid group was excluded from analyses because of consent withdrawal. There were 229 nonresponders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36). In nonresponders, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.95; P =.02). Vasopressor therapy was withdrawn within 28 days in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-2.84; P =.001). There was no significant difference between groups in responders. Adverse events rates were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: In our trial, a 7-day treatment with low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone significantly reduced the risk of death in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency without increasing adverse events.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: The National Cancer Institute-funded cooperative oncology group trials have improved overall survival for children with cancer from 10% to 85% and have set standards of care for adults with malignancies. Despite these successes, cooperative oncology groups currently face substantial challenges. We are working to develop methods to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these trials. Specifically, we merged data from the Children's Oncology Group (COG) and the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) to improve toxicity monitoring, to estimate treatment-associated resource utilization and costs, and to address important clinical epidemiology questions. METHODS: COG and PHIS data on patients enrolled on a phase III COG trial for de novo acute myeloid leukemia at 43 PHIS hospitals were merged using a probabilistic algorithm. Resource utilization summary statistics were then tabulated for the first chemotherapy course based on PHIS data. RESULTS: Of 416 patients enrolled on the phase III COG trial at PHIS centers, 392 (94%) were successfully matched. Of these, 378 (96%) had inpatient PHIS data available beginning at the date of study enrollment. For these, daily blood product usage and anti-infective exposures were tabulated and standardized costs were described. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that patients enrolled in a cooperative group oncology trial can be successfully identified in an administrative data set and that supportive care resource utilization can be described.

  Abstract                 = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a leading cause of childhood death and disability worldwide. Seizures are a common complication of TBI and they are particularly common in pediatric populations. The proper management of children sustaining severe TBI is still controversial. Our study aims to share our experience contributing to build evidence for better care.Retrospective chart review was performed on individuals ages 0 to <18 who presented to a level 1 trauma center during a 10-year period with the diagnosis of severe TBI. Data analyzed included patient's demographics, event information, clinical and radiological presentation, management, and midterm follow-up. Presence of seizures was tracked through EEG monitoring, staff witnessing, or guardian referral.The incidence of early posttraumatic seizures (EPTS) observed in our population (19 \%) exceeds those previously reported. Such findings likely reflect the importance of close monitoring including EEG. An association between the presence of EPTS and the development of late posttraumatic seizures (LPTS) was evidenced (p=0.001; 95 \% CI 2.2, 16.5), while this association should not be assumed as a measure of causality, it should be considered for the management of patients presenting EPTS. Non-accidental trauma and young age were identified as independent predictors for the development of seizures.Seizures are a common complication of severe TBI among children aged 0-3 years. Given the detrimental effects that seizures produce on the injured brain, close observation and appropriate monitoring with EEG are essential for the management of children sustaining severe TBI.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past 20 years it has become increasingly apparent that hyponatremic encephalopathy is a major cause of inhospital morbidity and mortality, particularly in postoperative patients. The factors that may lead to death or permanent brain damage and the susceptible patient groups have been gradually elucidated. Hyponatremic encephalopathy most commonly leads to brain damage in young women and in prepubescent children. The causes of brain damage include brain edema, cerebral hypoxemia, decreased brain blood flow, increased intracranial pressure, and improper therapy. Cerebral hypoxia occurs through a combination of impaired brain adaptation and cerebral vasoconstriction. Brain adaptation consists largely of brain cell loss of sodium and potassium by means of the Na-K adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) system. There is also loss of organic osmolytes. The brain Na-K ATPase system is impaired by a combination of vasopressin plus estrogen and is stimulated by testosterone. Similarly, vasopressin plus estrogen leads to cerebral vasoconstriction, resulting in a decrement of brain oxygen utilization and cerebral blood flow. Vasopressin also directly decreases brain production of ATP. The combination leads to hypoxic brain damage, which appears to be the major cause of brain damage associated with hyponatremic encephalopathy. Measurement of arterial PO2 in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia usually demonstrates a PO2 <50 mm Hg. Improper therapy is another possible cause of brain damage in patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy. The type and distribution of such lesions are similar to those found in patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy who have severe hypoxia. Current scientific knowledge indicates that patient survival can be improved through aggressive treatment of hypoxia associated with hyponatremic encephalopathy, particularly in young women.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and to characterize the determinants of red blood cell transfusions in critically ill children. DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive epidemiologic study. SETTING: A single-center, multidisciplinary, tertiary care level, university-affiliated, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). PATIENTS: Critically ill children. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 1,047 consecutive admissions over a 1-yr period, 985 were retained for study. At least one transfusion was given in 139 cases (14%). Incidence rate of transfusion was 304 transfusions/1,000 cases. Possible determinants of red blood cell transfusions were identified and prospectively monitored during PICU stay until a first transfusion event (transfused cases) or up until the time of death or discharge from PICU (nontransfused cases). Four significant determinants of a first red blood cell transfusion event were retained in the multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, p): a hemoglobin level <9.5 g/dL during PICU stay (13.26, 8.04-21.88, p < .001), an admission diagnosis of cardiac disease (8.07, 5.14-14.65, p < .001), an admission Pediatric Risk of Mortality score >10 (4.83, 2.33-10.04, p < .001), and the presence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome during the stay (2.06, 1.18-3.57, p = .01). CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of critically ill children receive at least one red blood cell transfusion during their PICU stay. Presence of anemia, cardiac disease, severe critical illness, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome are the most significant determinants of red blood cell transfusions in PICU.},

Appropriate classification of pediatric posttraumatic seizure subtypes can be helpful for appropriate management and prognosis. This review will focus on early posttraumatic seizures, and the subtypes of early posttraumatic seizure. Incidence, risk factors, diagnosis, seizure semiology, status epilepticus, management, risk of recurrence, and prognosis were reviewed. The integration of continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring into pediatric traumatic brain injury management may hold the key to better characterizing and understanding pediatric early posttraumatic seizures.

  Abstract                 = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, and early posttraumatic seizures (EPTS) are a contributing factor to ongoing acute damage. Continuous video-EEG monitoring (cEEG) was utilized to assess the burden of clinical and electrographic EPTS.Eighty-seven consecutive, unselected (mild - severe), acute TBI patients requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission at two academic centers were monitored prospectively with cEEG per established clinical TBI protocols. Clinical and subclinical seizures and status epilepticus (SE, clinical and subclinical) were assessed for their relation to clinical risk factors and short-term outcome measures.Of all patients, 42.5\% (37/87) had seizures. Younger age (p = 0.002) and injury mechanism (abusive head trauma - AHT, p < 0.001) were significant risk factors. Subclinical seizures occurred in 16.1\% (14/87), while 6.9\% (6/87) had only subclinical seizures. Risk factors for subclinical seizures included younger age (p < 0.001), AHT (p < 0.001), and intraaxial bleed (p < 0.001). SE occurred in 18.4\% (16/87) with risk factors including younger age (p < 0.001), AHT (p < 0.001), and intraaxial bleed (p = 0.002). Subclinical SE was detected in 13.8\% (12/87) with significant risk factors including younger age (p < 0.001), AHT (p = 0.001), and intraaxial bleed (p = 0.004). Subclinical seizures were associated with lower discharge King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI) score (p = 0.002). SE and subclinical SE were associated with increased hospital length of stay (p = 0.017 and p = 0.041, respectively) and lower hospital discharge KOSCHI (p = 0.007 and p = 0.040, respectively).cEEG monitoring significantly improves detection of seizures/SE and is the only way to detect subclinical seizures/SE. cEEG may be indicated after pediatric TBI, particularly in younger children, AHT cases, and those with intraaxial blood on computerized tomography (CT).},

  Abstract                 = {Posttraumatic epilepsy in the pediatric age group is mostly seen within the first week. An acute posttraumatic epileptic fit, which may induce secondary insults, should be hindered. The aim of the study is to define the risk factors for posttraumatic early epilepsy (PTEE) and the indications for prophylactic therapy.In this survey, a total of 1,785 pediatric patients--under the age of 16--are studied. The majority of the patients (1,655) were treated in Haydarpaşa Numune Hospital within the years 1993-1999. The rest, which consists of 130 patients, were treated in Inönü University Turgut Ozal Medical Center between the years 2001 and 2003. The patients were categorized according to age, gender, neurological manifestations, type of trauma, cranial pathology, number and type of epileptic fits, the interval between trauma and convulsion, electroencephalogram findings, and antiepileptic therapy. All these factors were challenged due to their effect on the evolution of PTEE.Only 149 cases had PTEE (8.4\%). There was no correlation between gender and the incidence of PTEE. The data showed that 11.7\% of the patients at or under the age of 3 (p=0.00072), 30.8\% of the patients with severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale=3-8; Children's Coma Scale = 3-8; p=0.00000), 19.3\% of the patients with depressed skull fractures (p=0.00038), 13.7\% of the patients with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (p=0.0000072), and 21.6\% of the patients with cerebral edema (p=0.000008) had PTEE. Only 20\% of the patients with PTEE had a Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of 3 or less (p=0.0000075).Those patients at or under the age of 3, with severe head injury, cerebral edema, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or depressed skull fracture, have a higher incidence of PTEE. Moreover, because the GOS of these patients are prone to be worse, antiepileptic therapy in acute stage may be effective in preventing the secondary brain damage.},

  Abstract                 = {The "epidemiology of knowledge" underlying clinical decision making related to antibiotic therapy is one of the most important determinants of how such therapy is used, misused, or not used. A growing literature describes how prescribers and patients acquire the information that influences them in their utilization of these agents. The quality and content of this information ultimately determine whether a given microorganism will ever meet a particular drug. Most evidence indicates that there is considerable room for improvement in such decision making. Research data, including those from randomized controlled trials, have been used to compare the efficacy of several methods of improving the flow of information about proper antibiotic use. While traditional passive forms of education are not powerful means of changing prescribing behavior, innovative approaches, including person-to-person tutorials, can improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing. Benefit-cost analysis documents that these programs can save more than they cost. Additional research on these questions will be a powerful way of maximizing both effectiveness and efficiency in the treatment of infectious diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Hypoxia appears to be a prominent component of brain damage among patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy. Effects of hypoxia on brain in the presence of hyponatremia are not known. In order to evaluate the contributions of hypoxia to brain damage, three separate experiments were conducted in three groups of rodents. Experiment I evaluated the effects of hypoxia and acute (< 4 h) hyponatremia (plasma Na < 120 mmol/l) on brain adaptation in rabbits. Experiment II evaluated the effects of hypoxia and chronic (4 days) hyponatremia on cerebral perfusion in rats. Experiment III evaluated the effects of hypoxia and chronic hyponatremia on brain histology in rats. In experiment I, rabbits with acute hyponatremia demonstrated brain adaptation with significant falls in brain Na content (by 14.2%, P < 0.01) and osmolality (by 8.3%, P < 0.01), and a rise in brain water (by 10.6%, P < 0.05). Rabbits with combined hypoxia and hyponatremia failed to demonstrate brain adaptation. In experiment II, rats with chronic hyponatremia plus hypoxia had a decrease in cerebral perfusion index by more than 50% (P < 0.01). In experiment III, 23% of hypoxic rats had brain lesions, which were in the cerebellum, thalamus, reticular formation, and basal ganglia. Hyponatremia without hypoxia resulted in no brain lesions. Hypoxia in normonatremic animals results in cerebral edema and histopathologic lesions similar to those found in rats whose plasma Na was overcorrected. Hypoxia in hyponatremic animals aggravates cerebral edema, impairs brain adaptation, and decreases cerebral perfusion.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECT The objective of this work was to search a national health care database of patients diagnosed with cervical spine fractures in the US to analyze discharge, demographic, and hospital charge trends over a 10-year period. METHODS Clinical data were derived from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for the years 1997 through 2006. The NIS is maintained by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and represents a 20% random stratified sample of all discharges from nonfederal hospitals within the US. Patients with cervical spine fractures with and without spinal cord injury (SCI) were identified using the appropriate ICD-9-CM codes. The volume of discharges, length of stay (LOS), hospital charges, total national charges, discharge pattern, age, and sex were analyzed. National estimates were calculated using the HCUPnet tool. RESULTS Approximately 200,000 hospitalizations were identified. In the non-SCI group, there was a 74% increase in hospitalizations and charges between 1997 and 2006, but LOS changed minimally. There was no appreciable change in the rate of in-hospital mortality (< 3%), but discharges home with home health care and to skilled rehabilitation or nursing facilities increased slightly. In the SCI group, hospitalizations and charges increased by 29 and 38%, respectively. There were no significant changes in LOS or discharge status in this group. Spinal cord injury was associated with increases in LOS, charges, and adverse outcomes compared with fractures without SCI. Total national charges associated with both groups combined exceeded $1.3 billion US in 2006. CONCLUSIONS During the studied period, increases in hospitalizations and charges were observed in both the SCI and non-SCI groups. The percentage increase was higher in the non-SCI group. Although SCI was associated with higher adverse outcomes, there were no significant improvements in immediate discharge status in either group during the 10 years analyzed.},

  Abstract                 = {Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) continues to be one of the leading causes of death and disability in the pediatric population. Although the literature on neurocognitive outcomes is relatively rich, studies vary significantly in the methods used to group subjects on several moderating variables, including age at injury, injury severity, and time since injury, making it difficult to combine and summarize the data for comparison. Further complicating this effort is the wide range of measures used to document functional outcomes in key neurocognitive domains. In this meta-analytic review, 28 publications (1988 to 2007) that met inclusion criteria were summarized based on three distinct injury severity and time post injury groups for 14 key neurocognitive domains. Effect sizes were calculated to reflect the extent to which the above groups differed in case-control and case-case studies, as well as address recovery based on longitudinal studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published quantitative summary of the literature on neurocognitive outcomes after pediatric TBI. Limitations of the current state of the literature as well as recommendations for future studies are discussed.},

Few studies in children have been reported, and none have used apparent diffusion coefficient maps to predict long-term (>1 year) neurocognitive outcomes. In this study, pooled regional and total brain diffusion coefficients were used to predict long-term outcomes in 17 pediatric brain injury patients. Apparent diffusion coefficient values were grouped into peripheral and deep gray and white matter, posterior fossa, and total brain. Regions of interest excluded areas that appeared abnormal on T(2)-weighted images. Apparent diffusion coefficient values from peripheral regions were inversely correlated with cognitive functioning. No significant correlations were apparent between the cognitive scores and apparent diffusion coefficient values for deep tissue or the posterior fossa. Regression analyses suggested that combined peripheral gray and white matter apparent diffusion coefficients explained 42% of the variance in the combined neurocognitive index. Peripheral gray diffusion coefficients alone explained an additional 20% of variance after accounting for clinical variables. These results suggest that obtaining apparent diffusion coefficient values, specifically from peripheral brain regions, may predict long-term outcome after pediatric brain injury. Discrepancies in the literature on this topic, as well as possible explanations, including sampling and clinical considerations, are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: An analysis is made of the characteristics of patients younger than 14 years treated in an adult ICU (AICU), to determine the procedures and techniques required by such patients, and to evaluate the use of the Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) in stratifying severity. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study was carried out. SETTING: An AICU of a second level hospital. PATIENTS: We studied 130 patients aged from 1 month to 14 years (average age 6.1+/-4 years) treated in the AICU from January 1997 to December 2010. VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Clinical-demographic parameters, diagnosis, clinical procedures, PIM score, length of stay, transfer to pediatric ICU (PICU), and mortality. Classification by destination (AICU, PICU) and outcome (alive, dead). PIM and assessment of the diagnostic performance curve (ROC) for mortality. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 6.1+/-4 years. Most common diagnoses: trauma (26.9%) and sepsis (22.3%). Main procedures: mechanical ventilation (58.5%), central venous line (74.6%) and vasoactive drugs (20%). A total of 64.6% were transferred to PICU, and the overall mortality was 13%. Patients who stayed in the AICU were older (8.2+/-4 vs 5.5+/-4 years, p<0.001), had low morbidity, and their stay was short (44.5+/-38 hours). The PIM score was significantly higher in the patients who died (60+/-20 AICU, 38+/-30 PICU) than in those who survived (4+/-1 AICU, 9+/-1 PICU) (p<0.001). ROC curve with AUC=0.91 (95%CI: 0.85 to 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: The PIM score can stratify severity and identify patients at an increased risk of death. Critical child care in the AICU requires the presence of adequate materials and the continuous learning of procedures adapted to pediatric patients in order to ensure adequate care.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To describe common associated symptoms within the 10 days before diagnosis in subjects enrolled in the Pediatric Heart Network's trial of steroid therapy in Kawasaki disease (KD). STUDY DESIGN: Patients with acute KD were enrolled between days 4 and 10 of illness at 8 centers between 2002 and 2004. We defined common associated symptoms as those occurring in >or=10% of patients. Principal clinical criteria for KD were not included in this analysis. RESULTS: Among 198 patients, irritability was reported in 98 (50%), vomiting in 88 (44%), decreased food/fluid intake in 73 (37%), cough in 55 (28%), diarrhea in 52 (26%), rhinorrhea in 37 (19%), weakness in 37 (19%), abdominal pain in 35 (18%), and joint pain (arthralgia or arthritis) in 29 (15%). One or more gastrointestinal symptom (vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain) was present in 120 patients (61%) and 69 patients (35%) had >or= 1 respiratory symptom (rhinorrhea or cough). CONCLUSIONS: Nonspecific symptoms occur commonly in children with KD. To reduce delays in diagnosis, clinicians should be educated that such symptoms may comprise a significant component in the chief complaint.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: We compare the predictive accuracy of emergency physicians' unstructured clinical judgment to the Canadian C-Spine rule. METHODS: This prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted at 10 Canadian urban academic emergency departments. Included in the study were alert, stable, adult patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 and trauma to the head or neck. This was a substudy of the Canadian C-Spine and CT Head Study. Eligible patients were prospectively evaluated before radiography. Physicians estimated the probability of unstable cervical spine injury from 0% to 100% according to clinical judgment alone and filled out a data form. Interobserver assessments were done when feasible. Patients underwent cervical spine radiography or follow-up to determine clinically important cervical spine injuries. Analyses included comparison of areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the kappa coefficient. RESULTS: During 18 months, 6265 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 36.6 years (range 16 to 97 years), and 50.1% were men. Sixty-four (1%) patients had a clinically important injury. The physicians' kappa for a 0% predicted probability of injury was 0.46 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.65). The respective areas under the ROC curve for predicting cervical spine injury were 0.85 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.89) for physician judgment and 0.91 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.92) for the Canadian C-Spine rule (P <.05). With a threshold of 0% predicted probability of injury, the respective indices of accuracy for physicians and the Canadian C-Spine rule were sensitivity 92.2% versus 100% (P <.001) and specificity 53.9% versus 44.0% (P <.001). CONCLUSION: Interobserver agreement of unstructured clinical judgment for predicting clinically important cervical spine injury is only fair, and the sensitivity is unacceptably low. The Canadian C-Spine rule was better at detecting clinically important injuries with a sensitivity of 100%. Prospective validation has recently been completed and should permit widespread use of the Canadian C-Spine rule.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: The Barell body region by nature of injury diagnosis matrix standardizes data selection and reports, using a two dimensional array (matrix) that includes all International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9-CM codes describing trauma. AIM: To provide a standard format for reports from trauma registries, hospital discharge data systems, emergency department data systems, or other sources of non-fatal injury data. This tool could also be used to characterize the patterns of injury using a manageable number of clinically meaningful diagnostic categories and to serve as a standard for casemix comparison across time and place. CONCEPT: The matrix displays 12 nature of injury columns and 36 body region rows placing each ICD-9-CM code in the range from 800 to 995 in a unique cell location in the matrix. Each cell includes the codes associated with a given injury. The matrix rows and columns can easily be collapsed to get broader groupings or expanded if more specific sites are required. The current matrix offers three standard levels of detail through predefined collapsing of body regions from 36 rows to nine rows to five rows. MATRIX DEVELOPMENT: This paper presents stages in the development and the major concepts and properties of the matrix, using data from the Israeli national trauma registry, and from the US National Hospital Discharge Survey. The matrix introduces new ideas such as the separation of traumatic brain injury (TBI), into three types. Injuries to the eye have been separated from other facial injuries. Other head injuries such as open wounds and burns were categorized separately. Injuries to the spinal cord and spinal column were also separated as are the abdomen and pelvis. Extremities have been divided into upper and lower with a further subdivision into more specific regions. Hip fractures were separated from other lower extremity fractures. FORTHCOMING DEVELOPMENTS: The matrix will be used for the development of standard methods for the analysis of multiple injuries and the creation of patient injury profiles. To meet the growing use of ICD-10 and to be applicable to a wider range of countries, the matrix will be translated to ICD-10 and eventually to ICD-10-CM. CONCLUSION: The Barell injury diagnosis matrix has the potential to serve as a basic tool in epidemiological and clinical analyses of injury data.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of a culturally tailored, family-centered, short-term behavioral intervention on BMI in Latino-American preschool-aged children. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 54 parent-child dyads were allocated to the intervention and 52 dyads were allocated to an alternative school-readiness program as the control condition. Parent-child dyads were eligible if the parent self-defined Latino, was at least 18 years old, had a 2- to 6-year-old child not currently enrolled in another healthy lifestyle program, had a valid telephone number, and planned on remaining in the city for the next 6 months. The Salud Con La Familia (Health with the Family) program consisted of 12 weekly 90-minute skills-building sessions designed to improve family nutritional habits and increase physical activity. Both programs were conducted in a community recreation center serving an urban neighborhood of mostly Spanish-speaking residents. RESULTS: Forty-two percent of participating preschool-aged children were overweight or obese. Controlling for child age, gender, and baseline BMI, the effect of the treatment condition on postintervention absolute BMI was B = -0.59 (P < .001). The intervention effect seemed to be strongest for obese children. CONCLUSIONS: A skills-building, culturally tailored intervention involving parent-child dyads changed short-term early growth patterns in these Latino-American preschool-aged children. Examining long-term effects would be a prudent next step.},

All children with NAHI admitted to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, since 1981 were identified. The characteristics of EPTS, EEG, and outcome were noted. Forty-four cases were identified. The average age of children at presentation was 5.9 months. Thirty-two of these children had EPTS. The median length of follow-up was 3 years. The mortality rate was six in 44 (14\%). The neurodevelopmental outcome correlated significantly with the presence and severity of EPTS (Tau=0.317,p=0.017). Of survivors, 22\% developed late posttraumatic epilepsy; the outcome in those with epilepsy was significantly worse than those without (p<0.0001).

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to aid failed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in children is associated with a high incidence of neurologic injury. We sought to identify risk factors for acute neurologic injury in children undergoing ECMO to aid CPR (E-CPR). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using data reported to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry. SETTING: Multi-institutional data. PATIENTS: Patients <18 years of age undergoing E-CPR during 1992-2005. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We defined acute neurologic injury as the occurrence of brain death, brain infarction, or intracranial hemorrhage identified by ultrasound or computerized tomography imaging. Of 682 E-CPR patients, 147 (22%) patients had acute neurologic injury. Brain death occurred in 74 (11%), cerebral infarction in 45 (7%), and intracranial hemorrhage in 45 (7%). The in-hospital mortality rate in patients with acute neurologic injury was 89%. In a multivariable logistic regression model, pre-ECMO factors including cardiac disease (odds ratio [OR] 0.46 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.28-0.76]) and pre-ECMO blood pH > or =6.865 (> or =6.865-7.120; OR 0.49 [95% CI 0.25-0.94]; pH >7.120; OR 0.47 [95% CI 0.26-0.85]) compared with pH <6.865 were associated with decreased odds of neurologic injury. During ECMO, neurologic injury was associated with ECMO complications including pulmonary hemorrhage (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.1-3.4), dialysis use (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.4-4.0), and CPR during ECMO support (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.6-3.8). CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic injury is a frequent complication in children undergoing E-CPR. Children with cardiac disease, less severe metabolic acidosis before ECMO, and an uncomplicated ECMO course have decreased odds of sustaining neurologic injury. Providing effective CPR and inclusion of brain protective therapies on ECMO should be considered in the future to improve neurologic outcomes for patients undergoing E-CPR.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: C-reactive protein (CRP), predicts coronary heart disease incidence in healthy subjects and has been associated with decreased endothelium-dependent relaxation, a potential risk factor for hypertension. However, the relationship between CRP and hypertension has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether circulating levels of CRP are independently related to essential hypertension. DESIGN: Cross-sectional population survey. We measured circulating levels of CRP, blood pressure and cardiovascular risk factors among participants. Binomial regression was used to calculate the adjusted effect of CRP on the prevalence of hypertension. SETTING: General community of Bucaramanga, Colombia. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 300 subjects > or = 30 years old. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Arterial blood pressure. RESULTS: Overall hypertension prevalence was 46.0%. The unadjusted prevalence of hypertension was 58.7% in the highest quartile of CRP, but only 34.7% in the lowest quartile. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, family history of hypertension, fasting glycemia, sedentary behaviour, and alcohol consumption, the prevalence of hypertension was 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.82, 1.58; P= 0.442], 1.36 (95% CI, 0.99, 1.87; P= 0.057) and 1.56 (95% CI, 1.14, 2.13; P = 0.005) times higher in subjects in the second, third and fourth quartiles of CRP, as compared to subjects in the first quartile. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest, for the first time, that CRP level may be an independent risk factor for the development of hypertension. However, because of the cross-sectional nature of our study, this finding should be confirmed in prospective cohort studies, aimed at elucidating the role of CRP in the prediction, diagnosis and management of hypertension.},

  Abstract                 = {Nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in both secondary damage and recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Transfer of NO groups to cysteine sulfhydryls on proteins produces S-nitrosothiols (RSNO). S-nitrosothiols may be neuroprotective after TBI by nitrosylation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and caspases. S-nitrosothiols release NO on decomposition for which endogenous reductants (i.e., ascorbate) are essential, and ascorbate is depleted in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after pediatric TBI. This study examined the presence and decomposition of RSNO in CSF and the association between CSF RSNO level and physiologic parameters after severe TBI. Cerebrospinal fluid samples (n = 72) were obtained from 18 infants and children on days 1 to 3 after severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score < 8) and 18 controls. Cerebrospinal fluid RSNO levels assessed by fluorometric assay peaked on day 3 versus control (1.42 +/- 0.11 micromol/L vs. 0.86 +/- 0.04, P< 0.05). S-nitrosoalbumin levels were also higher after TBI (n = 8, 0.99 +/- 0.09 micromol/L on day 3 vs. n = 6, 0.42 +/- 0.02 in controls, P< 0.05). S-nitrosoalbumin decomposition was decreased after TBI. Multivariate analysis showed an inverse relation between CSF RSNO and intracranial pressure and a direct relation with barbiturate treatment. Using a novel assay, the presence of RSNO and S-nitrosoalbumin in human CSF, an approximately 1.7-fold increase after TBI, and an association with low intracranial pressure are reported, supporting a possible neuroprotective role for RSNO. The increase in RSNO may result from increased NO production and/or decreased RSNO decomposition.},

  Abstract                 = {The long-term outcome for a child who has sustained a traumatic brain injury must be viewed in the context of ongoing development and maturation. Although neuronal plasticity provides the potential for neuronal reorganization in a child's brain, it is the behavioral demands of the environment that allow the child to take advantage of this potential and to maximize recovery. Pediatric rehabilitation is the setting that provides the necessary experiences for stimulating neuronal reorganization following TBI. However, neuronal reorganization has a cost to long-term development. The ultimate long-term impact of a TBI sustained in childhood depends on the child's ability to achieve developmental milestones following injury. Although injury-related and treatment-related factors are critical during the early stages of recovery, patient-related factors such as age-at-injury, developmental achievement at time of injury, maturation, and family involvement and resources impact the later stages of recovery. The process of pediatric rehabilitation following TBI is to provide an enriched, stimulating environment tailored to the needs of the child and based on real-word experiences. Early in the recovery process, pediatric rehabilitation is the setting that maximizes the potential for neuronal reorganization. Early rehabilitation also prepares the family for the child's long-term recovery and developmental needs. Involvement and training of family members early in the recovery process is critical for successful long-term outcome. Family members are the individuals best equipped to ensure treatment compliance and follow through with treatment recommendations, in maintaining treatment gains, and in generalizing treatment effects beyond the medical settings. Despite the life-long ramifications of childhood TBI, pediatric rehabilitation is the necessary step in promoting recovery and successful long-term outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and its most recent revision, the GOS-Extended (GOS-E), provide the gold standard for measuring traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcome. The GOS-E exhibits validity when used with adults and some adolescents, but validity with younger children is not established. Because the GOS-E lacks the developmental specificity necessary to evaluate children, toddlers, and infants, we modified the original version to create the GOS-E Pediatric Revision (GOS-E Peds), a developmentally appropriate structured interview, to classify younger patients. The criterion, predictive, and discriminant validity of the GOS-E Peds was measured in 159 subjects following TBI (mild: 36%; moderate: 12%; severe: 50%) at 3 and 6 months after injury. Participants were included from two studies completed at the Pediatric Neurotrauma Center at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. We assessed the relationship among GOS-E Peds, the GOS, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales as well as other standardized measures of functional, behavioral, intellectual, and neuropsychological outcome. Premorbid function was assessed 24-36 h after injury. The GOS-E Peds showed a strong correlation with the GOS at 3 and 6 month time points. Criterion-related validity was also indicated by GOS-E Peds' association with most measures at both time points and at injury severity levels. The 3 month GOS-E Peds was associated with the 6 month GOS-E Peds, everyday function, behavior, and most cognitive abilities. Discriminant validity is suggested by weak correlations between both 3 and 6 month GOS-E Peds and premorbid measures. The GOS-E Peds is sensitive to severity of injury and is associated with changes in TBI sequelae over time. This pediatric revision provides a valid outcome measure in infants, toddlers, children, and adolescents through age 16. Findings support using the GOS-E Peds as the primary outcome variable in pediatric clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a well described, but purportedly uncommon manifestation of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA). There is evidence to suggest that macrophage activation is integral to the pathogenesis of SJIA. Accordingly, many patients with SJIA may have evidence of mild MAS that is not appreciated clinically. We investigated the prevalence of occult MAS in children with SJIA by reviewing bone marrow aspirates (BMA). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with SJIA who underwent bone marrow aspiration were identified retrospectively. Patients admitted with a diagnosis of fever of unknown origin and discharged with a diagnosis other than SJIA or malignancy, and who had a BMA, were identified as controls. The BMA were reviewed by a single hematopathologist for evidence of MAS, ranging from activated macrophages to frank hemophagocytic cells. RESULTS: Eight of 15 (53%) patients with SJIA had BMA suggestive of MAS. Two of 15 patients (13%) were diagnosed clinically with MAS. Three patients (20%) were noted to have frank hemophagocytosis, only one of whom was diagnosed with MAS clinically. There were no statistically significant differences in the laboratory values for the patients with and without evidence of MAS on BMA. There was no evidence of increased macrophage activity or hemophagocytosis in any of the control BMA. CONCLUSION: Occult MAS appears to be common in patients with SJIA who undergo BMA. This suggests that macrophage activation may be integral to the pathogenesis of SJIA, with implications for treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {A technique to diagnose subependymal hemorrhage (SEH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), intracerebral hemorrhage, and posthemorrhage hydrocephalus in tiny infants, using real time ultrasound studies of the brain ventricular system, is described. This is a bedside technique that visualizes the brain through the fontanelles and the sutures, in three planes: coronal, sagittal, and horizontal. Excellent visualization of the ventricular system, caudate nuclei, the thalamus, the choroid plexus, the corpus callosum, and the foramen of Monro is obtained. This method has good definition using high frequency transducers since there is no bone interference. The ultrasound diagnosis correlated well with computed tomography (CT) and with direct pathologic studies. This technique was more sensitive in diagnosing small IVH/SEH and organized clots than were CT studies. IVH/SEH were found in 90% of 113 infants less than or equal to 34 weeks of gestation; 49% of the hemorrhages were large and 41% were small. Most hemorrhages were found in the first scan, usually shortly after birth. Twenty-one premature infants who never had perinatal asphyxia or respiratory distress syndrome had IVH/SEH. The hemorrhages were followed until disappearance, usually in one to three months in cases of large hemorrhages.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective. To determine whether systemic corticosteroids are under-prescribed (as measured by current NIH treatment guidelines) for children in the United States seen in the emergency department (ED) for acute asthma, and to identify factors associated with prescribing systemic corticosteroids. Methods. We used data from the 2001-2007 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. The study population was children </=18 years old in the ED with a primary diagnosis of asthma (ICD-9-CM code 493.xx) who received bronchodilator(s). The primary outcome was receipt of a systemic corticosteroid in the ED. Independent variables included patient-level (e.g., demographics, insurance, fever, admission), physician-level (provider type, ancillary medications and tests ordered), and system-level factors (e.g., ED type, geographic location, time of day, season, year). We used multivariable logistic regression techniques to identify factors associated with systemic corticosteroid treatment. Results. Systemic corticosteroids were prescribed at only 63% of pediatric acute asthma visits to EDs. Over the study period, there was a trend toward increasing systemic corticosteroid use (p for trend = .05). After adjusting for potential confounders, patients were more likely to receive systemic corticosteroids when treated in pediatric EDs than in general EDs (OR = 2.45; 95% CI: 1.26-4.77).Conclusion. Systemic corticosteroids are under-prescribed for children who present to EDs with acute asthma exacerbations. Pediatric EDs are more likely than general EDs to treat asthma exacerbations with systemic corticosteroids. Differences in the process of care in pediatric ED settings (compared to general EDs) may increase the likelihood of adherence to NIH treatment guidelines.},

  Abstract                 = {Moderate cerebral hypothermia is consistently neuroprotective after experimental hypoxia-ischemia; however, its mechanisms remain poorly defined. Using a model of complete umbilical cord occlusion for 25 min in 0.7 gestation fetal sheep, we examined the effects of cerebral hypothermia (fetal extradural temperature reduced from 39.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C to <34 degrees C; mean +/- SD), from 90 min to 70 h after the end of the insult, on postocclusion epileptiform activity. In the first 6 h after the end of occlusion, fetal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was abnormal with a mixture of fast and slow epileptiform transients superimposed on a suppressed background; seizures started a mean of 8 h after occlusion. There was a close correlation between numbers of these EEG transients and subsequent neuronal loss in the striatum after 3 days recovery (r(2) = 0.65, P = 0.008). Hypothermia was associated with a marked reduction in numbers of epileptiform transients in the first 6 h, reduced amplitude of seizures, and reduced striatal neuronal loss. In conclusion, neuroprotection with delayed, prolonged head cooling after a severe asphyxial insult in the preterm fetus was associated with potent, specific suppression of epileptiform transients in the early recovery phase but not of numbers of delayed seizures.},

  Abstract                 = {Prolonged, moderate cerebral hypothermia is consistently neuroprotective after experimental hypoxia-ischaemia; however, it has not been tested in the preterm brain. Preterm (0.7 gestation) fetal sheep received complete umbilical cord occlusion for 25 min followed by cerebral hypothermia (fetal extradural temperature reduced from 39.4 +/- 0.3 to 29.5 +/- 2.6 degrees C) from 90 min to 70 h after the end of occlusion or sham cooling. Occlusion led to severe acidosis and profound hypotension, which recovered rapidly after release of occlusion. After 3 days recovery the EEG spectral frequency, but not total intensity, was increased in the hypothermia-occlusion group compared with normothermia-occlusion. Hypothermia was associated with a significant overall reduction in loss of immature oligodendrocytes in the periventricular white matter (P < 0.001), and neuronal loss in the hippocampus and basal ganglia (P < 0.001), with suppression of activated caspase-3 and microglia (isolectin-B4 positive). Proliferation was significantly reduced in periventricular white matter after occlusion (P < 0.05), but not improved after hypothermia. In conclusion, delayed, prolonged head cooling after a profound hypoxic insult in the preterm fetus was associated with a significant reduction in loss of neurons and immature oligodendroglia, with evidence of EEG and haemodynamic improvement after 3 days recovery, but also with a persisting reduction in proliferation of cells in the periventricular region. Further studies are required to evaluate the long-term impact of cooling on brain growth and maturation.},

Participants were children (younger than 18 y) with TBI who were evaluated in the emergency department, admitted to the hospital, and received a head CT scan on the day of admission. The primary outcome measures were cervical spine imaging studies. This study was exempted from institutional review board assessment.A total of 30,112 children met study criteria. Overall, 52\% (15,687/30,112) received cervical spine imaging. The use of cervical spine radiographs alone decreased between 2001 (47\%) and 2011 (23\%), with an annual decrease of 2.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.1\%-3.3\%), and was largely replaced by an increased use of CT, with or without radiographs (8.6\% in 2001 and 19.5\% in 2011, with an annual increase of 0.9\%; 95\% CI, 0.1\%-1.8\%). A total of 2545 children received cervical spine CT despite being discharged alive from the hospital in less than 72 hours, and 1655 of those had a low-risk mechanism of injury.The adoption of CT clearance of the cervical spine in adults seems to have influenced the care of children with TBI, despite concerns about radiation exposure.},

  Abstract                 = {Record linkage may create powerful datasets with which investigators can conduct comparative effectiveness studies evaluating the impact of tests or interventions on health. All linkages of health care data files to date have used protected health information (PHI) in their linkage variables. A technique to link datasets without using PHI would be advantageous both to preserve privacy and to increase the number of potential linkages.We applied probabilistic linkage to records of injured children in the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB, N = 156,357) and the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS, N = 104,049) databases from 2007 to 2010. 49 match variables without PHI were used, many of them administrative variables and indicators for procedures recorded as International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification codes. We validated the accuracy of the linkage using identified data from a single center that submits to both databases.We accurately linked the PHIS and NTDB records for 69\% of children with any injury, and 88\% of those with severe traumatic brain injury eligible for a study of intervention effectiveness (positive predictive value of 98\%, specificity of 99.99\%). Accurate linkage was associated with longer lengths of stay, more severe injuries, and multiple injuries.In populations with substantial illness or injury severity, accurate record linkage may be possible in the absence of PHI.

  Abstract                 = {To describe patient demographics, interventions, and outcomes in hospitalized children with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) complicating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).We performed a retrospective cohort study using data recorded in the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database from October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2010. Participants had International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes for MAS and either SLE or JIA. The primary outcome was hospital mortality (for the index admission). Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admission, critical care interventions, and medication use.A total of 121 children at 28 children's hospitals met the inclusion criteria, including 19 children with SLE and 102 children with JIA. The index admission mortality rate was 7\% (8 of 121 patients). ICU admission (33\%), mechanical ventilation (26\%), and inotrope/vasopressor therapy (26\%) were common. Compared to children with JIA, those with SLE had a similar mortality rate (6\% versus 11\%, respectively; exact P = 0.6). More patients with SLE than those with JIA received ICU care (63\% versus 27\%; P = 0.002), received mechanical ventilation (53\% versus 21\%; P = 0.003), and had cardiovascular dysfunction (47\% versus 23\% received inotrope/vasopressor therapy; P = 0.02). Children with SLE and those with JIA received cyclosporine at similar rates, but more children with SLE received cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil, and more children with JIA received interleukin-1 antagonists.Organ system dysfunction is common in children with rheumatic diseases complicated by MAS, and more organ system support is required in children with underlying SLE than in children with JIA. Current treatment of pediatric MAS varies based on the underlying rheumatic disease.},

MAIN ANALYSIS: Cox regression.The predictor of interest was the patient-specific peak serum ferritin level, dichotomized a priori at 3000 ng/mL. The outcomes were mortality and intensive care unit admission. A total of 171 patients met the inclusion criteria. The observation time without death or intensive care unit admission ranged from 184 to 1621 days. The hazard ratio of death with peak ferritin of >3000 ng/mL was 4.32 (95\% confidence interval 2.21-8.47, p < .001) compared to peak ferritin of 1000-3000 ng/mL. The hazard ratio of intensive care unit admission with peak ferritin of >3000 ng/mL was 2.49 (95\% confidence interval 1.53-4.05, p < .001) compared to peak ferritin of 1000-3000 ng/mL. Both estimates were adjusted for bone marrow transplant, solid organ transplant, hemoglobinopathy, and existing rheumatologic disease.In this pediatric population, with serum ferritin levels of >3000 ng/mL, there was increased risk for both receipt of critical care and subsequent death.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The mechanism, crash characteristics, and spectrum of lower extremity injuries in children restrained in forward-facing car seats during front and rear impacts have not been described. METHODS: We identified in two databases children who sustained lower extremity injuries while restrained in forward-facing car seats. To identify the mechanism, we analyzed crash reconstructions from three frontal-impact cases from the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network. To further describe the crash and injury characteristics we evaluated children between 1 and 4 years of age with lower extremity injuries from front or rear impacts in the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) database. RESULTS: Crash reconstruction data demonstrated that the likely mechanism of lower extremity injury was contact between the legs and the front seatbacks. In the CDS database, we identified 15 children with lower extremity injuries in a forward-facing child seat, usually (13 out of 15) placed in the rear seat, incurred in frontal impacts (11 out of 15). Several (5 out of 15) children were in unbelted or improperly secured forward-facing car seats. Injury Severity Scores varied widely (5-50). CONCLUSIONS: Children in forward-facing car seats involved in severe front or rear crashes may incur a range of lower extremity injury from impact with the car interior component in front of them. Crash scene photography can provide useful information about anatomic sites at risk for injury and alert emergency department providers to possible subtle injury.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to determine the effect of birth hospital pediatric cardiac specialty center status and neonatal level of care on 90-day mortality for infants with ductal-dependent congenital heart disease. METHODS: A population-based, retrospective, cohort study was conducted in Washington State in 1987-2006. All infants born in Washington with gestational ages of >/=32 weeks and birth weights of >/=1500 g who were admitted to a Washington hospital for the care of a congenital cardiac anomaly likely to be ductal dependent were included. Subjects were required to receive a surgical or interventional cardiac procedure within 30 days after birth. Birth certificate data were linked with death certificate data and hospital administrative records. The exposures of interest were birth hospital pediatric cardiac specialty center status and neonatal level of care. The primary outcome was death within 90 days. RESULTS: A total of 823 infants met the inclusion criteria, 285 born at specialty centers and 538 at other centers. After adjustment for cardiac diagnoses, other congenital anomalies, birth year, maternal income quartile, and definitive-care hospital, there was no significant difference in 90-day mortality for infants born at specialty centers versus other centers (odds ratio: 1.05 [95% confidence interval: 0.65-1.68]). CONCLUSION: For infants with ductal-dependent congenital heart disease, there was no difference in 90-day mortality for infants born at specialty centers versus other centers in the state of Washington.},

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database (January 2001-June 2011). PARTICIPANTS: Children (age <18y) with TBI (N=21,399) who were admitted to the intensive care unit and survived to hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PT or OT evaluation and speech or swallow therapy evaluation. A propensity score was calculated to allow comparison of expected with observed rates of therapy evaluations by the hospital. RESULTS: The median hospital length of stay was 5 days (interquartile range, 3-10d). Overall, 8748 (41%) of 21,399 children received either a PT or OT evaluation, and 5490 (26%) out of 21,399 children received either a speech or swallow evaluation. Older children and those with higher energy injury mechanisms, more severe injuries, extremity fractures, more treatment with neuromuscular blocking agents or pentobarbital, and admission to a hospital with an American College of Surgeons Level I pediatric trauma designation were more likely to receive therapy evaluations. The median time until the first therapy evaluation was 5 (PT or OT) and 7 days (speech or swallow). Expected hospital evaluation rates were 25% to 54% (PT or OT) and 16% to 35% (speech or swallow), while observed hospital evaluation rates were 11% to 74% (PT or OT) and 4% to 55% (speech or swallow). CONCLUSIONS: There is wide between-hospital variation in provision of rehabilitation therapies for children with TBI. Evidence-based criteria for initiation of routine therapy evaluations after TBI are needed.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To describe between-hospital and patient-level variation in intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and to evaluate ICP monitoring in association with hospital features and outcome in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database (January 2001 to June 2011). PARTICIPANTS: Children (aged <18 years) with TBI and head Abbreviated Injury Scale scores of at least 3 who were ventilated for at least 96 consecutive hours or who died in the first 4 days after hospital admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Monitoring of ICP. RESULTS: A total of 4667 children met the study criteria. Hospital mortality was 41% (n = 1919). Overall, 55% of patients (n = 2586) received ICP monitoring. Expected hospital ICP monitoring rates after adjustment for patient age, cardiac arrest, inflicted injury, craniotomy or craniectomy, head Abbreviated Injury Scale score, and Injury Severity Score were 47% to 60%. Observed hospital ICP monitoring rates were 14% to 83%. Hospitals with more observed ICP monitoring, relative to expected, and hospitals with higher patient volumes had lower rates of mortality or severe disability. After adjustment for between-hospital variation and patient severity of injury, ICP monitoring was independently associated with age 1 year and older (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.5-3.8) vs age younger than 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: There was significant between-hospital variation in ICP monitoring that cannot be attributed solely to differences in case mix. Hospitals that monitor ICP more frequently and hospitals with higher patient volumes had better patient outcomes. Infants with TBI are less likely to receive ICP monitoring than are older children.},

  Abstract                 = {Our objectives were to review and categorize the existing data sources that are important to pediatric critical care medicine (PCCM) investigators and the types of questions that have been or could be studied with each data source. We conducted a narrative review of the medical literature, categorized the data sources available to PCCM investigators, and created an online data source registry. We found that many data sources are available for research in PCCM. To date, PCCM investigators have most often relied on pediatric critical care registries and treatment- or disease-specific registries. The available data sources vary widely in the level of clinical detail and the types of questions they can reliably answer. Linkage of data sources can expand the types of questions that a data source can be used to study. Careful matching of the scientific question to the best available data source or linked data sources is necessary. In addition, rigorous application of the best available analysis techniques and reporting consistent with observational research standards will maximize the quality of research using existing data in PCCM.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To describe patterns of use for mannitol and hypertonic saline in children with traumatic brain injury, to evaluate any potential associations between hypertonic saline and mannitol use and patient demographic, injury, and treatment hospital characteristics, and to determine whether the 2003 guidelines for severe pediatric traumatic brain injury impacted clinical practice regarding osmolar therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Pediatric Health Information System database, January, 2001 to December, 2008. PATIENTS: Children (age <18 yrs) with traumatic brain injury and head/neck Abbreviated Injury Scale score >/= 3 who received mechanical ventilation and intensive care. INTERVENTIONS: : None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was hospital billing for parenteral hypertonic saline and mannitol use, by day of service. Overall, 33% (2,069 of 6,238) of the patients received hypertonic saline, and 40% (2,500 of 6,238) received mannitol. Of the 1,854 patients who received hypertonic saline or mannitol for >/= 2 days in the first week of therapy, 29% did not have intracranial pressure monitoring. After adjustment for hospital-level variation, primary insurance payer, and overall injury severity, use of both drugs was independently associated with older patient age, intracranial hemorrhage (other than epidural), skull fracture, and higher head/neck injury severity. Hypertonic saline use increased and mannitol use decreased with publication of the 2003 guidelines, and these trends continued through 2008. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertonic saline and mannitol are used less in infants than in older children. The patient-level and hospital-level variation in osmolar therapy use and the substantial amount of sustained osmolar therapy without intracranial pressure monitoring suggest opportunities to improve the quality of pediatric traumatic brain injury care. With limited high-quality evidence available, published expert guidelines appear to significantly impact clinical practice in this area.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe the characteristics of pediatric discharges associated with long-term mechanical ventilation (LTMV) compared with those with complex chronic conditions (CCCs), and evaluate trends over time in health care utilization for the discharges associated with LTMV. METHODS: The Kids' Inpatient Database, compiled by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, was used. Routine newborn care was excluded. Discharges associated with LTMV were identified by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code v46.1x and compared with discharges associated with CCCs in 2006 using simple regression and chi(2) analyses. Trends in LTMV-associated discharges from 2000 to 2006 were assessed using variance-weighted least squares regression. RESULTS: In 2006, there were an estimated 7812 discharges associated with LTMV. Compared with discharges for children with CCCs, LTMV discharges had significantly higher mortality, longer lengths of stay, higher mean charges, more emergency department admissions, and more discharges to long-term care. From 2000 to 2006, there was a 55% increase in the number of LTMV discharges and a concurrent 70% increase in aggregate hospital charges. The majority of LTMV discharges occurred in children 4 years old and younger, and approximately 50% of the aggregate charges were for children younger than 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Discharges for children associated with LTMV require substantively greater inpatient resource use than other children with CCCs. As the number of discharges and associated aggregate charges increase over time, additional research must examine patterns of care for specific clinical subgroups of LTMV, especially children aged 4 years and younger.},

These results underline the link between individual conceptions and the nature of the practices being used, and they show the impact of training and experience acquired in the school setting with respect to various practices and the difficulties they encounter in the fulfillment of their objectives as school nurses. The specificity of the school nurse profession is not necessarily solely related to the provision of care, but rather it is more accurately articulated around a set of educational tasks and goals, without of course being in a competitive position with the educational disciplines. This radical change in the fundamental core of the professional mission underlies the need to define a new professionalism and develop specific training tailored to the school setting and its distinctive features.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Health insurers, physicians, and patients worldwide need information on the comparative effectiveness and safety of prescription drugs in routine care. Nonrandomized studies of treatment effects using secondary databases may supplement the evidence based from randomized clinical trials and prospective observational studies. Recognizing the challenges to conducting valid retrospective epidemiologic and health services research studies, a Task Force was formed to develop a guidance document on state of the art approaches to frame research questions and report findings for these studies. METHODS: The Task Force was commissioned and a Chair was selected by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Board of Directors in October 2007. This Report, the first of three reported in this issue of the journal, addressed issues of framing the research question and reporting and interpreting findings. RESULTS: The Task Force Report proposes four primary characteristics-relevance, specificity, novelty, and feasibility while defining the research question. Recommendations included: the practice of a priori specification of the research question; transparency of prespecified analytical plans, provision of justifications for any subsequent changes in analytical plan, and reporting the results of prespecified plans as well as results from significant modifications, structured abstracts to report findings with scientific neutrality; and reasoned interpretations of findings to help inform policy decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Comparative effectiveness research in the form of nonrandomized studies using secondary databases can be designed with rigorous elements and conducted with sophisticated statistical methods to improve causal inference of treatment effects. Standardized reporting and careful interpretation of results can aid policy and decision-making.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is usually preceded by colonisation of the respiratory tract. During outbreaks, colonisation with P aeruginosa is mainly derived from exogenous sources. The relative importance of different pathways of colonisation of P aeruginosa has rarely been determined in non-epidemic settings. METHODS: In order to determine the importance of exogenous colonisation, all isolates of P aeruginosa obtained by surveillance and clinical cultures from two identical intensive care units (ICUs) were genotyped with pulsed field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were studied, 44 in ICU 1 and 56 in ICU 2. Twenty three patients were colonised with P aeruginosa, seven at the start of the study or on admission and 16 of the remaining 93 patients became colonised during the study. Eight patients developed VAP due to P aeruginosa. The incidence of respiratory tract colonisation and VAP with P aeruginosa in our ICU was similar to that before and after the study period, and therefore represents an endemic situation. Genotyping of 118 isolates yielded 11 strain types: eight in one patient each, two in three patients each, and one type in eight patients. Based on chronological evaluation and genotypical identity of isolates, eight cases of cross-colonisation were identified. Eight (50%) of 16 episodes of acquired colonisation and two (25%) of eight cases of VAP due to P aeruginosa seemed to be the result of cross-colonisation. CONCLUSIONS: Even in non-epidemic settings cross-colonisation seems to play an important part in the epidemiology of colonisation and infection with P aeruginosa.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Drotrecogin alfa (activated), or recombinant human activated protein C, has antithrombotic, antiinflammatory, and profibrinolytic properties. In a previous study, drotrecogin alfa activated produced dose-dependent reductions in the levels of markers of coagulation and inflammation in patients with severe sepsis. In this phase 3 trial, we assessed whether treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated reduced the rate of death from any cause among patients with severe sepsis. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients with systemic inflammation and organ failure due to acute infection were enrolled and assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of either placebo or drotrecogin alfa activated (24 microg per kilogram of body weight per hour) for a total duration of 96 hours. The prospectively defined primary end point was death from any cause and was assessed 28 days after the start of the infusion. Patients were monitored for adverse events; changes in vital signs, laboratory variables, and the results of microbiologic cultures; and the development of neutralizing antibodies against activated protein C. RESULTS: A total of 1690 randomized patients were treated (840 in the placebo group and 850 in the drotrecogin alfa activated group). The mortality rate was 30.8 percent in the placebo group and 24.7 percent in the drotrecogin alfa activated group. On the basis of the prospectively defined primary analysis, treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated was associated with a reduction in the relative risk of death of 19.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.6 to 30.5) and an absolute reduction in the risk of death of 6.1 percent (P=0.005). The incidence of serious bleeding was higher in the drotrecogin alfa activated group than in the placebo group (3.5 percent vs. 2.0 percent, P=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated significantly reduces mortality in patients with severe sepsis and may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.},

  Abstract                 = {The objectives are to describe health outcomes and hospital resource use of children after tracheotomy and identify patient characteristics that correlate with outcomes and hospital resource use.A retrospective analysis of 917 children aged 0 to 18 years undergoing tracheotomy from 36 children's hospitals in 2002 with follow-up through 2007. Children were identified from ICD-9-CM tracheotomy procedure codes. Comorbid conditions (neurologic impairment [NI], chronic lung disease, upper airway anomaly, prematurity, and trauma) were identified with ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes. Patient characteristics were compared with in-hospital mortality, decannulation, and hospital resource use by using generalized estimating equations.Forty-eight percent of children were <or=6 months old at tracheotomy placement. Chronic lung disease (56\%), NI (48\%), and upper airway anomaly (47\%) were the most common underlying comorbid conditions. During hospitalization for tracheotomy placement, children with an upper airway anomaly experienced less mortality (3.3\% vs 11.7\%; P < .001) than children without an upper airway anomaly. Five years after tracheotomy, children with NI experienced greater mortality (8.8\% vs 3.5\%; P <or= .01), less decannulation (5.0\% vs 11.0\%; P <or= .01), and more total number of days in the hospital (mean [SE]: 39.5 [4.0] vs 25.6 [2.6] days; P <or= .01) than children without NI. These findings remained significant (P < .01) in multivariate analysis after controlling for other significant cofactors.Children with upper airway anomaly experienced less mortality, and children with NI experienced higher mortality rates and greater hospital resource use after tracheotomy. Additional research is needed to explore additional factors that may influence health outcomes in children with tracheotomy.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To identify children at risk for in-hospital mortality following tracheotomy. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 25 746 876 US hospitalisations for children within the Kids' Inpatient Database 1997, 2000, 2003 and 2006. PARTICIPANTS: 18 806 hospitalisations of children ages 0-18 years undergoing tracheotomy, identified from ICD-9-CM tracheotomy procedure codes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mortality during the initial hospitalisation when tracheotomy was performed in relation to patient demographic and clinical characteristics (neuromuscular impairment (NI), chronic lung disease, upper airway anomaly, prematurity, congenital heart disease, upper airway infection and trauma) identified with ICD-9-CM codes. RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2006, mortality following tracheotomy ranged from 7.7% to 8.5%. In each year, higher mortality was observed in children undergoing tracheotomy who were aged <1 year compared with children aged 1-4 years (mortality range: 10.2-13.1% vs 1.1-4.2%); in children with congenital heart disease, compared with children without congenital heart disease (13.1-18.7% vs 6.2-7.1%) and in children with prematurity, compared with children who were not premature (13.0-19.4% vs 6.8-7.3%). Lower mortality was observed in children with an upper airway anomaly compared with children without an upper airway anomaly (1.5-5.1% vs 9.1-10.3%). In 2006, the highest mortality (40.0%) was observed in premature children with NI and congenital heart disease, who did not have an upper airway anomaly. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital heart disease, prematurity, the absence of an upper airway anomaly and age <1 year were characteristics associated with higher mortality in children following tracheotomy. These findings may assist provider communication with children and families regarding early prognosis following tracheotomy.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Early hospital readmission is emerging as an indicator of care quality. Some children with chronic illnesses may be readmitted on a recurrent basis, but there are limited data describing their rehospitalization patterns and impact. OBJECTIVES: To describe the inpatient resource utilization, clinical characteristics, and admission reasons of patients recurrently readmitted to children's hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort analysis of 317,643 patients (n = 579,504 admissions) admitted to 37 US children's hospitals in 2003 with follow-up through 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Maximum number of readmissions experienced by each child within any 365-day interval during the 5-year follow-up period. RESULTS: In the sample, 69,294 patients (21.8%) experienced at least 1 readmission within 365 days of a prior admission. Within a 365-day interval, 9237 patients (2.9%) experienced 4 or more readmissions; time between admissions was a median 37 days (interquartile range [IQR], 21-63). These patients accounted for 18.8% (109,155 admissions) of all admissions and 23.2% ($3.4 billion) of total inpatient charges for the study cohort during the entire follow-up period. Tests for trend indicated that as the number of readmissions increased from 0 to 4 or more, the prevalences increased for a complex chronic condition (from 22.3% [n = 55,382/248,349] to 89.0% [n = 8225/9237]; P < .001), technology assistance (from 5.3% [n = 13,163] to 52.6% [n = 4859]; P < .001), public insurance use (from 40.9% [n = 101,575] to 56.3% [n = 5202]; P < .001), and non-Hispanic black race (from 21.8% [n = 54,140] to 34.4% [n = 3181]; P < .001); and the prevalence decreased for readmissions associated with an ambulatory care-sensitive condition (from 23.1% [62,847/272,065] to 14.0% [15,282/109,155], P < .001). Of patients readmitted 4 or more times in a 365-day interval, 2633 (28.5%) were rehospitalized for a problem in the same organ system across all admissions during the interval. CONCLUSIONS: Among a group of pediatric hospitals, 18.8% of admissions and 23.2% of inpatient charges were accounted for by the 2.9% of patients with frequent recurrent admissions. Many of these patients were rehospitalized recurrently for a problem in the same organ system.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To compare inpatient resource use trends for healthy children and children with chronic health conditions of varying degrees of medical complexity. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Twenty-eight US children's hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 1 526 051 unique patients hospitalized from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009, who were assigned to 1 of 5 chronic condition groups using 3M's Clinical Risk Group software. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trends in the number of patients, hospitalizations, hospital days, and charges analyzed with linear regression. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2009, hospitals experienced a greater increase in the number of children hospitalized with vs without a chronic condition (19.2% vs 13.7% cumulative increase, P < .001). The greatest cumulative increase (32.5%) was attributable to children with a significant chronic condition affecting 2 or more body systems, who accounted for 19.2% (n = 63 203) of patients, 27.2% (n = 111 685) of hospital discharges, 48.9% (n = 1.1 million) of hospital days, and 53.2% ($9.2 billion) of hospital charges in 2009. These children had a higher percentage of Medicaid use (56.5% vs 49.7%; P < .001) compared with children without a chronic condition. Cerebral palsy (9179 [14.6%]) and asthma (13 708 [21.8%]) were the most common primary diagnosis and comorbidity, respectively, observed among these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a chronic condition increasingly used more resources in a group of children's hospitals than patients without a chronic condition. The greatest growth was observed in hospitalized children with chronic conditions affecting 2 or more body systems. Children's hospitals must ensure that their inpatient care systems and payment structures are equipped to meet the protean needs of this important population of children.},

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort using the Kids' Inpatient Database 2003. SETTING: Discharges from 3438 hospitals in 36 states from 2003. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 0 to 18 years undergoing ventriculoseptal defect surgery (n = 2301), tracheotomy (n = 2674), ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement (n = 3378), and posterior spinal fusion (n = 4002). MAIN EXPOSURE: Hospital volume. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital mortality and postoperative complications. RESULTS: For tracheotomy and posterior spinal fusion, at least one fourth of the hospitals performed only 1 operation for children aged 0 to 18 years in 2003. For these same operations, at least half of hospitals treated 4 or fewer cases per year. For all operations, discharges from low-volume hospitals were less likely to be from children's or teaching hospitals compared with discharges from higher-volume hospitals. For tracheotomy, children were less likely to experience postoperative complications in high-volume hospitals compared with low-volume hospitals (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-1.09). CONCLUSIONS: Many children undergoing common pediatric specialty operations had these procedures performed in low-volume hospitals. Low-volume hospitals were less likely to be children's or teaching hospitals. Children undergoing tracheotomy experienced higher rates of complications in low-volume hospitals. Further research is needed to identify the reasons why so many children have these operations performed in low-volume hospitals.},

  Abstract                 = {Readmission rates are used as an indicator of the quality of care that patients receive during a hospital admission and after discharge.To determine the prevalence of pediatric readmissions and the magnitude of variation in pediatric readmission rates across hospitals.We analyzed 568,845 admissions at 72 children's hospitals between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010, in the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions Case Mix Comparative data set. We estimated hierarchical regression models for 30-day readmission rates by hospital, accounting for age and Chronic Condition Indicators. Hospitals with adjusted readmission rates that were 1 SD above and below the mean were defined as having "high" and "low" rates, respectively.Thirty-day unplanned readmissions following admission for any diagnosis and for the 10 admission diagnoses with the highest readmission prevalence. Planned readmissions were identified with procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification.The 30-day unadjusted readmission rate for all hospitalized children was 6.5\% (n = 36,734). Adjusted rates were 28.6\% greater in hospitals with high vs low readmission rates (7.2\% [95\% CI, 7.1\%-7.2\%] vs 5.6\% [95\% CI, 5.6\%-5.6\%]). For the 10 admission diagnoses with the highest readmission prevalence, the adjusted rates were 17.0\% to 66.0\% greater in hospitals with high vs low readmission rates. For example, sickle cell rates were 20.1\% (95\% CI, 20.0\%-20.3\%) vs 12.7\% (95\% CI, 12.6\%-12.8\%) in high vs low hospitals, respectively.Among patients admitted to acute care pediatric hospitals, the rate of unplanned readmissions at 30 days was 6.5\%. There was significant variability in readmission rates across conditions and hospitals. These data may be useful for hospitals' quality improvement efforts.},

  Abstract                 = {Residues 11 to 27 of the hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid antigen contain a cytotoxic T-cell epitope that is recognized by cytotoxic T cells from virtually all HLA-A2-positive patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection. Using panels of truncated and overlapping peptides, we now show that the optimal amino acid sequence recognized by cytotoxic T cells is a 10-mer (residues 18 to 27) containing the predicted peptide-binding motif for HLA-A2 and that this peptide can stimulate cytotoxic T cells able to recognize endogenously synthesized hepatitis B core antigen. Since patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection fail to mount an efficient cytotoxic T-cell response to it, this epitope might serve as the starting point for the design of synthetic peptide-based immunotherapeutic strategies to terminate persistent viral infection.},

  Abstract                 = {The control of unintended variation is an objective central to modern industrial quality management methods, based largely on the theoretical work of Walter A. Shewhart. As industrial quality management techniques find their place in health care, professionals may feel threatened by the effort to reduce variation. Understanding may reduce this fear. Variation of the types addressed in quality control efforts erodes quality and reliability, and adds unnecessarily to costs. Such undesirable variation derives, for example, from misinterpretation of random noise in clinical data, from unreliability in the performance of clinical and support systems intended to support care, from habitual differences in practice style that are not grounded in knowledge or reason, and from the failure to integrate care across the boundaries of components of the health care system. Quality management efforts can successfully reduce each of these forms of variation without insult to the professional autonomy, dignity, or purpose of health care professionals. Professionals need to embrace the scientific control of variation in the service of their patients and themselves.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Psychiatric conditions in which symptoms arise involuntarily ('diseases') might be assumed to be more heritable than those in which choices are essential (behavioral disorders). We sought to determine whether psychiatric 'diseases' (Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and mood and anxiety disorders) are more heritable than behavioral disorders (substance use disorders and anorexia nervosa). METHOD: We reviewed the literature for recent quantitative summaries of heritabilities. When these were unavailable, we calculated weighted mean heritabilities from twin studies meeting modern methological standards. RESULTS: Heritability summary estimates were as follows: bipolar disorder (85%), schizophrenia (81%), Alzheimer's disease (75%), cocaine use disorder (72%), anorexia nervosa (60%), alcohol dependence (56%), sedative use disorder (51%), cannabis use disorder (48%), panic disorder (43%), stimulant use disorder (40%), major depressive disorder (37%), and generalized anxiety disorder (28%). CONCLUSIONS: No systematic relationship exists between the disease-like character of a psychiatric disorder and its heritability; many behavioral disorders seem to be more heritable than conditions commonly construed as diseases. These results suggest an error in 'common-sense' assumptions about the etiology of psychiatric disorders. That is, among psychiatric disorders, there is no close relationship between the strength of genetic influences and the etiologic importance of volitional processes.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Macrophage activation syndrome is characterized by an overwhelming inflammatory reaction driven by excessive expansion of T cells and hemophagocytic macrophages. Levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha (sIL-2Ralpha) and soluble CD163 (sCD163) may reflect the degree of activation and expansion of T cells and macrophages, respectively. This study was undertaken to assess the value of serum sIL-2Ralpha and sCD163 in diagnosing acute macrophage activation syndrome complicating systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to assess sIL-2Ralpha and sCD163 levels in sera from 7 patients with acute macrophage activation syndrome complicating systemic JIA and 16 patients with untreated new-onset systemic JIA. The results were correlated with clinical features of established macrophage activation syndrome, including ferritin levels. RESULTS: The median level of sIL-2Ralpha in the patients with macrophage activation syndrome was 19,646 pg/ml (interquartile range [IQR] 18,128), compared with 3,787 pg/ml (IQR 3,762) in patients with systemic JIA (P = 0.003). Similarly, the median level of sCD163 in patients with macrophage activation syndrome was 23,000 ng/ml (IQR 14,191), compared with 5,480 ng/ml (IQR 2,635) in patients with systemic JIA (P = 0.017). In 5 of 16 patients with systemic JIA, serum levels of sIL-2Ralpha or sCD163 were comparable with those in patients with acute macrophage activation syndrome. These patients had high inflammatory activity associated with a trend toward lower hemoglobin levels (P = 0.11), lower platelet counts, and significantly higher ferritin levels (P = 0.02). Two of these 5 patients developed overt macrophage activation syndrome several months later. CONCLUSION: Levels of sIL-2Ralpha and sCD163 are promising diagnostic markers for macrophage activation syndrome. They may also help identify patients with subclinical macrophage activation syndrome.},

Semistructured interviews of the parent and child and standardized parent self-report rating instruments were used.Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and depressive disorders were the most common lifetime and novel diagnoses. A wide variety and high rate of novel psychiatric disorders were identified; 74\% of these disorders persisted in 48\% of the injured children. Internalizing disorders were more likely to resolve than externalizing disorders. Both interviews and parent ratings were sensitive to current externalizing behaviors; interviews more often detected internalizing disorders, whereas parent ratings also identified cognitive difficulties.Findings were generally consistent with previous research demonstrating the high rate of novel psychiatric disorders following pediatric TBI. Psychiatric interviews were sensitive in identifying both lifetime and novel disorders.},

The results showed decreased blood haemoglobin, serum iron, serum transferrin and transferrin saturation compared to an increase in serum ferritin levels. These results indicate that there is inadequate availability of iron to tissues (secondary to rearrangement of body iron to the advantage of the iron storage compartment), which is often present in severely critically ill patients. A positive correlation was found between the initial (ferritin) levels and SAPS (r = 0.41, p less than 0.01). In addition, the increase of ferritin concentration parallels a worsening of the clinical status in severely ill patients. This is due to enhanced release by the macrophage system. From this, we consider serum ferritin as an acute-phase protein and a useful marker of the severity of the clinical status. It appears to be useful in predicting the patient's outcome, but is not reliable in evaluating iron stores in stressed patients.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for antimicrobial therapy for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis. DESIGN: The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. METHODS: The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591. CONCLUSION: Since the prompt institution of therapy that is active against the causative pathogen is one of the most important predictors of outcome, clinicians must establish a system for rapid administration of a rationally chosen drug or combination of drugs when sepsis or septic shock is suspected. The expanding number of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral agents available provides opportunities for effective empiric and specific therapy. However, to minimize the promotion of antimicrobial resistance and cost and to maximize efficacy, detailed knowledge of the likely pathogens and the properties of the available drugs is necessary for the intensivist.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The Xpert MTB/RIF test (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) can detect tuberculosis and its multidrug-resistant form with very high sensitivity and specificity in controlled studies, but no performance data exist from district and subdistrict health facilities in tuberculosis-endemic countries. We aimed to assess operational feasibility, accuracy, and effectiveness of implementation in such settings. METHODS: We assessed adults (>/=18 years) with suspected tuberculosis or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis consecutively presenting with cough lasting at least 2 weeks to urban health centres in South Africa, Peru, and India, drug-resistance screening facilities in Azerbaijan and the Philippines, and an emergency room in Uganda. Patients were excluded from the main analyses if their second sputum sample was collected more than 1 week after the first sample, or if no valid reference standard or MTB/RIF test was available. We compared one-off direct MTB/RIF testing in nine microscopy laboratories adjacent to study sites with 2-3 sputum smears and 1-3 cultures, dependent on site, and drug-susceptibility testing. We assessed indicators of robustness including indeterminate rate and between-site performance, and compared time to detection, reporting, and treatment, and patient dropouts for the techniques used. FINDINGS: We enrolled 6648 participants between Aug 11, 2009, and June 26, 2010. One-off MTB/RIF testing detected 933 (90.3%) of 1033 culture-confirmed cases of tuberculosis, compared with 699 (67.1%) of 1041 for microscopy. MTB/RIF test sensitivity was 76.9% in smear-negative, culture-positive patients (296 of 385 samples), and 99.0% specific (2846 of 2876 non-tuberculosis samples). MTB/RIF test sensitivity for rifampicin resistance was 94.4% (236 of 250) and specificity was 98.3% (796 of 810). Unlike microscopy, MTB/RIF test sensitivity was not significantly lower in patients with HIV co-infection. Median time to detection of tuberculosis for the MTB/RIF test was 0 days (IQR 0-1), compared with 1 day (0-1) for microscopy, 30 days (23-43) for solid culture, and 16 days (13-21) for liquid culture. Median time to detection of resistance was 20 days (10-26) for line-probe assay and 106 days (30-124) for conventional drug-susceptibility testing. Use of the MTB/RIF test reduced median time to treatment for smear-negative tuberculosis from 56 days (39-81) to 5 days (2-8). The indeterminate rate of MTB/RIF testing was 2.4% (126 of 5321 samples) compared with 4.6% (441 of 9690) for cultures. INTERPRETATION: The MTB/RIF test can effectively be used in low-resource settings to simplify patients' access to early and accurate diagnosis, thereby potentially decreasing morbidity associated with diagnostic delay, dropout and mistreatment.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the risk factors for acquiring functional or cognitive disabilities during admission to a PICU. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a multicenter PICU database. SETTING: Twenty-four PICUs in the Virtual PICU Performance System network from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2010. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients, who are 1 month to 18 years old, who survived to discharge. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcomes were acquired global functional disability and cognitive disability during admission to a PICU, measured by change in Pediatric Overall Performance Category or in Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scores, respectively. The primary analysis cohort consisted of 29,352 admissions to the 24 Virtual PICU Performance System sites which collected the main outcome variables. Respectively, 10.3% and 3.4% of the cohort acquired global functional or cognitive disability. Trauma diagnosis (odds ratio, 4.50; 95% CI, 3.83-5.29; odds ratio, 3.91; 95% CI, 3.07-4.98), unscheduled admission to the PICU (odds ratio, 2.67; 95% CI, 2.27-3.12; odds ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.16-2.00), highest risk of mortality category (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.15-3.40), oncologic primary diagnoses (odds ratio, 5.61; 95% CI, 4.56-6.91; odds ratio, 4.30; 95% CI, 2.97-6.24), and neurologic primary diagnoses (odds ratio, 2.04, 95% CI, 1.70-2.44; odds ratio, 4.29, 95% CI, 3.18-5.78) were independently associated with acquiring both functional and cognitive disability. Intervention risk factors for acquiring both functional and cognitive disability included invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.60-2.00; odds ratio, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.36-3.39), renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.73-3.42; odds ratio, 1.76, 95% CI, 1.08-2.85), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (odds ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.24-2.95; odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.02-3.23), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (odds ratio, 7.40, 95% CI, 4.10-13.36; odds ratio, 14.04, 95% CI, 7.51-26.26). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a subset of patients whose potential for acquiring global functional and cognitive disability during admission to the PICU is high. This population may benefit from interventions that could mitigate this risk and from focused follow-up after discharge from the PICU.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a life-threatening malformation in neonates, but it is amenable to complete repair. Prenatal detection, diagnosis, and early management may modify neonatal mortality and mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: Preoperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality were compared in 68 neonates with prenatal diagnosis and in 250 neonates with a postnatal diagnosis of TGA over a period of 10 years. The delay between birth and admission was 2+/-2.8 hours in the prenatal group and 73+/-210 hours in the neonatal group (P<0.01). Clinical condition at arrival, including metabolic acidosis and multiorgan failure, was worse in the neonatal group (P<0.01). Once in the pediatric cardiology unit, the management was identical in the 2 groups (atrioseptostomy, PGE1 infusion, operation date). Preoperative mortality was 15 of 250 (6%; 95% CI, 3% to 9%) in the neonatal group and 0 of 68 in the prenatal group (P<0.05). Postoperative morbidity was not different (25 of 235 versus 6 of 68), but hospital stay was longer in the neonatal group (30+/-17 versus 24+/-11 days, P<0.01). In addition, postoperative mortality was significantly higher in the neonatal group (20 of 235 versus 0 of 68, P<0.01); however, the known risk factors for operative mortality were identical in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal diagnosis reduces mortality and morbidity in TGA. Prenatal detection of this cardiac defect must be increased to improve early neonatal management. In utero transfer of fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of TGA in an appropriate unit is mandatory.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: The goals were to describe trends in pediatric traumatic brain injury hospitalizations in the United States and to provide national benchmarks for state and regional comparisons. METHODS: Analysis of existing data (1991-2005) from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the largest longitudinal, all-payer, inpatient care database in the United States, was performed. Children 0 to 19 years of age were included. Annual rates of traumatic brain injury-related hospitalizations, stratified according to age, gender, severity of traumatic brain injury, and outcome, were determined. RESULTS: From 1991 to 2005, the estimated annual incidence rate of pediatric hospitalizations associated with traumatic brain injury decreased 39%, from 119.4 to 72.7 hospitalizations per 100,000. The rates decreased for all age groups and for both boys and girls, although the rate for boys remained consistently higher at each time point. Fatal hospitalization rates decreased from 3.5 deaths per 100,000 in 1991-1993 to 2.8 deaths per 100,000 in 2003-2005. The rate of mild traumatic brain injury hospitalizations accounted for most of the overall decrease, whereas nonfatal hospitalization rates for moderate and severe traumatic brain injuries remained relatively unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Although pediatric hospitalization rates for mild traumatic brain injuries have decreased over the past 15 years, rates for moderate and severe traumatic brain injuries are relatively unchanged. Our study provides national estimates of pediatric traumatic brain injury hospitalizations that can be used as benchmarks to increase injury prevention effectiveness through targeting of effective strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Reducing emergency admissions is a priority for the NHS. A single hospital's emergency care system was reorganised with the principles of front-loaded investigations, integration of specialties, reduced duplication, earlier decision making by senior clinicians and a combined emergency assessment area. The authors relocated our Medical Assessment Unit into our emergency department in 2006. The authors evaluated changes in admissions and mortality before and after 2006, compared with other similar hospitals. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental before and after study using routinely collected data. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1 acute hospital in England, the intervention site, was compared with 23 other English hospitals between 2001 and 2009. OUTCOME MEASURES: Our outcome measures were hospital standardised mortality ratios (HSMRs) for non-elective admissions and standardised admission ratios (SARs). RESULTS: The authors observed a statistically and clinically significant decrease in HSMR and SAR. The intervention hospital had the lowest HSMR and SAR of all the hospitals in our sample. This was statistically significant, p=0.0149 and p=0.0002, respectively. CONCLUSION: Integrating emergency care in one location is associated with a meaningful reduction in mortality and emergency admissions to hospital.},

The medical admissions unit and the emergency department (ED) have been combined into one emergency assessment unit. This paper aims to determine if reconfiguration has reduced non-elective hospital admissions and reduced mortality for non-elective admissions. DESIGN: A retrospective 'before and after' study in a teaching hospital. Routinely collected data were used to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. Setting One acute trust in the UK. Main outcome measures Inhospital mortality rates and standardised admission ratios (SAR) between 2003 and 2009. RESULTS: There was a significant trend towards improved survival, both for non-elective admissions and deaths in the ED (z=-3.92; p>0.001), despite the age and acuity of patients increasing. There was a marked decrease in the SAR. Formal complaints, incident reports and the proportion of patients leaving before treatment declined, whereas the proportion of patients re-admitted as an emergency within 28 days did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating emergency care within a hospital reduces hospital admissions, is associated with reduced inhospital mortality and a better quality of care.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Persons with intellectual disability (ID) and sleep problems exhibit more daytime challenging behaviours than persons with ID without sleep problems. Several anecdotal reports suggest that melatonin is not only effective in the treatment of insomnia, but also decreases daytime challenging behaviour. However, the effect of melatonin treatment on daytime challenging behaviour in persons with ID has not been investigated in a randomised controlled trial. METHOD: We investigated the effects of melatonin on challenging behaviour using data from two randomised controlled trials on the efficacy of melatonin on sleep problems in 49 persons (25 men, 24 women; mean age 18.2 years, SD = 17.1) with ID and chronic insomnia. Participants received either melatonin 5 mg (<6 years 2.5 mg) or placebo during 4 weeks. Daytime challenging behaviour was measured by the Storend Gedragsschaal voor Zwakzinnigen - Maladaptive Behaviour Scale for the Mentally Retarded (SGZ; Kraijer & Kema, 1994) at baseline week and the end of the fourth treatment week. Salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) was measured at baseline and the last day of the fourth treatment week. Sleep logs were used to gather information on sleep parameters. RESULTS: Melatonin treatment significantly reduced SGZ scores, sleep latency, and number and duration of night wakes, and treatment increased total sleep time and advanced DLMO. However, after 4 weeks of treatment, change in SGZ scores did not significantly correlate with change in sleep parameters, nor with change in DLMO. Relatively strong correlations were found between change in SGZ scores, change in DLMO and number of night wakes. CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin treatment in persons with ID and chronic insomnia decreases daytime challenging behaviour, probably by improving sleep maintenance or by improving circadian melatonin rhythmicity.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant clinical problem with few therapeutic interventions successfully translated to the clinic. Increased importance on the progressive, long-term consequences of TBI have been emphasized, both in the experimental and clinical literature. Thus, there is a need for a better understanding of the chronic consequences of TBI, with the ultimate goal of developing novel therapeutic interventions to treat the devastating consequences of brain injury. In models of mild, moderate, and severe TBI, histopathological and behavioral studies have emphasized the progressive nature of the initial traumatic insult and the involvement of multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, including sustained injury cascades leading to prolonged motor and cognitive deficits. Recently, the increased incidence in age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases in this patient population has also been emphasized. Pathomechanisms felt to be active in the acute and long-term consequences of TBI include excitotoxicity, apoptosis, inflammatory events, seizures, demyelination, white matter pathology, as well as decreased neurogenesis. The current article will review many of these pathophysiological mechanisms that may be important targets for limiting the chronic consequences of TBI.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Medicaid-insured children have high risk of asthma but are less likely to receive care in keeping with national guidelines. We targeted providers who care for a large proportion of Medicaid-insured children and presented a 2-session multimedia asthma-education seminar that emphasizes communication and teaching techniques, to enhance providers' asthma-care teaching skills. METHODS: Five Medicaid-approved health maintenance organizations recruited pediatric primary-care providers. Providers were surveyed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months to determine if they reported changes in their use of certain asthma-care communication techniques. RESULTS: Fifty-three of 70 participating providers completed the program and initial survey. They reported that 50% (median) of their patients were insured by Medicaid. At baseline, providers reported they were very confident of their asthma knowledge; however, they were less confident in interactions with patients/families regarding asthma self-management skills. Providers reported use of written plans less than half of the time. The response rate was 60% at 6 months and 71% at 1 year. Twenty-eight providers completed all 3 surveys. They reported significantly more frequent use of communication and counseling techniques that involved patient/parent asthma education and self-management skills at the 6-month point, that were partly sustained at 1 year. Reported provision of written asthma plans to patients had increased significantly at 6 months, but that increase was not sustained at the 1-year point. CONCLUSIONS: The seminar significantly enhanced knowledge of specific communication techniques related to asthma-teaching goals and reported use of asthma action plans to enhance self-management skills; however, these practices appear to need frequent reinforcement.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To describe pediatric severe asthma care, complications, and outcomes to plan for future prospective studies by the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: : Pediatric intensive care units in the United States that submit administrative data to the Pediatric Health Information System. PATIENTS: Children 1-18 yrs old treated in a Pediatric Health Information System pediatric intensive care unit for asthma during 2004-2008. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen-thousand five-hundred fifty-two children were studied; 2,812 (21%) were treated in a Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network and 10,740 (79%) were treated in a non-Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network pediatric intensive care unit. Medication use in individual Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network centers differed widely: ipratropium bromide (41%-84%), terbutaline (11%-74%), magnesium sulfate (23%-64%), and methylxanthines (0%-46%). Complications including pneumothorax (0%-0.6%), cardiac arrest (0.2%-2%), and aspiration (0.2%-2%) were rare. Overall use of medical therapies and complications at Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network centers were representative of pediatric asthma care at non-Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network pediatric intensive care units. Median length of pediatric intensive care unit stay at Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network centers was 1 to 2 days and death was rare (0.1%-3%). Ten percent of children treated at Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network centers received invasive mechanical ventilation compared to 12% at non-Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network centers. Overall 44% of patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation were intubated in the pediatric intensive care unit. Children intubated outside the pediatric intensive care unit had significantly shorter median ventilation days (1 vs. 3), pediatric intensive care unit days (2 vs. 4), and hospital days (4 vs. 7) compared to those intubated in the pediatric intensive care unit. Among children who received mechanical respiratory support, significantly more (41% vs. 25%) were treated with noninvasive ventilation and significantly fewer (41% vs. 58%) were intubated before pediatric intensive care unit care when treated in a Pediatric Health Information System hospital emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: Marked variations in medication therapies and mechanical support exist. Death and other complications were rare. More than half of patients treated with mechanical ventilation were intubated before pediatric intensive care unit care. Site of respiratory mechanical support initiation was associated with length of stay.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine adherence to guidelines for severe asthma care and evaluate regional variability in practice among pediatric intensive care units (PICU). STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of children treated for asthma in a PICU during 2000 to 2003. We utilized the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database to identify patients and determine use of asthma therapies when patients did not improve with standard therapy (inhaled beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). RESULTS: Of 7125 children studied, 59% received inhaled anticholinergic medications. Use of other therapies included systemic beta-agonists (n = 1841 [26%]), magnesium sulfate (n = 1521 [21%]), methylxanthines (n = 426 [6%]), inhaled helium-oxygen gas mixture (heliox) (n = 740 [10%]), and endotracheal intubation with ventilation (n=1024 [14%]). Use of therapies varied by census region. Over half the patients (n = 524) who received ventilation did so for < or = 1 day. Adjusted for severity of illness, use of mechanical ventilation varied significantly by census division; however, much of the variation was among children ventilated for < or = 1 day. CONCLUSION: Adherence to national guidelines for use of inhaled anticholinergics among critically ill children is low, and marked variation in use of invasive ventilation exists. More explicit guidelines regarding indications for invasive ventilation may improve asthma care.},

Methods: Patients with a primary diagnosis of asthma treated from May 1995 to February 2000 were identified. Demographic information and clinical data were evaluated to determine whether there was an association between Medicaid insurance, severity of illness, and length of stay. RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of the children had Medicaid insurance; 22% of children with Medicaid insurance received mechanical ventilation compared with 15% of those with commercial insurance and 16% in a health maintenance organization. After adjustment for severity of illness (Pediatric Risk of Mortality III and use of invasive therapies), Medicaid insurance was significantly associated with increased length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital. Among children who received mechanical ventilation, patients with Medicaid also received ventilator support significantly longer. CONCLUSIONS: Asthmatic children receiving Medicaid had longer pediatric intensive care unit and hospital stays and an increased risk of mechanical ventilation compared with asthmatic children with commercial or health maintenance organization insurance. Further studies are needed to evaluate differences in outcome and resource utilization for economically disadvantaged asthmatic children.},

  Abstract                 = {Recurrent episodes of inflammation underlie numerous pathologies, notably those of inflammatory bowel diseases. In this study, we describe a population of macrophages in a novel state of activation that mitigates colitis in mice. The cells responsible for this effect, called IFN-gamma-stimulated monocyte-derived cells (IFNgamma-MdC), derive from mouse spleen, blood, and bone marrow monocytes and are distinguished from known macrophage populations by mode of generation, cell surface phenotype, and function. IFNgamma-MdC only arise when macrophages are cultivated in the presence of CD40L-expressing CD4+ T cells, M-CSF, and IFN-gamma. IFNgamma-MdC express markers including F4/80, CD11b/c, CD86, and CD274; they are negative for CD4, CD8, Gr1, CD19, CD80, and CD207. Functionally, IFNgamma-MdC are defined by their capacity to enrich cocultured T cell populations for CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory cells; this enrichment, constituting up to 60% or more of residual lymphocytes, is attributed to an expansion, but also to a cell contact and caspase-dependent depletion of activated T cells. In mice, IFNgamma-MdC delivered i.v. traffic to gut-associated peripheral lymphoid tissues, including the mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, and colonic mucosa, and promote the clinical and histological resolution of chronic colitis. We conclude that IFNgamma-MdC represent macrophages in a novel state of activation, possessing multiple T cell-suppressive effects with therapeutic potential for the treatment of autoimmune inflammation.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: In light of the rapidly increasing frequency of pediatric CT examinations, the purpose of our study was to assess the lifetime cancer mortality risks attributable to radiation from pediatric CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Organ doses as a function of age-at-diagnosis were estimated for common CT examinations, and estimated attributable lifetime cancer mortality risks (per unit dose) for different organ sites were applied. Standard models that assume a linear extrapolation of risks from intermediate to low doses were applied. On the basis of current standard practice, the same exposures (milliampere-seconds) were assumed, independent of age. RESULTS: The larger doses and increased lifetime radiation risks in children produce a sharp increase, relative to adults, in estimated risk from CT. Estimated lifetime cancer mortality risks attributable to the radiation exposure from a CT in a 1-year-old are 0.18% (abdominal) and 0.07% (head)-an order of magnitude higher than for adults-although those figures still represent a small increase in cancer mortality over the natrual background rate. In the United States, of approximately 600,000 abdominal and head CT examinations annually performed in children under the age of 15 years, a rough estimate is that 500 of these individuals might ultimately die from cancer attributable to the CT radiation. CONCLUSION: The best available risk estimates suggest that pediatric CT will result in significantly increased lifetime radiation risk over adult CT, both because of the increased dose per milliampere-second, and the increased lifetime risk per unit dose. Lower milliampere-second settings can be used for children without significant loss of information. Although the risk-benefit balance is still strongly tilted toward benefit, because the frequency of pediatric CT examinations is rapidly increasing, estimates that quantitative lifetime radiation risks for children undergoing CT are not negligible may stimulate more active reduction of CT exposure settings in pediatric patients.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The Institute of Medicine calls for the use of clinical guidelines and practice parameters to promote "best practices" and to improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: 2007 update of the 2002 American College of Critical Care Medicine Clinical Guidelines for Hemodynamic Support of Neonates and Children with Septic Shock. PARTICIPANTS: Society of Critical Care Medicine members with special interest in neonatal and pediatric septic shock were identified from general solicitation at the Society of Critical Care Medicine Educational and Scientific Symposia (2001-2006). METHODS: The Pubmed/MEDLINE literature database (1966-2006) was searched using the keywords and phrases: sepsis, septicemia, septic shock, endotoxemia, persistent pulmonary hypertension, nitric oxide, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and American College of Critical Care Medicine guidelines. Best practice centers that reported best outcomes were identified and their practices examined as models of care. Using a modified Delphi method, 30 experts graded new literature. Over 30 additional experts then reviewed the updated recommendations. The document was subsequently modified until there was greater than 90% expert consensus. RESULTS: The 2002 guidelines were widely disseminated, translated into Spanish and Portuguese, and incorporated into Society of Critical Care Medicine and AHA sanctioned recommendations. Centers that implemented the 2002 guidelines reported best practice outcomes (hospital mortality 1%-3% in previously healthy, and 7%-10% in chronically ill children). Early use of 2002 guidelines was associated with improved outcome in the community hospital emergency department (number needed to treat = 3.3) and tertiary pediatric intensive care setting (number needed to treat = 3.6); every hour that went by without guideline adherence was associated with a 1.4-fold increased mortality risk. The updated 2007 guidelines continue to recognize an increased likelihood that children with septic shock, compared with adults, require 1) proportionally larger quantities of fluid, 2) inotrope and vasodilator therapies, 3) hydrocortisone for absolute adrenal insufficiency, and 4) ECMO for refractory shock. The major new recommendation in the 2007 update is earlier use of inotrope support through peripheral access until central access is attained. CONCLUSION: The 2007 update continues to emphasize early use of age-specific therapies to attain time-sensitive goals, specifically recommending 1) first hour fluid resuscitation and inotrope therapy directed to goals of threshold heart rates, normal blood pressure, and capillary refill <or=2 secs, and 2) subsequent intensive care unit hemodynamic support directed to goals of central venous oxygen saturation >70% and cardiac index 3.3-6.0 L/min/m.},

Using a qualitative approach, our team previously explored how the culture and related ways of providing care in one urban Midwestern children's hospital PICU affected parents' bereavement needs and experiences. We describe using this qualitative foundation in the development of a new quantitative instrument to more widely validate and measure bereaved parents' needs around the time of a child's death across multiple PICUs.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: The present research addressed the following important question in pediatric medicine: Can participation in a new family-centered preventive intervention, the Strong African American Families-Teen (SAAF-T) program, deter conduct problems, substance use, substance use problems, and depressive symptoms among rural black adolescents across 22 months? METHODS: Data were collected from 502 black families in rural Georgia, assigned randomly to SAAF-T or an attention control condition. The prevention condition consisted of 5 consecutive meetings at community facilities with separate, concurrent sessions for caregivers and adolescents followed by a caregiver-adolescent session in which families practiced skills they learned in the separate sessions. Adolescents self-reported conduct problem behaviors, substance use, substance use problems, and depressive symptoms at ages 16 years (pretest) and 17 years 10 months (long-term assessment). RESULTS: Adolescents who participated in SAAF-T evinced lower increases in conduct problem behavior, substance use, substance use problems, and depressive symptom frequencies than did adolescents in the attention control condition across the 22 months between pretest and long-term assessment. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate efficacy in a prevention program designed to deter conduct problems, substance use, substance use problems, and depressive symptoms among rural black adolescents. Because SAAF-T is a manualized, structured program, it can be easily disseminated to public health agencies, schools, churches, boys' and girls' clubs, and other community organizations.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Substantial care variation occurs in a number of pediatric diseases. METHODS: We evaluated the variability in healthcare resource utilization and its association with clinical outcomes among children, aged 1-18 years, hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Each of 29 children's hospitals contributing data to the Pediatric Hospital Information System was ranked based on the proportion of CAP patients receiving each of 8 diagnostic tests. Primary outcome variable was length of stay (LOS), revisit to the emergency department or readmission within 14 days of discharge. RESULTS: Of 21,213 children hospitalized with nonsevere CAP, median age was 3 years (interquartile range: 1-6 years). Laboratory testing and antibiotic usage varied widely across hospitals; cephalosporins were the most commonly prescribed antibiotic. There were large differences in the processes of care by age categories. The median LOS was 2 days (interquartile range: 1-3 days) and differed across hospitals; 25% of hospitals had median LOS >/= 3 days. Hospital-level variation occurred in 14-day emergency department visits and 14-day readmission, ranging from 0.9% to 4.9% and from 1.5% to 4.4%, respectively. Increased utilization of diagnostic testing was associated with longer hospital LOS (P = 0.036) but not with probability of 14-day readmission (Spearman rho = 0.234; P = 0.225). There was an inverse correlation between LOS and 14-day revisit to the emergency department (rho = -0.48; P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Wide variability occurred in diagnostic testing for children hospitalized with CAP. Increased diagnostic testing was associated with a longer LOS. Earlier hospital discharge did not correlate with increased 14-day readmission. The precise interaction of increased use with longer LOS remains unclear.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is used to support children with respiratory failure. When extracorporeal membrane oxygenation duration is prolonged, decisions regarding ongoing support are difficult as a result of limited prognostic data. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Multi-institutional data reported to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry. PATIENTS: Patients aged 1 month to 18 yrs supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory failure from 1993 to 2007 who received support for >/= 21 days. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 3213 children supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the study period, 389 (12%) were supported >/= 21 days. Median patient age was 9.1 months (interquartile range, 2.5-41.7 months). Median weight was 6.7 kg (interquartile range, 3.5-15.8 kg). Survival for this group was 38%, significantly lower than survival reported for children supported </= 14 days (61%, p < .001). Among children supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for >/= 21 days, no differences were found between survivors and nonsurvivors with regard to acute pulmonary diagnosis, pre-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation comorbidities, pre-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation adjunctive therapies, or pre-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation blood gas parameters. Only peak inspiratory pressure was significantly different in survivors. Complications occurring on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were more common among nonsurvivors. The use of inotropic infusion (odds ratio 1.64; 95% confidence interval 1.07-2.52), acidosis (pH <7.2) during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (odds ratio 2.62; 95% confidence interval 1.51-4.55), and male gender (odds ratio 1.95; 95% confidence interval 1.21-3.15) were independently associated with increased odds of death. CONCLUSION: Survival declines with duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Male gender and inadequate cardiorespiratory status during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation increased the risk of death. Prolonged support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation appears reasonable unless multiorgan failure develops.},

METHOD: Parents completed PTSD questionnaires 3 and 9 months (N = 190) after PICU treatment. Risk factors included pretrauma data, medical data, social demographics and posttraumatic stress responses at 3 months. RESULTS: In total, 30.3% of parents met criteria for subclinical PTSD and 12.6% for clinical PTSD at 3 months. Clinical PTSD prevalence rates did not change over time. At 9 months, 10.5% of parents still met criteria for PTSD. Number of earlier stressful life events, earlier psychosocial care and posttraumatic stress responses at 3 months predicted persistent subclinical and clinical PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: PICU admission is a stressful event associated with persistent parental PTSD. Assessment of risk factors can facilitate detection of persistent PTSD for early intervention.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine body and tissue compartment-specific burdens (mg) of total mercury (THg), tissues were weighed and analyzed for THg concentration (microg/g fw) in Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardii) pups from central California in 2006. THg concentrations were related as follows: hair >> liver = kidney = pelt > muscle > other = heart > brain > blubber > bone. THg burden, however, was related as: pelt = muscle > liver = other > kidney = blubber > brain = heart > bone. THg concentration and burden in muscle were strongly associated with delta(15)N. delta(13)C and delta(15)N values were significantly greater in muscle than liver, and delta(13)C was significantly lesser the longer animals were in rehabilitation. Because THg concentration and burden in muscle correlated most significantly with other tissue compartments, we recommend that muscle from the specific sites we sampled be used instead of liver or hair for biomonitoring THg in harbor seals. Assessment of proportional THg burdens within each tissue compartment for harbor seals pups included use of a conceptual model, allowing for more complete visual characterization of THg body burden.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac performance may be assessed noninvasively at the patient's bedside by using thoracic bioimpedance. However, it is unclear if this technique can be used reliably in critically injured obese patients because of increased body habitus and chest wall mass. METHODS: A prospectively maintained database was used to identify all trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit who underwent simultaneous measurement of cardiac performance by using both thoracic bioimpedance and thermodilution. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on their body mass index (BMI). Patients with a BMI less than 30 kg/m(2) were classified as nonobese, and patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) or greater were categorized as obese. RESULTS: There were 285 patients who underwent 1,138 simultaneous measurements of cardiac index by using both bioimpedance and thermodilution. There were 211 nonobese patients (BMI = 25 +/- 3 kg/m(2)) and 74 obese patients (BMI = 34 +/- 4 kg/m(2)). Bioimpedance correlated well with thermodilution for the entire population (r = .84, P < .0001), and was reliable equally in obese (r = .85, P < .0001) and nonobese (r = .82, P < .0001) patients. There actually was less test bias in the obese group (-.06 +/- .69) than in the nonobese group (-.16 +/- .75, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic bioimpedance technology may be used reliably as a noninvasive alternative to pulmonary artery catheterization for assessment of cardiac performance in critically injured obese patients.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The role of helicopter transport (HT) in civilian trauma care remains controversial. The objective of this study was to compare patient outcomes after transport from the scene of injury by HT and ground transport using a national patient sample. METHODS: Patients transported from the scene of injury by HT or ground transport in 2007 were identified using the National Trauma Databank version 8. Injury severity, utilization of hospital resources, and outcomes were compared. Stepwise logistic regression was used to determine whether transport modality was a predictor of survival or discharge to home after adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: There were 258,387 patients transported by helicopter (16%) or ground (84%). Mean Injury Severity Score was higher in HT patients (15.9 +/- 12.3 vs. 10.2 +/- 9.5, p < 0.01), as was the percentage of patients with Injury Severity Score >15 (42.6% vs. 20.8%; odds ratio [OR], 2.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.76-2.89). HT patients had higher rates of intensive care unit admission (43.5% vs. 22.9%; OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 2.53-2.64) and mechanical ventilation (20.8% vs. 7.4%; OR, 3.30; 95% CI, 3.21-3.40). HT was a predictor of survival (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.17-1.27) and discharge to home (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07) after adjustment for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Trauma patients transported by helicopter were more severely injured, had longer transport times, and required more hospital resources than those transported by ground. Despite this, HT patients were more likely to survive and were more likely to be discharged home after treatment when compared with those transported by ground. Despite concerns regarding helicopter utilization in the civilian setting, this study shows that HT has merit and impacts outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The mortality of traumatic brain injury (TBI) continues to decline, emphasizing functional outcomes. Trauma center designation has been linked to survival after TBI, but the impact on functional outcomes is unclear. The objective was to determine whether trauma center designation influenced functional outcomes after moderate and severe TBI. METHODS: Trauma subjects presenting to an American College of Surgeons (ACS) Level I or II trauma center with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) <or=12 who survived to discharge were identified using the National Trauma Databank (2002-2006). Outcomes were functional independence (FI) defined as a modified functional independence measure (FIM) of 12, and independent expression (IE) defined as a FIM component of 4. These were compared between Level I and Level II centers in subjects with both moderate (GCS 9-12) and severe (GCS <or=8) TBI using stepwise logistic regression to adjust for demographics, injuries, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Analysis identified 25,170 subjects (72% severe TBI). After adjusting for covariates, ACS Level I designation was associated with FI (odds ratio: 1.16; confidence interval: 1.07-1.24, p < 0.01) and IE (1.10; 1.03-1.17, p < 0.01) after severe TBI. Trauma center designation was not associated with FI or IE after moderate TBI. CONCLUSIONS: ACS trauma center designation is significantly associated with FI and IE after severe, but not moderate TBI. Prospective study is warranted to verify and explore factors contributing to this discrepancy.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an interactive physician seminar that has been shown to improve patient/parent satisfaction and to decrease emergency department visits for children with asthma was also effective for those children from low-income families. DESIGN: Seventy-four pediatricians and 637 of their patients were randomized to receive two asthma seminars or no educational programs and were observed for 2 years. SETTING: Physicians in the New York, NY, and Ann Arbor, MI, areas were enrolled, and, on average, 10 patients with asthma per provider were surveyed and observed for 2 years. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: A total of 637 subjects were enrolled, and 369 subjects remained in the study after 2 years. Of these, 279 had complete medical and survey information. INTERVENTIONS: Physicians were randomized, and then a random sample of their patients was enrolled and surveyed regarding the physician's communication style, the child's asthma symptoms, medical needs, and asthma care. Low income was defined as annual income of < 20,000 dollars. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The families of 36 children (13%) had an income of < 20,000 dollars, and they were treated by 23 physicians. Low-income children in the treatment group tended to have higher levels of use of controller medications, to receive a written asthma action plan, and to miss fewer days of school, although these differences were not statistically significant compared to low-income children in the control group. However, low-income treatment group children were significantly less likely to be admitted to an emergency department (annual rate, 0.208 vs 1.441, respectively) or to a hospital (annual rate, 0 vs 0.029, respectively) for asthma care compared to children in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The educational program for physicians improved asthma outcomes for their low-income patients. Provider interventions targeted to these high-risk patients may diminish hospital and emergency department asthma care.},

The clinical history, course, and outcome of 63 children with this CT pattern are reviewed. Fourteen children had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of greater than 8; all made a complete recovery and follow-up CT scans were normal. Forty-nine children had Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 8 or less. Fifteen had a history of a lucid period following the initial unconsciousness. One of these children died of delayed brain swelling, the others recovered well with minimal neurological deficit. Thirty-four children were rendered immediately and continuously unconscious. There was a high incidence of second lesions on the CT scan, 50% of this group developed intracranial hypertension and five died. All of the others were in coma for periods ranging from weeks to months. Follow-up CT scans showed an extracerebral collection with a density of cerebrospinal fluid in 27% of the patients, and ventriculomegaly with large sulci in 35%, whereas this pattern was seen only once in those with a lucid period. The difference between those with and without a lucid period is related to the degree of primary diffuse impact injury to the white matter.},

  Abstract                 = {The pathophysiology and outcome following severe head injury in 85 children are presented. The commonest initial CT diagnosis was of acute brain swelling. This swelling was associated with an increased white matter density on the CT scan which decreased to normal concomitant with recovery and increased ventricular size. CBF measurements in 6 of these patients revealed an increased blood flow despite a decreased CMRO2 and clinical coma. This CT pattern of diffuse swelling is believed to be due to acute cerebrovascular congestion and hyperemia and not to edema. Because of this, all children were treated with endotracheal intubation and controlled hyperventilation as part of the initial management. Mass lesions were uncommon, 20%. ICP was monitored in 40 children. The ICP rose above 20 Torr despite therapy in 80% of children with decerebrate or flaccid coma and in only 20% of children with spontaneous motor function. The ICP was at its highest between the second and fifth day. Aggressive therapy to control the ICP, with barbiturates if necessary, was successful in 80% of the patients. The overall results were useful recovery in 87.5% of the children, 3.5% were left vegetative or severely disabled and 9% died.},

Pain at the injection site during the initial injections was the only adverse effect attributable to anakinra. Untoward effects of corticosteroid treatment were mild because prolonged therapy with high-dose corticosteroids could be avoided. These results suggest that early institution of interleukin 1 blockade merits further investigation for the treatment of macrophage activation syndrome and, perhaps, related conditions such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.},

  Abstract                 = {The simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen is a potent oncogene able to transform many cell types and has been implicated in leukemia and lymphoma. In this report, we have achieved sporadic SV40 T-antigen expression in mature B cells in mice, by insertion of a SV40 T antigen gene in opposite transcriptional orientation in the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy (H) chain locus between the D and J(H) segments. SV40 T-antigen expression appeared to result from retention of the targeted germline allele and concomitant antisense transcription of SV40 large T in mature B cells, leading to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although B-cell development was unperturbed in young mice, aging mice showed accumulation of a monoclonal B-cell population in which the targeted IgH allele was in germline configuration and the wild-type IgH allele had a productive V(D)J recombination. These leukemic B cells were IgD(low)CD5(+) and manifested nonrandom usage of V, D, and J segments. V(H) regions were either unmutated, with preferential usage of the VH11 family, or manifested extensive somatic hypermutation. Our findings provide an animal model for B-CLL and show that pathways activated by SV40 T antigen play important roles in the pathogenesis of B-CLL.},

Little is known about the perception and knowledge that GPs have about this tool in their daily practice. A survey has been conducted as part of a screening campaign for various diseases. The primary objective of the present study was to assess the perception and the knowledge of the FRAX tool by GPs. The secondary objective was to assess the impact of an information brochure about the FRAX tool on these outcomes. The survey was sent to a sample of 700 GPs after only half of them had received the information brochure. The survey results show that, out of the 193 doctors who responded to the survey, one-third know the FRAX tool but less than 20 % use it in their daily clinical practice. Among those who use it, the FRAX tool is largely seen as a complementary but not as an essential tool in the diagnosis or in the management of osteoporosis. It appears that the brochure could improve the knowledge of the FRAX tool but it would not be more efficient on its use in daily practice than the other sources of information. At present, the use of the FRAX tool in Belgium is limited but an information brochure could have a positive impact on the knowledge of the FRAX tool.},

Additionally, we wanted to compare the two drugs in terms of patient preference for treatment, patient and parent satisfaction with treatment, frequency of inhaled albuterol use, adherence to treatment, and safety. This was a 12-week randomized, open-label, crossover study conducted in 42 primary care and asthma/allergy specialty centers in the United States. Three hundred thirty-three asthmatic patients, ages 6 to 11 years, who had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 60%-85% (inclusive) of predicted value with > or = 12% reversibility after administration of an inhaled beta-agonist and who used albuterol on at least 7 of the last 14 days of the run-in period. After a 2- to 3-week run-in period, patients were randomized either to 4 weeks of montelukast (5-mg chewable tablet once daily) followed by a 2-week washout period, then 4 weeks of cromolyn (two puffs 4 times daily from a metered-dose inhaler) or to the reverse sequence. More parents preferred montelukast (87%) than cromolyn (12%; p < 0.001). More patients preferred montelukast (82%) than cromolyn (17%; p < 0.001). Daily albuterol use (puffs/day) was reduced by 38% during montelukast therapy vs. 23% during cromolyn therapy. Seventy-eight percent of patients reported being highly adherent to montelukast therapy compared with 42% to cromolyn therapy (p < 0.001). Fewer patients receiving montelukast discontinued because of asthma exacerbation (1.0% vs. 5.0%, respectively), and fewer patients reported worsening asthma while receiving montelukast (3.5% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.036). Parents' and patients' preference, parents' and patients' satisfaction, and patients' adherence to therapy were all significantly better with oral montelukast compared with inhaled cromolyn. Beta-agonist use was decreased when taking montelukast, which was safe and well-tolerated.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was three-fold: a) to examine variations in care of patients with severe head injury in academic trauma centers across the United States; b) to determine the proportion of patients who received care according to the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines; and c) to correlate the outcome from severe traumatic brain injury with the care received. DESIGN: Retrospective data collection for consecutive patients with closed head injury and long bone fracture admitted over an 8-month period. SETTING: Thirty-four academic trauma centers in the United States PATIENTS: All patients admitted with a presenting Glasgow Coma Scale score < or = 8. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Variations in care were assessed, including prehospital intubation, intracranial pressure monitoring, use of osmotic agents, hyperventilation, and computed tomography scan utilization. Aggressive centers were defined as those placing intracranial pressure monitors in >50% of patients meeting the Brain Trauma Foundation criteria for intracranial pressure monitoring. The primary outcome variables were mortality, functional status at discharge, and length of stay. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed for aggressive vs. nonaggressive centers. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the association between type of center and mortality rate. Length of stay was evaluated by using linear regression. RESULTS: There was considerable variation in the rates of prehospital intubation, intracranial pressure monitoring, intracranial pressure-directed therapy, and head computed tomography scan utilization across centers. Management at an aggressive center was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of mortality (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.66). There was no statistically significant difference in functional status at the time of discharge for survivors. Adjusted length of stay for survivors at aggressive centers was shorter, compared with the length of stay at nonaggressive centers: -6 days (95% confidence interval, -14 to 2 days). CONCLUSION: Considerable national variation in the care of severely head-injured patients persists. An "aggressive" management strategy is associated with decreased mortality rate for patients with severe head injury, with no significant difference in functional status at discharge among survivors.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: In the course of a meningococcal infection, invasive and severe disease occurs in a restricted number of individuals. The predominant mechanism of death in case of meningococcal septic shock is circulatory failure. Inotropic requirements between patients vary widely. We investigated whether polymorphisms in genes regulating the hemodynamic response influence the amount of inotropics required or the susceptibility to severe meningococcal disease. DESIGN: Retrospective case control study. SETTING: Single-center pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). PATIENTS: Fifty-six cases (all consecutive patients admitted to the PICU between 1993 and 2001 with a proven meningococcal infection) and 136 controls. Patients were divided into two groups according to their inotropic requirements. INTERVENTION: DNA analysis was performed to determine the polymorphisms of the beta-adrenergic receptor gene-1, beta-adrenergic receptor gene-2, alpha-adducin, angiotensin converting enzyme, and angiotensin II type-1 receptor-1 genes. RESULTS: For the alpha-adducin gene a significant difference of the genotype distribution was found between the cases and controls. The odds ratio for admission to the PICU with meningococcal sepsis with or without meningitis, for carriers of the variant allele (Gly460Trp or Trp460Trp) was 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.11-4.04; p < 0.02). Cases, homozygote for the wild-type allele of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor at locus 389, were more likely to have a low pediatric risk of mortality score on admission (odds ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.11-11.76). No difference was found in the distribution of the beta-adrenergic receptor gene-1, beta-adrenergic receptor gene-2, angiotensin converting enzyme, and angiotensin II type-1 receptor-1 polymorphisms between the two groups of patients or between cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients admitted to the PICU with a meningococcal infection, the variant allele of the alpha-adducin gene was more prevalent compared with controls. Patients with the variant allele of the beta-adrenergic receptor gene-1 at locus 389 were more likely to have a high pediatric risk of mortality score on admission. The mechanism and clinical relevance of these findings is unclear.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to develop a model that accurately predicts mortality among injured children based on components of the initial patient evaluation and that is generalizable to diverse acute care settings. Important predictive variables obtained in an emergency setting are frequently missing in even large national databases, limiting their effectiveness for developing predictions. In this study, a model predicting pediatric trauma mortality was developed using a national database and methods to handle missing data that may avoid biases that can occur restricting analyses to complete cases. METHODS: Records of pediatric patients included in the National Pediatric Trauma Registry (NPTR) between 1996 and 1999 were used as a training set in a logistic regression model to predict hospital mortality using vital signs, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and intubation status. Multiple imputation was applied to handle missing data. The model was tested using independent data from the NPTR and National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). RESULTS: Complete case analysis identified only GCS-eye and intubation status as predictors of mortality. A model based on complete case analysis had good discrimination (c-index = 0.784) and excellent calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow c-statistic, 6.8) (p > 0.05). Using multiple imputation, three additional predictors of mortality (systolic blood pressure, pulse, and GCS-motor) were identified and improved model performance was observed. The model developed using multiple imputation had excellent discrimination (c-index, 0.947-0.973) in both test datasets. Calibration was better in the NPTR testing set than in the NTDB (Hosmer-Lemeshow c-statistic, 9.2 for NPTR [p > 0.05] and 258.2 for NTDB [p < 0.05]). At a probability cutoff that minimized misclassification in the training set, the false-negative and false-negative rates of the model were better than those obtained with either the Revised Trauma Score (RTS) or Pediatric Trauma Score using data from the NPTR testing set. Although the false-positive rates were lower with the RTS using data from the NTDB, the false-negative rates of the proposed model and the RTS were similar in this test dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Using multiple imputation to handle missing data, a model predicting pediatric trauma mortality was developed that compared favorably with existing trauma scores. Application of these methods may produce predictive trauma models that are more statistically reliable and applicable in clinical practice.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Accurate adjustment for injury severity is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of trauma management. While the choice of injury coding scheme used for modeling affects performance, the impact of combining coding schemes on performance has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to use Bayesian logistic regression to develop models predicting hospital mortality in injured children and to compare the performance of models developed using different injury coding schemes. METHODS: Records of children (age < 15 years) admitted after injury were obtained from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) and the National Pediatric Trauma Registry (NPTR) and used to train Bayesian logistic regression models predicting mortality using three injury coding schemes (International Classification of Disease-9th revision [ICD-9] injury codes, the Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] severity scores, and the Barell matrix) and their combinations. Model performance was evaluated using independent data from the NTDB and the Kids' Inpatient Database 2003 (KID). RESULTS: Discrimination was optimal when modeling both ICD-9 and AIS severity codes (area under the receiver operating curve [AUC] = 0.921 [NTDB] and 0.967 [KID], Hosmer-Lemeshow [HL] h-statistic = 115 [NTDB] and 147 [KID]), while calibration was optimal when modeling coding based on the Barell matrix (AUC = 0.882 [NTDB] and 0.936 [KID], HL h-statistic = 19 [NTDB] and 69 [KID]). When compared to models based on ICD-9 codes alone, models that also included AIS severity scores and coding from the Barell matrix showed improved discrimination and calibration. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality models that incorporate additional injury coding schemes perform better than those based on ICD-9 codes alone in the setting of pediatric trauma. Combining injury coding schemes may be an effective approach for improving the predictive performance of empirically derived estimates of injury mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Neuroimaging is an essential component of the acute stroke evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more accurate than computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of stroke, but is more costly and time-consuming. We sought to describe changes in MRI utilization from 1999 to 2008. METHODS: We performed a serial cross-sectional study with time trends of neuroimaging in patients with a primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification discharge diagnosis of stroke admitted through the emergency department in the State Inpatient Databases from 10 states. MRI utilization was measured by Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project criteria. Data were included for states from 1999 to 2008 where MRI utilization could be identified. RESULTS: A total of 624,842 patients were hospitalized for stroke in the period of interest. MRI utilization increased in all states. Overall, MRI absolute utilization increased 38%, and relative utilization increased 235% (28% of strokes in 1999 to 66% in 2008). Over the same interval, CT utilization changed little (92% in 1999 to 95% in 2008). MRI use varied widely by state. In 2008, MRI utilization ranged from a low of 55% of strokes in Oregon to a high of 79% in Arizona. Diagnostic imaging was the fastest growing component of total hospital costs (213% increase from 1999 to 2007). INTERPRETATION: MRI utilization during stroke hospitalization increased substantially, with wide geographic variation. Rather than replacing CT, MRI is supplementing it. Consequently, neuroimaging has been the fastest growing component of hospitalization cost in stroke. Recent neuroimaging practices in stroke are not standardized and may represent an opportunity to improve the efficiency of stroke care.},

  Abstract                 = {AIMS: The incidence of clinical events related to medication errors and/or adverse drug reactions reported in the literature varies by a degree that cannot solely be explained by the clinical setting, the varying scrutiny of investigators or varying definitions of drug-related events. Our hypothesis was that the individual complexity of many clinical cases may pose relevant limitations for current definitions and algorithms used to identify, classify and count adverse drug-related events. METHODS: Based on clinical cases derived from an observational study we identified and classified common clinical problems that cannot be adequately characterized by the currently used definitions and algorithms. RESULTS: It appears that some key models currently used to describe the relation of medication errors (MEs), adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and adverse drug events (ADEs) can easily be misinterpreted or contain logical inconsistencies that limit their accurate use to all but the simplest clinical cases. A key limitation of current models is the inability to deal with complex interactions such as one drug causing two clinically distinct side effects or multiple drugs contributing to a single clinical event. Using a large set of clinical cases we developed a revised model of the interdependence between MEs, ADEs and ADRs and extended current event definitions when multiple medications cause multiple types of problems. We propose algorithms that may help to improve the identification, classification and counting of drug-related events. CONCLUSIONS: The new model may help to overcome some of the limitations that complex clinical cases pose to current paper- or software-based drug therapy safety.},

  Abstract                 = {AIM: To describe the admission characteristics and outcomes of children admitted to paediatric intensive care because of acute diabetes complications in England and Wales. METHODS: Retrospective review of children admitted to paediatric intensive care in England and Wales between April 2003 and March 2007 with acute diabetes complications using data from the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet). RESULTS: There were 341 admissions in 330 patients for acute diabetes complications, comprising 0.6% of all 56 322 intensive care admissions. There was a steady annual increase during this period from 0.54% to 0.67%. The majority of admissions were for ketoacidosis (87%), with more female admissions than males (56% vs. 44%). Forty per cent of the diabetes admissions were aged 11-15 years. There were five deaths (1.5%), all female. CONCLUSIONS: Acute diabetes complications are an increasing cause of admission to paediatric intensive care, particularly for teenage girls. The overall mortality rate was low for intensive care admissions for diabetes. Earlier diagnosis of new cases, heightened awareness of this condition and better management of existing diabetic patients may obviate the need for costly intensive care treatment.},

SETTING: The six sites, seven hospitals of the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network, and 17 outside sites at academic medical centers with pediatric intensive care units. RESULTS: Despite high coverage for childhood vaccination, pertussis causes substantial morbidity and mortality in US children, especially among infants. In pediatric intensive care units, Bordetella pertussis is a community-acquired pathogen associated with critical illness and death. The incidence of medical and developmental sequelae in critical pertussis survivors remains unknown, and the appropriate strategies for treatment and support remain unclear. The Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network Critical Pertussis Study has begun to evaluate critical pertussis in a prospective cohort. CONCLUSION: Research is urgently needed to provide an evidence base that might optimize management for critical pertussis, a serious, disabling, and too often fatal illness for U.S. children and those in the developing world.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: : To investigate whether a daily exercise session, using a bedside cycle ergometer, is a safe and effective intervention in preventing or attenuating the decrease in functional exercise capacity, functional status, and quadriceps force that is associated with prolonged intensive care unit stay. A prolonged stay in the intensive care unit is associated with muscle dysfunction, which may contribute to an impaired functional status up to 1 yr after hospital discharge. No evidence is available concerning the effectiveness of an early exercise training intervention to prevent these detrimental complications. DESIGN: : Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: : Medical and surgical intensive care unit at University Hospital Gasthuisberg. PATIENTS: : Ninety critically ill patients were included as soon as their cardiorespiratory condition allowed bedside cycling exercise (starting from day 5), given they still had an expected prolonged intensive care unit stay of at least 7 more days. INTERVENTIONS: : Both groups received respiratory physiotherapy and a daily standardized passive or active motion session of upper and lower limbs. In addition, the treatment group performed a passive or active exercise training session for 20 mins/day, using a bedside ergometer. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: : All outcome data are reflective for survivors. Quadriceps force and functional status were assessed at intensive care unit discharge and hospital discharge. Six-minute walking distance was measured at hospital discharge. No adverse events were identified during and immediately after the exercise training. At intensive care unit discharge, quadriceps force and functional status were not different between groups. At hospital discharge, 6-min walking distance, isometric quadriceps force, and the subjective feeling of functional well-being (as measured with "Physical Functioning" item of the Short Form 36 Health Survey questionnaire) were significantly higher in the treatment group (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: : Early exercise training in critically ill intensive care unit survivors enhanced recovery of functional exercise capacity, self-perceived functional status, and muscle force at hospital discharge.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Although proper outpatient asthma management sometimes requires care from subspecialists, there is little information on factors affecting receipt of subspecialty care in a managed care setting. OBJECTIVE: To determine factors associated with receipt of subspecialty care for children with asthma in a managed care organization. METHODS: We conducted an analysis of the claims from 3163 children with asthma enrolled in a university-based managed care organization from January 1998 to October 2000. We used logistic regression analysis to determine factors associated with an outpatient asthma visit with an allergist or pulmonologist. RESULTS: Of the 3163 patients, 443 (14%) had at least 1 subspecialist visit for asthma; 354 (80%) were seen by an allergist, 63 (14%) were seen by a pulmonologist, and 26 (6%) were seen by both. In multivariate analysis, patients with more severe asthma (odds ratio [OR], 3.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.99-4.86) and older patients (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07) were more likely to receive care from a subspecialist. Compared with Medicaid patients, both non-Medicaid patients with copayment (OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.85-4.43) and non-Medicaid patients without any copayment (OR, 3.40; 95% CI, 2.35-4.93) were more likely to receive care from an asthma subspecialist. CONCLUSIONS: Children insured by Medicaid are less likely to receive care from subspecialists for asthma. Reasons may be due to health care system-related factors, such as accessibility of subspecialists, to physician referral decisions, and/or to patient factors, such as adherence to recommendations to see a subspecialist. Our findings suggest a need to further investigate health care system barriers, physician referral, and patient acceptance and completion of subspecialty referral.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute asthma guidelines recommend that children with asthma receive spirometry testing "at least every 1 to 2 years to assess the maintenance of airway function." OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to describe: (1) how often children with asthma receive spirometry testing, (2) what factors are associated with receipt of spirometry testing, and (3) the impact of spirometry testing on subsequent emergency department visits for asthma. METHODS: We analyzed all pediatric asthma claims data from a university-based managed care organization for a 3-year period (January 2001 to December 2003). We included all of the continuously enrolled patients with active asthma between 7 and 21 years of age. Our outcomes of interest were the presence of > or = 1 claim for spirometry testing (Common Procedural Terminology 94010-6, 94060, 94070, or 94150) and the time to emergency department visit. We used multivariate logistic regression to determine factors associated with receipt of spirometry and survival analyses techniques to assess the association between receipt of spirometry with the likelihood of an emergency department asthma visit in the next year, controlling for patient age, gender, severity of illness, and type of insurance. RESULTS: There were 2688 eligible children of whom 1509 (56%) were male, 324 (12%) had Medicaid insurance, and 624 (24%) had persistent asthma in the initial year. Of the 2688 children, only 612 (23%) had > or = 1 claim for spirometry testing during the study period. In all of the multivariate logistic analysis models, increased severity of illness was consistently associated with increased likelihood of receiving spirometry testing. Compared with patients without Medicaid insurance, children with Medicaid insurance were consistently less likely to receive spirometry testing. After adjusting for age, gender, severity, and insurance type, receipt of spirometry did not affect the likelihood of future emergency department asthma use. CONCLUSIONS: Children with Medicaid insurance are less likely to receive spirometry testing. Reasons may be because of access to care, inadequate provider referral for testing, or patient preferences. Objective lung function tests, such as spirometry, are a potentially important component of monitoring chronic disease status. However, it is not clear whether spirometry testing by itself, completed every 1 to 2 years, helps prevent the likelihood of emergency department asthma visits. Compared with guideline recommendations, spirometry is underused; however, additional work is needed to understand how to best integrate such testing to improve asthma outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines recommend that patients receive a follow-up outpatient asthma visit after being discharged from an emergency department (ED) for asthma. OBJECTIVE: To measure the frequency of follow-up outpatient asthma visits and its association with repeat ED asthma visit. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children with asthma using claims data from a university-based managed care organization from January 1998 to October 2000. We performed a multivariate survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards model to determine the effect of follow-up outpatient asthma visits on the likelihood of a repeat ED asthma visit, after controlling for severity of illness, patient age, gender, insurance, and the specialty of the primary care provider. RESULTS: A total of 561 children had 780 ED asthma visits. Of these, 103 (17%) had a repeat ED asthma visit within 1 year. Almost two-thirds of children (66%) did not receive outpatient follow-up for asthma within 30 days of an ED asthma visit. Outpatient asthma visits within 30 days of an ED asthma visit are associated with an increased likelihood (relative risk = 1.80; 95% confidence interval 1.19, 2.72) for repeat ED asthma visits within 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients do not have outpatient follow-up after an ED asthma visit. However, those patients that present for outpatient follow-up have an increased likelihood for repeat ED asthma visits. For the primary care provider, these outpatient follow-up visits signal an increased risk that a patient will return to the ED for asthma and are a key opportunity to prevent future ED asthma visits.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Despite wide promulgation, clinical practice guidelines have had limited effect on changing physician behavior. Little is known about the process and factors involved in changing physician practices in response to guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To review barriers to physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines. DATA SOURCES: We searched the MEDLINE, Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), and HealthSTAR databases (January 1966 to January 1998); bibliographies; textbooks on health behavior or public health; and references supplied by experts to find English-language article titles that describe barriers to guideline adherence. STUDY SELECTION: Of 5658 articles initially identified, we selected 76 published studies describing at least 1 barrier to adherence to clinical practice guidelines, practice parameters, clinical policies, or national consensus statements. One investigator screened titles to identify candidate articles, then 2 investigators independently reviewed the texts to exclude articles that did not match the criteria. Differences were resolved by consensus with a third investigator. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators organized barriers to adherence into a framework according to their effect on physician knowledge, attitudes, or behavior. This organization was validated by 3 additional investigators. DATA SYNTHESIS: The 76 articles included 120 different surveys investigating 293 potential barriers to physician guideline adherence, including awareness (n = 46), familiarity(n = 31), agreement (n = 33), self-efficacy (n = 19), outcome expectancy (n = 8), ability to overcome the inertia of previous practice (n = 14), and absence of external barriers to perform recommendations (n = 34). The majority of surveys (70 [58%] of 120) examined only 1 type of barrier. CONCLUSIONS: Studies on improving physician guideline adherence may not be generalizable, since barriers in one setting may not be present in another. Our review offers a differential diagnosis for why physicians do not follow practice guidelines, as well as a rational approach toward improving guideline adherence and a framework for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the criteria for Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) with those of the European League Against Rheumatism/Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (EULAR/PRES) in a cohort of children with WG and other antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAVs), and to describe the interval to diagnosis, presenting features, and initial treatment for WG. METHODS: Eligible patients had been diagnosed by site rheumatologists (termed the "MD diagnosis") since 2004. This diagnosis was used as a reference standard for sensitivity and specificity testing of the 2 WG classification criteria. Descriptive analyses were confined to ACR-classified WG patients. RESULTS: MD diagnoses of 117 patients (82 of whom were female) were WG (n = 76), microscopic polyangiitis (n = 17), ANCA-positive pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (n = 5), Churg-Strauss syndrome (n = 2), and unclassified vasculitis (n = 17). The sensitivities of the ACR and EULAR/PRES classification criteria for WG among the spectrum of AAVs were 68.4% and 73.6%, respectively, and the specificities were 68.3% and 73.2%, respectively. Two more children were identified as having WG by the EULAR/PRES criteria than by the ACR criteria. For the 65 ACR-classified WG patients, the median age at diagnosis was 14.2 years (range 4-17 years), and the median interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was 2.7 months (range 0-49 months). The most frequent presenting features by organ system were constitutional (89.2%), pulmonary (80.0%), ear, nose, and throat (80.0%), and renal (75.4%). Fifty-four patients (83.1%) commenced treatment with the combination of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, with widely varying regimens; the remainder received methotrexate alone (n = 1), corticosteroids alone (n = 4), or a combination (n = 6). CONCLUSION: The EULAR/PRES criteria minimally improved diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for WG among a narrow spectrum of children with AAVs. Diagnostic delays may result from poor characterization of childhood WG. Initial therapy varied considerably among participating centers.},

  Abstract                 = {Syringomyelia is often associated with hydrocephalus, especially in Chiari malformations, but it has never been described as a complication of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus after preterm birth. We report on a premature infant who presented this exceptional association. He was born at 29 weeks of gestational age and suffered a grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage. Progressive ventricular dilatation developed despite repeated lumbar punctures, and a ventricular reservoir had to be inserted for cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Two weeks later he presented a flaccid, areflexic paralysis of his left upper limb. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a remarkable tetraventricular hydrocephalus and a cervical hydrosyringomyelia expanding from the C(5) to T(1) segments. After shunt surgery, the cephalic perimeter stabilized, and the infant began to move his arm. On follow-up, a minimal paresis of the left hand persisted. This case highlights an unreported outcome of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. In this context, syringomyelia should be included in the differential diagnosis of any infant with who presents segmental signs of acute or progressive onset.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To assess longitudinally children's motor performance 5 to 12 years after neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and to evaluate associations between clinical characteristics and motor performance. METHODS: Two hundred fifty-four neonatal ECMO survivors in the Netherlands were tested with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children at 5, 8, and/or 12 years. Percentile scores were transformed to z scores for longitudinal evaluation (norm population mean = 0 and SD = 1). Primary diagnoses: meconium aspiration syndrome (n = 137), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (n = 49), persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (n = 36), other diagnoses (n = 32). RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-six tests were analyzed. At 5, 8, and 12 years motor performance was normal in 73.7, 74.8, and 40.5%, respectively (vs 85% expected based on reference values; P < .001 at all ages). In longitudinal analyses mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) z scores were -0.42 (-0.55 to -0.28), -0.25 (-0.40 to -0.10) and -1.00 (-1.26 to -0.75) at 5, 8, and 12 years, respectively. Mean score at 8 years was significantly higher than at 5 years (difference 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.30), and mean score at 12 years was significantly lower than at both other ages (differences -0.59 and -0.75; 95% CI -0.33 to -0.84 and -0.49 to -1.00, respectively). Children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia encountered problems at all ages. The presence of chronic lung disease was negatively related with outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Motor problems in neonatal ECMO survivors persist throughout childhood and become more obvious with time.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that pediatric shock is a common cause of death and functional morbidity and that pediatric advanced life support (PALS)/advanced pediatric life support (APLS) resuscitation in the community hospital setting improves child health outcomes. METHODS: This study included all children consecutively transported to 5 regional, tertiary care children's hospitals over 4 years, and is a prospective cohort study comparing outcomes in children who did or did not receive PALS/APLS resuscitation in the community hospital. RESULTS: Shock occurred in 37% of the patients transferred to the tertiary centers. Regardless of trauma status, children with shock had an increased mortality rate compared with those without shock (all patients: 11.4% vs 2.6%), trauma patients (28.3% vs 1.2%), and nontrauma patients (10.5% vs 2.8%). Early shock reversal was associated with reduced mortality (5.06% vs 16.37%) and functional morbidity (1.56% vs 4.11%) rates. Early use of PALS/APLS-recommended interventions was associated with reduced mortality (8.69% vs 15.01%) and functional morbidity (1.24% vs 4.23%) rates. After controlling for center, severity of illness, and trauma status, early reversal of shock and use of PALS/APLS-recommended interventions remained associated with reduced morbidity and mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Shock is common in children who are transferred for tertiary care. Pediatric shock recognition and resuscitation in the community hospital improves survival and functional outcome regardless of diagnostic category. The development of shock/trauma systems for children with and without trauma seems prudent.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite implementation of CDC recommendations and bundled interventions for preventing catheter-associated blood stream infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or urinary catheter-associated infections, nosocomial infections and sepsis remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill children. Recent studies suggest that acquired critical illness stress-induced immune suppression (CRISIS) plays a role in the development of nosocomial infection and sepsis. This condition can be related to inadequate zinc, selenium, and glutamine levels, as well as hypoprolactinemia, leading to stress-induced lymphopenia, a predominant T(H)2 monocyte/macrophage state, and subsequent immune suppression. Prolonged immune dysfunction increases the likelihood of nosocomial infections associated with invasive devices. Although strategies to prevent common complications of critical illness are routinely employed (eg, prophylaxis for gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombophlebitis), no prophylactic strategy is used to prevent stress-induced immune suppression. This is the authors' rationale for the pediatric CRISIS prevention trial (NCT00395161), designed as a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical investigation to determine if daily enteral supplementation with zinc, selenium, and glutamine as well as parenteral metoclopramide (a dopamine 2 receptor antagonist that reverses hypoprolactinemia) prolongs the time until onset of nosocomial infection or sepsis in critically ill children compared to enteral supplementation with whey protein. If effective, this combined nutritional and pharmacologic approach may lessen the excess morbidity and mortality as well as resource utilization associated with nosocomial infections and sepsis in this population. The authors present the design and analytic plan for the CRISIS prevention trial.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The aim if the study was to investigate whether children born to older mothers have an increased risk of type 1 diabetes by performing a pooled analysis of previous studies using individual patient data to adjust for recognized confounders. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Relevant studies published before June 2009 were identified from MEDLINE, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Authors of studies were contacted and asked to provide individual patient data or conduct prespecified analyses. Risk estimates of type 1 diabetes by maternal age were calculated for each study, before and after adjustment for potential confounders. Meta-analysis techniques were used to derive combined odds ratios and to investigate heterogeneity among studies. RESULTS: Data were available for 5 cohort and 25 case-control studies, including 14,724 cases of type 1 diabetes. Overall, there was, on average, a 5% (95% CI 2-9) increase in childhood type 1 diabetes odds per 5-year increase in maternal age (P = 0.006), but there was heterogeneity among studies (heterogeneity I(2) = 70%). In studies with a low risk of bias, there was a more marked increase in diabetes odds of 10% per 5-year increase in maternal age. Adjustments for potential confounders little altered these estimates. CONCLUSIONS: There was evidence of a weak but significant linear increase in the risk of childhood type 1 diabetes across the range of maternal ages, but the magnitude of association varied between studies. A very small percentage of the increase in the incidence of childhood type 1 diabetes in recent years could be explained by increases in maternal age.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The incidence rates of childhood onset type 1 diabetes are almost universally increasing across the globe but the aetiology of the disease remains largely unknown. We investigated whether birth order is associated with the risk of childhood diabetes by performing a pooled analysis of previous studies. METHODS: Relevant studies published before January 2010 were identified from MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE. Authors of studies provided individual patient data or conducted pre-specified analyses. Meta-analysis techniques were used to derive combined odds ratios (ORs), before and after adjustment for confounders, and investigate heterogeneity. RESULTS: Data were available for 6 cohort and 25 case-control studies, including 11,955 cases of type 1 diabetes. Overall, there was no evidence of an association prior to adjustment for confounders. After adjustment for maternal age at birth and other confounders, a reduction in the risk of diabetes in second- or later born children became apparent [fully adjusted OR = 0.90 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-0.98; P = 0.02] but this association varied markedly between studies (I(2) = 67%). An a priori subgroup analysis showed that the association was stronger and more consistent in children < 5 years of age (n = 25 studies, maternal age adjusted OR = 0.84 95% CI 0.75, 0.93; I(2) = 23%). CONCLUSION: Although the association varied between studies, there was some evidence of a lower risk of childhood onset type 1 diabetes with increasing birth order, particularly in children aged < 5 years. This finding could reflect increased exposure to infections in early life in later born children.},

  Abstract                 = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We investigated whether children who are heavier at birth have an increased risk of type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Relevant studies published before February 2009 were identified from literature searches using MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE. Authors of all studies containing relevant data were contacted and asked to provide individual patient data or conduct pre-specified analyses. Risk estimates of type 1 diabetes by category of birthweight were calculated for each study, before and after adjustment for potential confounders.Meta-analysis techniques were then used to derive combined ORs and investigate heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: Data were available for 29 predominantly European studies (five cohort, 24 case-control studies), including 12,807 cases of type 1 diabetes. Overall, studies consistently demonstrated that children with birthweight from 3.5 to 4 kg had an increased risk of diabetes of 6% (OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.01-1.11]; p=0.02) and children with birthweight over 4 kg had an increased risk of 10% (OR 1.10 [95% CI 1.04-1.19]; p=0.003), compared with children weighing 3.0 to 3.5 kg at birth. This corresponded to a linear increase in diabetes risk of 3% per 500 g increase in birthweight (OR 1.03 [95% CI 1.00-1.06]; p=0.03). Adjustments for potential confounders such as gestational age, maternal age, birth order, Caesarean section, breastfeeding and maternal diabetes had little effect on these findings. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Children who are heavier at birth have a significant and consistent, but relatively small increase in risk of type 1 diabetes.},

  Abstract                 = {Drawing on several decades of work with families, pediatricians, other health care professionals, and policy makers, the American Academy of Pediatrics provides a definition of patient- and family-centered care. In pediatrics, patient- and family-centered care is based on the understanding that the family is the child's primary source of strength and support. Further, this approach to care recognizes that the perspectives and information provided by families, children, and young adults are essential components of high-quality clinical decision-making, and that patients and family are integral partners with the health care team. This policy statement outlines the core principles of patient- and family-centered care, summarizes some of the recent literature linking patient- and family-centered care to improved health outcomes, and lists various other benefits to be expected when engaging in patient- and family-centered pediatric practice. The statement concludes with specific recommendations for how pediatricians can integrate patient- and family-centered care in hospitals, clinics, and community settings, and in broader systems of care, as well.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for adjunctive therapies in sepsis that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and to improve outcome in severe sepsis. DESIGN: The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. METHODS: The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591. CONCLUSION: Glycemic control (maintenance of glucose <150 mg/dL) is recommended. The beneficial effect of glycemic control appears to be related control of glucose and not the administration of insulin. Glycemic control should be combined with a nutritional protocol. The dialysis dose is important in sepsis-induced acute renal failure. Continuous hemofiltration offers easier management of fluid balance in hemodynamically unstable septic patients but in the absence of hemodynamic instability is equivalent to intermittent hemodialysis. It is uncertain whether high-volume hemofiltration improves prognosis in sepsis. Bicarbonate therapy is not recommended for the purpose of improving hemodynamics or reducing vasopressor requirements in the presence of lactic academia and pH >7.15.},

  Abstract                 = {The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) is commonly used to score injury severity and describe types of injuries. In 2005, the AIS-Head section was revised to capture more detailed information about head injuries and to better reflect their clinical severity, but the impact of these changes is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare AIS-1998 and AIS-2005 coding of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) using medical records at a single Level I trauma center. We included patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale 3-8) after blunt injury, excluding those who were missing medical records. Detailed descriptions of injuries were collected, then manually coded into AIS-1998 and AIS-2005 by the same Certified AIS Specialist. Compared to AIS-1998, AIS-2005 coded the same injuries with lower severity scores [p<0.01] and with decreased mean and maximum AIS-Head scores [p<0.01]. Of the types of traumatic brain injuries, most of the changes occurred among cerebellar and cerebral injuries. Traumatic hypoxic brain injury secondary to systemic dysfunction was captured by AIS-2005 but not by AIS-1998. However, AIS-2005 captured fewer loss of consciousness cases due to changes in criteria for coding concussive injury. In conclusion, changes from AIS-1998 to AIS-2005 result in significant differences in severity scores and types of injuries captured. This may complicate future TBI research by precluding direct comparison to datasets using AIS-1998. TBIs should be coded into the same AIS-version for comparison or evaluation of trends, and specify which AIS-version is used.},

METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR sequencing methods were utilized to test the presence of HCMV in pouch specimens taken from 34 patients in 86 endoscopies. RESULTS: HCMV genes and proteins were detected in samples from 12 (35.2%) patients. The rate of detection was significant in the endoscopies from patients diagnosed with pouchitis (5 of 12, 41.6%), according to the Japanese classification of pouchitis, in comparison to patients with normal pouch (7 of 62, 11.2%; P = 0.021). In all patients with pouchitis in which the HCMV was detected, it was the first episode of pouchitis. The virus was not detected in previous biopsies taken in normal endoscopies of these patients. During the follow-up, HCMV was detected in one patient with recurrent pouchitis and in 3 patients whose pouchitis episodes improved but whose positive endoscopic findings persisted. CONCLUSION: HCMV can take part in the inflammatory process of the pouch in some patients with ulcerative colitis who have undergone proctocolectomy with IPAA.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Although analysis of functional independence measures (FIM) at discharge are useful for assessing extent of disability in head-injured children, there is no reliable method to predict the severity of disability at the time of admission. The authors developed a novel method to predict severe disability after head trauma on admission. METHODS: Head-injured patients, 2 to 16 years old, with FIM recorded at discharge (n = 3,491) were identified in our state trauma database for the period from 1993 through 1996. Patients categorized as completely dependent by one or more of the FIM (Feeding, Locomotion, Expression, Transfer Mobility, Social Interaction) were classified as disabled. Probability of disability (P(D)) was estimated based on regression weights for Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), age, and number of anatomic regions injured. Observed to expected disability rates were compared using a test data set of 2,553 patients entered in the database between 1997 through 1999. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between observed and expected disability across all P(D) intervals, which suggests that the P(D) accurately predicted disability. CONCLUSIONS: P(D) offers a novel and reliable method for early prediction of likelihood of disability in children who sustain head trauma. Routine use of the P(D) may lead to earlier intervention to improve long-term results in head-injured children.},

  Abstract                 = {In an effort to attain earlier diagnoses in children with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), the International Histiocyte Society has now broadened their diagnostic criteria to no longer differentiate primary (HLH) and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (SHLH). Five of the following eight diagnostic criteria needed to be met: 1) fever, 2) cytopenia of two lines, 3) hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, 4) hyperferritinemia (>500 microg/L), 5) hemophagocytosis, 6) elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor (CD25), 7) decreased natural killer-cell activity, and 8) splenomegaly can also commonly be found in patients with sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Nevertheless, the therapeutic options for these are radically different. Chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant have been used for treatment of HLH/SHLH, whereas antibiotics and supportive treatment are used in severe sepsis/SIRS and MODS. MAS is treated with limited immune suppression. Outcomes are also different, SHLH has a mortality rate around 50%, whereas pediatric septic shock and MODS have a mortality of 10.3% and 18%, respectively, and severe sepsis in previously healthy children has a mortality rate of 2%. MAS has a mortality rate between 8% and 22%. Because SHLH and severe sepsis/SIRS/MODS/MAS share clinical and laboratory inflammatory phenotypes, we recommend extreme caution when considering applying HLH therapies to children with sepsis/SIRS/MODS/MAS. HLH therapies are clearly warranted for children with HLH; however, a quantitative functional estimate of cytotoxic lymphocyte function may be a more precise approach to define the overlap of these conditions, better identify these processes, and develop novel therapeutic protocols that may lead to improved treatments and outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Ablation of renal tissue in infancy is followed by increased ultrafiltration pressure, enlarged filtering area and decreased hydraulic conductivity of the glomerular capillaries. This study examines the effect of a calcium channel blocker, felodipine, on ultrafiltration pressure and renal function in rats uni-nephrectomized at 5 days of age. The rats were treated with felodipine from 24 to 60 days of age or left untreated. Sham-operated untreated rats were used as controls. Arterial blood pressure levels were similar in the three groups of rats. Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow in the left kidney were significantly higher in treated and untreated rats than in sham-operated untreated rats; significantly higher values were also found in treated than in untreated rats. Single nephron glomerular filtration rate was significantly higher in treated and in untreated than in sham-operated untreated rats, but was not different in treated and untreated rats. Ultrafiltration pressure was significantly higher in untreated rats than in treated and in sham-operated untreated rats. Ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf) was significantly higher in treated rats than in untreated and sham-operated untreated rats. Hydrolic conductivity of the glomerular capillaries was significantly lower in untreated than in treated and in sham-operated rats, but was not different in treated and sham-operated rats. Glomerular volume was higher in treated and untreated rats than in sham-operated rats. Conclusion: high ultrafiltration pressure is not an absolute requirement for the hyperfiltration that follows infant nephrectomy.},

  Abstract                 = {The PI3K/AKT pathway is hyperactivated in prostate cancer but its effective therapeutic targeting has proven difficult. In particular, the antitumor activity of AKT inhibitors is attenuated by upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) through an uncharacterized feedback mechanism. In this report, we show that RNA interference-mediated silencing or pharmacologic inhibition of Pim-1 activity curtails AKT inhibitor-induced upregulation of RTKs in prostate cancer cells. Although Pim kinases have been implicated in cap-dependent translational control, we find that in the context of AKT inhibition, the expression of RTKs is controlled by Pim-1 in a cap-independent manner by controlling internal ribosome entry. Combination of Pim and AKT inhibitors resulted in synergistic inhibition of prostate tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Together, our results show that Pim-1 mediates resistance to AKT inhibition and suggest its targeting to improve the efficacy of AKT inhibitors in anticancer therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Assess outcome in children treated with inotrope, vasopressor, and/or vasodilator therapy for reversal of fluid-refractory and persistent septic shock. DESIGN: Survey; case series. SETTING: Three pediatric hospitals. PATIENTS: Fifty consecutive patients with fluid-refractory septic shock with a pulmonary artery catheter within 6 hours of resuscitation. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were categorized according to hemodynamic state and use of inotrope, vasopressor, and/or vasodilator therapy to maintain cardiac index (CI) >3.3 L/min/m2 and systemic vascular resistance >800 dyne-sec/cm/m to reverse shock. OUTCOME MEASURES: Hemodynamic state, response to class of cardiovascular therapy, and mortality. RESULTS: After fluid resuscitation, 58% of the children had a low CI and responded to inotropic therapy with or without a vasodilator (group I), 20% had a high CI and low systemic vascular resistance and responded to vasopressor therapy alone (group II), and 22% had both vascular and cardiac dysfunction and responded to combined vasopressor and inotropic therapy (group III). Shock persisted in 36% of the children. Of the children in group I, 50% needed the addition of a vasodilator, and in group II, 50% of children needed the addition of an inotrope for evolving myocardial dysfunction. Four children showed a complete change in hemodynamic state and responded to a switch from inotrope to vasopressor therapy or vice versa. The overall 28-day survival rate was 80% (group I, 72%; group II, 90%; group III, 91%). CONCLUSIONS: Unlike adults, children with fluid-refractory shock are frequently hypodynamic and respond to inotrope and vasodilator therapy. Because hemodynamic states are heterogeneous and change with time, an incorrect cardiovascular therapeutic regimen should be suspected in any child with persistent shock. Outcome can be improved compared with historical literature.},

The authors simulated a cohort study and performed 252,480 trials. In the logistic regression, the bias decreased as the number of events per confounder increased. In the propensity score, the bias decreased as the strength of the association of the exposure with the outcome increased. Propensity scores produced estimates that were less biased, more robust, and more precise than the logistic regression estimates when there were seven or fewer events per confounder. The logistic regression empirical coverage probability increased as the number of events per confounder increased. The propensity score empirical coverage probability decreased after eight or more events per confounder. Overall, the propensity score exhibited more empirical power than logistic regression. Propensity scores are a good alternative to control for imbalances when there are seven or fewer events per confounder; however, empirical power could range from 35% to 60%. Logistic regression is the technique of choice when there are at least eight events per confounder.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To compare "central venous pressure" in pediatric patients in a clinical setting as measured from catheters in the infrahepatic inferior vena cava and the right atrium. DESIGN: Prospective, unblinded study. SETTING: Cardiothoracic intensive care unit of a tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-three pediatric cardiac surgical patients, 2 days to 92 months of age (mean 24 +/- 4 months). INTERVENTIONS: All patients had intraoperative placement of an 8-cm, double-lumen, femoral venous catheter and a transthoracic right atrial catheter. Patients were studied for 0 to 2 days after surgery. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Measurements were obtained during mechanical and spontaneous ventilation. Although not statistically identical, measurements of "central" venous pressure in the inferior vena cava and right atrium correlated well (r2 = .87 for mechanical ventilation; r2 = .83 for spontaneous ventilation). Of 31 data pairs in mechanically ventilated patients, the absolute difference in pressures was as large as 3 mm Hg in three patients and <3 mm Hg in all the rest. In 15 spontaneously breathing patients, there were only three data measurements where the difference in pressure was 2 mm Hg and none of the differences was greater. In spontaneously breathing patients, the phasic changes due to respiratory variations in venous pressure were in phase in both the intrathoracic and intra-abdominal catheter positions. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that while "central" venous pressures measured in the inferior vena cava and in the right atrium are not statistically identical, any differences are well within clinically important limits. Placement of central venous pressure catheters in the inferior vena cava by the femoral venous approach is a reliable alternative to cannulating the superior vena cava in pediatric patients without clinically important intra-abdominal pathology and with anatomic continuity of the inferior vena cava with the right atrium. Relatively short femoral vein catheters allow adequate measurement of central venous pressure without concern for exact catheter tip position and without the risk of right atrial perforation, intracardiac arrhythmias, and inadvertent puncture of carotid and intrathoracic structures. Unlike previously reported results in neonates, we found that the phasic changes of venous pressure with the respiratory cycle were similar in both intrathoracic and intra-abdominal recordings, making this an inappropriate clinical indicator of venous catheter tip position.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The principal strategy for managing head injury is to reduce the frequency and severity of secondary brain insults from intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and hence improve outcome. Precise critical threshold levels have not been determined in head injured children. OBJECTIVE: To create a novel pressure-time index (PTI) measuring both duration and amplitude of insult, and then employ it to determine critical insult thresholds of ICP and CPP in children. METHODS: Prospective, observational, physiologically based study from Edinburgh and Newcastle, using patient monitored blood pressure, ICP, and CPP time series data. The PTI for ICP and CPP for 81 children, using theoretical values derived from physiological norms, was varied systematically to derive critical insult thresholds which delineate Glasgow outcome scale categories. RESULTS: The PTI for CPP had a very high predictive value for outcome (receiver operating characteristic analyses: area under curve = 0.957 and 0.890 for mortality and favourable outcome, respectively) and was more predictive than for ICP. Initial physiological values most accurately predicted favourable outcome. The CPP critical threshold values determined for children aged 2-6, 7-10, and 11-15 years were 48, 54, and 58 mm Hg. respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The PTI is the first substantive paediatric index of total ICP and CPP following head injury. The insult thresholds generated are identical to age related physiological values. Management guidelines for paediatric head injuries should take account of these CPP thresholds to titrate appropriate pressor therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Severe head injury in childhood is associated with considerable mortality and morbidity. In this study we determined age-related differences in the relationship between outcome and intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in the first 6 h of monitoring in a large cohort of head-injured children. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-five head-injured children (admitted to five UK hospitals over a 15-year period) in whom intracranial pressure monitoring was clinically indicated were studied. RESULTS: Patients were divided into three age groups (2-6, 7-10 and 11-16 years). The sensitivity of ICP and CPP were similar. Differences were found in the specificity of ICP and CPP for each group and these were more marked for CPP. For a specificity of 50% the pressures were 53, 63 and 66 mmHg for the three age groups. CONCLUSIONS: There are age-related differences in the specificity of intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure in relation to outcome. These differences may be important in the clinical management of head-injured children. Thus cerebral perfusion pressures of 53, 63 and 66 mmHg should be the minimum to strive for in these three age groups respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECT: Intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) are frequently monitored in severely head injured patients. To establish which one (ICP or CPP) is more predictive of outcome and to examine whether there are significant threshold levels in the determination of outcome, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze data in a large series of head-injured patients. METHODS: Data were obtained from a total of 291 severely head injured patients (207 adults and 84 children). Outcome was categorized as either independent (good recovery or moderate disability) or poor (severely disabled, vegetative, or dead) by using the Glasgow Outcome Scale; patients were also grouped according to the Marshall computerized tomography scan classification. CONCLUSIONS: The maximum value of a 2-minute rolling average of ICP readings (defined as ICPmax) and the minimum value of the CPP readings (CPPmin) were then used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the ROC curves over a range of values. Using ROC curves, a threshold value for CPPmin of 55 mm Hg and for ICPmax of 35 mm Hg appear to be the best predictors in adults. For children the levels appear to be 43 to 45 mm Hg for CPPmin and 35 mm Hg for ICPmax. Higher levels of CPPmin seem important in adults with mass lesions. These CPP thresholds (45 mm Hg for children and 55 mm Hg for adults) are lower than previously predicted and may be clinically important, especially in children, in whom a lower blood pressure level is normal. Also, CPP management at higher levels may be more important in adults with mass lesions. A larger observational series would improve the accuracy of these predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {Transcranial doppler measurements of blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery were made during treatment of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in 22 patients with severe brain injury. Twenty patients also had continuous measurement of arterial and jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation (SJO2). The transcranial Doppler parameters studied included both mean flow velocity and pulsatility index (PI). Successful treatment was defined as a reduction of ICP to less than 20 mm Hg with improvement or preservation of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) above 60 mm Hg. Successful therapy was associated with a significant rise in SJO2 and reduction of cerebral arteriovenous oxygen content difference (AVDO2) and PI only when the pretreatment CPP was less than 60 mm Hg. An increase in CPP beyond 70 mm Hg did not further improve cerebral oxygen delivery and PI, suggesting that autoregulation became a factor above this CPP threshold. Treatment failure during administration of hypnotic drugs resulted in a reduction in arterial pressure, CPP, SJO2, and mean velocity and in an increase in PI and AVDO2, despite a decrease in ICP. CPP is the most important parameter to monitor during ICP therapy. It should be maintained above 70 mm Hg in patients with severe brain injury.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated survival and predictors of mortality for infants and children with heart disease treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as an aid to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS: Children (<18 years) with heart disease who received extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation and were reported to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization database were evaluated. Patients were classified into one of 3 groups based on underlying cardiac physiology: single ventricle, 2 ventricles, and cardiac muscle disease. Patients with eligible procedure codes were assigned a Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery-1 classification. RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-two patients were eligible for analysis, and 279 (57%) were assigned a Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery-1 category. Overall survival was 42%. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, significant pre-extracorporeal predictors for mortality included single-ventricle physiology (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.4), a history of a stage 1-type procedure (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.2), and extreme acidosis (arterial blood gas pH < 7.01; odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.7). Right carotid artery cannulation was associated with decreased mortality risk (odds ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-0.9). During extracorporeal support, complications, including renal injury, evidence of neurologic injury, and persistent acidosis, were associated with an increased risk of hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as an adjunct to cardiopulmonary resuscitation resulted in hospital survival in 42% of infants and children with heart disease. Underlying cardiac physiology and associated cardiac surgical procedures influenced mortality, as did pre-extracorporeal resuscitation status and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-associated complications.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: To compare the management cost and cost-effectiveness of dabigatran with warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) from the hospital's and patients' perspectives. HYPOTHESIS: Dabigatran is more cost-effective than warfarin for stroke prevention of AF in Hong Kong. METHODS: The analysis was performed in conjunction with a drug utilization evaluation of dabigatran study in a teaching hospital in Hong Kong. The study recruited 244 patients who received either dabigatran or warfarin for stroke prevention of AF. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed and was expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in averting a cardiac event or a bleeding event. A sensitivity analysis was used on all relevant variables to test the robustness. RESULTS: From the hospital's perspective, the dabigatran group had a lower total cost of management than that of the warfarin group (median: US$421 vs US$1306, P < 0.001) (US$1 = HK$7.75) and was dominant over warfarin. From the patients' perspective, the total cost of management in the dabigatran group was higher than that in warfarin group (median: US$1751 vs US$70, P < 0.001), and the ICER in preventing a cardiac or bleeding event of dabigatran vs warfarin was estimated at US$68 333 and US$20 500, respectively. If dabigatran was subsidized by the hospital, a higher cost would be incurred by the hospital (median: US$1679 vs US$1306, ICER (cardiac and bleeding events): US$15 163 and US$4549, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The study favored dabigatran for stroke prophylaxis in patients with nonvalvular AF in Hong Kong under the current hospital's perspective and provided a reference for further comparisons under patient and subsidization perspectives.},

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the feasibility of using mobile workforce technology to validate the locations of automated external defibrillators (AEDs), an emergency public health resource. METHODS: We piloted the use of a mobile workforce application, to verify the location of 40 AEDs in Philadelphia county. AEDs were pre-identified in public locations for baseline data. The task of locating AEDs was posted online for a mobile workforce from October 2011 to January 2012. Participants were required to submit a mobile phone photo of AEDs and descriptions of the location. RESULTS: Thirty-five of the 40 AEDs were identified within the study period. Most, 91% (32/35) of the submitted AED photo information was confirmed project baseline data. Participants also provided additional data such as business hours and other nearby AEDs.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with plating is a common procedure performed for cervical spondylosis by spine surgeons. However, data on procedures involving 4 disc spaces are lacking. We report the outcomes of patients who underwent 4-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with plating at a single institution. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2006, 34 patients (19 females, 15 males; mean age, 58 years; age range, 38-83 years) underwent 4-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with plating based on a surgical database search. Only patients undergoing surgery at 4 contiguous disc levels were included. Data were collected in a retrospective fashion. Patients' demographics, symptoms, neurologic findings, and radiographic findings at admission were recorded. Long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes at last follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (85%) underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with plating at C3-C7. Sixteen patients presented with neurologic deficits, of which 14 (88%) improved. None worsened after surgery. Minor complications occurred in 26 patients, including transient dysphagia in 18 (53%) and hoarseness in 3 (9%). Radiographic outcomes were available in 27 patients (median follow-up, 15 months; range, 4-71 months). The overall fusion rate was 92.6%. Stable fibrous nonunions were present in 2 patients; the chance of nonunion was 1.9% per level and 7% per patient. Adjacent-level disease occurred in 2 patients. CONCLUSION: In carefully selected patients, 4-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with plating can be associated with high rates of fusion. The technique is safe and effective for managing multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy and may obviate the need for circumferential procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To describe volatile anesthesia (VA) use for pediatric asthma, including complications and outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Children's hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information System between 2004-2008. PATIENTS: Children 2-18 years old with a primary diagnosis code for asthma supported with mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTION: Those treated with VA were compared to those not treated with VA or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Hospital VA use was grouped as none, <5%, 5-10% and >10% among intubated children. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One thousand five hundred and fifty-eight patients received mechanical ventilation at 40 hospitals for asthma: 47 (3%) received VA treatment at 11 (28%) hospitals. Those receiving a VA were significantly less likely to receive inhaled b-agonists, ipratropium bromide, and heliox, but more likely to receive neuromuscular blocking agents than patients treated without VA. Length of mechanical ventilation, hospital stay (length of stay [LOS]) and charges were significantly greater for those treated with VA. Aspiration was more common but death and air leak did not differ. Patients at hospitals with VA use >10% were significantly less likely to receive inhaled b agonist, ipratropium bromide, methylxanthines, and heliox, but more likely to receive systemic b agonist, neuromuscular blocking agents compared to those treated at hospitals not using VA. LOS, duration of ventilation, and hospital charges were significantly greater for patients treated at centers with high VA use. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality does not differ between centers that use VA or not. Patients treated at centers with high VA use had significantly increased hospital charges and increased LOS.},

  Abstract                 = {Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) continues to complicate the course of 8 to 28% of patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV). In contrast to infections of more frequently involved organs (e.g., urinary tract and skin), for which mortality is low, ranging from 1 to 4%, the mortality rate for VAP ranges from 24 to 50% and can reach 76% in some specific settings or when lung infection is caused by high-risk pathogens. The predominant organisms responsible for infection are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae, but etiologic agents widely differ according to the population of patients in an intensive care unit, duration of hospital stay, and prior antimicrobial therapy. Because appropriate antimicrobial treatment of patients with VAP significantly improves outcome, more rapid identification of infected patients and accurate selection of antimicrobial agents represent important clinical goals. Our personal bias is that using bronchoscopic techniques to obtain protected brush and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from the affected area in the lung permits physicians to devise a therapeutic strategy that is superior to one based only on clinical evaluation. When fiberoptic bronchoscopy is not available to physicians treating patients clinically suspected of having VAP, we recommend using either a simplified nonbronchoscopic diagnostic procedure or following a strategy in which decisions regarding antibiotic therapy are based on a clinical score constructed from seven variables. Selection of the initial antimicrobial therapy should be based on predominant flora responsible for VAP at each institution, clinical setting, information provided by direct examination of pulmonary secretions, and intrinsic antibacterial activities of antimicrobial agents and their pharmacokinetic characteristics. Further trials will be needed to clarify the optimal duration of treatment and the circumstances in which monotherapy can be safely used.},

  Abstract                 = {The Swan-Ganz balloon flotation catheter was introduced in 1970. It can be placed at the bedside within a few minutes even in critically ill patients. Although placement of these catheters is not difficult, some training and experience are required to avoid complications and for proper interpretation of the hemodynamic data that can be obtained by pulmonary artery catheterization. Because of the many advantages of balloon flotation catheters compared with conventional catheters, they have been used without a proper indication and frequently overused in critical care units, resulting in many complications, including mortality. The prospective randomized trials have reported that in the majority of clinical circumstances, the routine use of balloon flotation catheters is not indicated. These results are not surprising because balloon flotation catheters are diagnostic and not therapeutic tools. That we have learned a great deal about hemodynamics in critically ill patients with the use of balloon flotation catheters should not be ignored or forgotten. Furthermore, our clinical knowledge of hemodynamics has been made possible because of extensive experience gained from directly determined hemodynamics with the use of balloon flotation catheters. It should also be realized that despite the introduction and refinement of newer noninvasive imaging modalities, a number of clinical circumstances exist in which determination of hemodynamics with the use of a balloon flotation catheter is necessary and should be considered, but only by experienced physicians. With the proper use of Swan-Ganz catheters, our knowledge of hemodynamics has been enhanced considerably. Its abuse, particularly by relatively inexperienced operators, has resulted in serious complications, including death. Prospective randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that the routine use of Swan-Ganz catheters does not provide any benefit. However, use of the Swan-Ganz catheter is still indicated in many situations.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: We analyze the effect of surgical case volume on the survival of infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who underwent stage I surgical palliation (the Norwood procedure). The purpose of our study was to understand more clearly the relative effects of institution and surgeon experience on patient outcome. METHODS: Using the Pediatric Health Information System database belonging to the pediatric hospital members of the Child Health Corporation of America, we identified newborn infants (< 30 days old on admission) from 1998 through 2001 admitted with the diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to examine the association between both institutional and surgeon case volume with 28-day survival after the Norwood procedure. RESULTS: Twenty-nine hospitals and 87 surgeons performed 801 Norwood procedures during the study period. In the 4 of 29 institutions that averaged 1 or more Norwood procedures per month during the study period, survival averaged 78%. The remaining 25 institutions averaged 1 Norwood procedure every 9.6 weeks, with a survival of 59%. Data analysis revealed that higher institutional volume (P = .02) but not the number of cases performed by surgeons (P = .13) increased survival after the Norwood procedure. There was no such association with average length of stay in survivors or the time to mortality in nonsurvivors. CONCLUSION: Survival after the Norwood procedure is associated with institutional Norwood procedure volume but not with individual surgeon case volume, suggesting the need for improvements in institutional-based approaches to the care of children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and the need for establishing regional referral centers for such high-risk procedures to improve patient survival.},

  Abstract                 = {No one set of characteristics has been consistently predictive of perioperative mortality and morbidity associated with the Norwood procedure. The purpose of the current study is to further validate a scoring system shown to be predictive of mortality following the Norwood procedure. We performed a retrospective review of all infants with the diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) who underwent the Norwood procedure at St. Louis Children's Hospital from July 1, 1994, to December 31, 2002. A weighted score for each of six factors comprised the scoring system. The factors included ventricular function, tricuspid regurgitation, ascending aortic diameter, atrial septal defect blood flow characteristics, blood type, and age. A score of > or = 7 points indicated lower reconstructive mortality risk, and a total score of < 7 points indicated a higher mortality risk. A total of 57 patients were analyzed. Twenty-five infants (44%) had a low risk score. These infants had a significantly greater survival at 48 hours compared to infants with a score of < 7 (92 vs 75%, p < 0.05). Infants with a high risk score had a significantly greater relative risk of mortality at 48 hours [OR = 2.04; confidence interval (CI) 1.04-4.00; p = 0.036]. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is 0.8534 (95% CI, 0.78-0.922). This suggests that the scoring system has a very good degree of discriminatory power in selecting children who did not survive. Based on the results of the ROC, a cutoff score of >7 gives the best sensitivity and specificity for survival. When applied retrospectively, the survival outcomes predicted by our scoring system significantly correlated with actual outcomes. This supports the conclusion that a specific population of HLHS patients may have a higher mortality risk independent of surgical technique and postoperative care based on factors that can be assessed preoperatively.},

  Abstract                 = {The photophysical properties of a polymer of intrinsic microporosity, namely, PIM-1, were characterized by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence for solutions of PIM-1 in dichloromethane (DCM) or for a membrane made of PIM-1 immersed in hexane to which a quencher was added. Quenching of PIM-1 by the proton-donor trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), electron-rich tributylamine (TBA), and electron-poor nitromethane (CH3NO2) was investigated and compared to those of the structural unit of PIM-1, the model compound M-1. Only TBA and TFA appeared to quench PIM-1 effectively. The sensitivity of monomer M-1 to the nature of the solvent led us to investigate how addition of a quencher would affect the fluorescence of the polymer PIM-1. Solvent effects were observed for TFA only and were carefully characterized. In particular, it was determined that these solvent effects could be neglected for TFA concentrations smaller than 1.4 mM. Quenching of PIM-1 by TBA was diffusional in nature and occurred in a similar manner for M-1 and PIM-1 in DCM, suggesting that M-1 is locally excited in PIM-1. All M-1 units were accessible and quenched effectively by TBA for PIM-1 in DCM and the PIM-1 membrane in hexane. Quenching of PIM-1 in DCM and in the membrane was more complex, showing a combination of static, diffusive, and protective quenching. The fraction of accessible M-1 units to TFA (f(a)) was determined to be equal to 0.5 for PIM-1 in DCM or in the membrane. The TBA and TFA quenching experiments led to the conclusion that the same accessibility was obtained for the fluorescent constituting units of PIM-1 dissolved in DCM or in a membrane immersed in hexane, in agreement with the known high microporosity of this polymer.},

But he developed respiratory failure, seizure, and cardiac arrest, and died. This case is unique for developing hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis at the initiation of Kawasaki disease, with fatal outcome. This case may indicate a yet unknown mechanism triggers these 2 diseases; a specific Th1/Th2 cytokine pattern helps rapid differential diagnosis between these 2 diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {As triage and resuscitation protocols evolve, it is critical to determine the major extracranial variables influencing outcome in the setting of severe head injury. We prospectively studied the outcome from severe head injury (GCS score < or = 8) in 717 cases in the Traumatic Coma Data Bank. We investigated the impact on outcome of hypotension (SBP < 90 mm Hg) and hypoxia (Pao2 < or = 60 mm Hg or apnea or cyanosis in the field) as secondary brain insults, occurring from injury through resuscitation. Hypoxia and hypotension were independently associated with significant increases in morbidity and mortality from severe head injury. Hypotension was profoundly detrimental, occurring in 34.6% of these patients and associated with a 150% increase in mortality. The increased morbidity and mortality related to severe trauma to an extracranial organ system appeared primarily attributable to associated hypotension. Improvements in trauma care delivery over the past decade have not markedly altered the adverse influence of hypotension. Hypoxia and hypotension are common and detrimental secondary brain insults. Hypotension, particularly, is a major determinant of outcome from severe head injury. Resuscitation protocols for brain injured patients should assiduously avoid hypovolemic shock on an absolute basis.},

  Abstract                 = {The outcome from severe head injury (GCS < or = 8 mmHg) was prospectively studied in patients from the Traumatic Coma Data Bank. We investigated the impact on outcome of hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) occurring from injury through resuscitation (early hypotension; N = 717) or in the Intensive Care Unit [ICU] (late hypotension; N = 493). Early hypotension occurred in 248 patients (34.6%) and was associated with a doubling of mortality (55% vs. 27%). If shock was present on admission, the mortality was 65%. These effects were independent of age, admission GCS motor score, presence of hypoxia, or associated severe extracranial trauma, suggesting that the influence of multiple system trauma in head injured patients is primarily due to associated hypotension. Late hypotension occurred in 156 of 493 patients (32%) and was the only hypotensive episode in 117 (24%). For 117 patients whose only hypotensive episode occurred in the ICU, 66% either died or were vegetative survivors, compared to 17% of patients who never suffered an hypotensive episode. Logistic regression modelling suggested that early and late shock were the most powerful independent predictors of mortality in this group of patients. These data demonstrate that hypotension is a common and devastating secondary brain insult in severe head injury patients, occurring not only during transport and resuscitation but also "right under our noses" in the ICU. We suggest that vigorous attention to eliminate or minimize such insults has the potential of markedly improving outcome from severe head injury.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The goals of this study were to determine the incidence and duration of hypotension and hypoxia in the prehospital setting in patients with potentially survivable brain injuries, and to prospectively examine the association of these secondary insults with mortality and disability at hospital discharge. METHODS: Trauma patients with suspected brain injuries underwent continuous blood pressure and pulse oximetry monitoring during helicopter transport. Postadmission inclusion criteria were (1) diagnosis of acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan, operative findings, or autopsy findings; and (2) Head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of > or = 3 or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of < or = 12 within the first 24 hours of admission. Patients were excluded with (1) no abnormal intracranial findings on the patient's CT scan; (2) determination of a nonsurvivable injury (based on an AIS score of 6 for any body region; or, (3) death in less than 12 hours after injury. Primary outcome measures included mortality and Disability Rating Scale score at discharge. RESULTS: We enrolled 150 patients into the study. Fifty-seven patients had at least one secondary insult; 37 had only hypoxic episodes, 14 had only hypotensive episodes, and 6 patients had both. Demographics and injury characteristics did not differ between those with and those without secondary insults. The mortality for patients without secondary insults was 20%, compared with 37% for patients with hypoxic episodes, 8% for patients with hypotensive episodes, and 24% for patients with both. The Disability Rating Scale score at discharge was significantly higher in patients with secondary insults. Using multivariate analysis, the calculated odds ratio of mortality caused by prehospital hypoxia after head injury was 2.66 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Secondary insults after TBI are common, and these insults are associated with disability. Hypoxia in the prehospital setting significantly increases the odds of mortality after brain injury controlled for multiple variables.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Inadequate oxygen (hypoxia) triggers a multifaceted cellular response that has important roles in normal physiology and in many human diseases. A transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), plays a central role in the hypoxia response; its activity is regulated by the oxygen-dependent degradation of the HIF-1alpha protein. Despite the ubiquity and importance of hypoxia responses, little is known about the variation in the global transcriptional response to hypoxia among different cell types or how this variation might relate to tissue- and cell-specific diseases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed the temporal changes in global transcript levels in response to hypoxia in primary renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, breast epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells with DNA microarrays. The extent of the transcriptional response to hypoxia was greatest in the renal tubule cells. This heightened response was associated with a uniquely high level of HIF-1alpha RNA in renal cells, and it could be diminished by reducing HIF-1alpha expression via RNA interference. A gene-expression signature of the hypoxia response, derived from our studies of cultured mammary and renal tubular epithelial cells, showed coordinated variation in several human cancers, and was a strong predictor of clinical outcomes in breast and ovarian cancers. In an analysis of a large, published gene-expression dataset from breast cancers, we found that the prognostic information in the hypoxia signature was virtually independent of that provided by the previously reported wound signature and more predictive of outcomes than any of the clinical parameters in current use. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptional response to hypoxia varies among human cells. Some of this variation is traceable to variation in expression of the HIF1A gene. A gene-expression signature of the cellular response to hypoxia is associated with a significantly poorer prognosis in breast and ovarian cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Hypoxia is an important topic both physiologically and clinically. Traditionally, physiology research has been focusing on the effect of acute and chronic sustained hypoxia and human adaptive response to high altitude. In the past 20 years, genetic studies by many have expanded our understanding of hypoxia to the molecular level. However, in contrast to our extensive knowledge about acute and chronic sustained hypoxia, we know relatively little about the effect of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). In recent years, CIH has attracted more research attention because of the increasing prevalence of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the western countries. Clinically, CIH is commonly seen in patients with sleep-disordered breathing including OSA, Cheyne-Stokes respiration and nocturnal hypoventilation. It was estimated that for OSA of at least mild severity prevalence estimates range from 3 to 28% in the general population. OSA is characterized by recurrent upper airway collapse during sleep leading to intermittent nocturnal hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. OSA is associated with significant mortality and morbidity including neurocognitive dysfunction, hypertension, many cardiovascular disorders and metabolic disorders such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The intermittent hypoxia in OSA closely mimics what is seen in the ischemia-reperfusion injury. Experimentally, there is no universally accepted definition for CIH. Laboratory protocols vary greatly in duration of hypoxia exposure, numbers of hypoxia episodes per day and the total number of days of exposure. Despite the lack of a uniform definition, recent data suggest that CIH may lead to multiple long-term pathophysiologic consequences similar to what we see in patients with OSA. Recent evidences also demonstrate that there are remarkable differences in the response of the physiologic systems to sustained hypoxia and intermittent hypoxia. This review is aimed to briefly discuss the clinical significance of sleep-disordered breathing and our current understanding of CIH.},

  Abstract                 = {Post-traumatic seizures (PTS) can be a serious complication of head injury, because they can cause secondary brain damage through increased metabolic requirements, raised intracranial pressure, cerebral hypoxia, and/or excessive release of neurotransmitters. In children, early PTS are more frequent than late ones. In this retrospective study we conducted an epidemiological analysis and tried to identify potential risk factors for the onset of early PTS in children hospitalized for head injury in our Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. The severity of injury was assessed using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), while the outcome of traumatized children was defined using the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS). Early PTS were diagnosed in 15 out of the 125 children hospitalized (12\%). Most of the children (73.3\%), developed seizures within 24 h of the trauma (immediate PTS). Among the risk factors, a very important role was played by the severity of the injury; in fact, the incidence of early PTS among patients with GCS < or = 8 was ten times greater than that among children with GCS 13-15. Other risk factors that significantly influenced the onset of early PTS, were age (60\% of children with early PTS were less than 3 years old) and severe cerebral edema. Overall, children with early PTS had a worse outcome than the other patients. In fact, 53\% had a GOS of < or = 3 compared to 19.1\% of those without early PTS (P<001). In particular, considering children with severe head injury, 80\% of those with early PTS had a GOS of < or = 3, compared to 41\% of those without early PTS (P<0.05). In conclusion, PTS can be a serious complication of head injury in children, because they can worsen secondary brain damage. Appropriate management of head-trauma patients must include suitable and immediate prophylaxis with anti-epileptic drugs.},

The patients were immediately evaluated for the severity of head injury (Glasgow Coma Score, GCS), clinical presentation, cerebral axial tomography, early complications (hypoxia and hypotension), metabolic and hematological alterations and early post-traumatic seizures. Six months after injury we applied the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS). Correlations with GOS were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic models.In all, 122 children with severe head injury were identified. The patients presented the following scores: 18 (14.7.0\%) children had a GOS of 1; 2 had a GOS of 2 (1.6\%); 27 (22.2\%) a GOS of 3 and 75 (61.5\%) a GOS of 4 or 5. A low GOS was significantly and independently associated with low GCS, multiple trauma, the presence of hypoxia and hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hyperglycemia and early post-traumatic seizures. Hematological alterations (white blood cells) were also associated with a low GOS, though not significantly.In addition to GCS, types of trauma and brain lesion, hypoxia and hypotension, hemocoagulative disorders (DIC), hyperglycemia and early post-traumatic seizures are predictors of GOS. A knowledge of these prognostic factors and the correct management of children with severe head injury helps clinicians to improve outcome and to reduce morbidity and mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {To estimate the surgical efficacy of decompressive craniotomy, 23 children under 2 years of age with acute shaken/impact baby syndrome were treated with medical or surgical methods over the past 6 years. Six children (group A) with lower intracranial pressure (ICP, less than 30 mm Hg) were treated with medical therapy, and 17 children with high ICP (more than 30 mm Hg) of which 7 children were treated with medical therapy (group B) and another 10 children (group C) were treated with decompressive craniotomy. Bifrontal craniotomy was performed on 5 children with generalized brain swelling. A large frontotemporoparietal craniotomy was performed on another 5 children with unilateral swelling. A mean of 32 ml of subdural hematoma was removed. The mean ICP was reduced by 80% in the craniotomy group, p < 0.05. Children in groups A and C performed better on the Children's Outcome Scale than those in group B, p < 0.05. Mortality was significantly lower (0/10) in group C than in group B (3/7), p < 0.05. Hearing preservation was better in group C than in group B, p < 0.05. Bifrontal and frontotemporoparietal craniotomies may reduce mortality and morbidity for acute shaken/impact baby syndrome with high ICP. Patients with ICP less than 30 mm Hg may be treated successfully with medical therapy and patients with ICP more than 30 mm Hg are better treated with decompressive craniotomy.},

  Abstract                 = {"The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure" provides a new guideline for hypertension prevention and management. The following are the key messages(1) In persons older than 50 years, systolic blood pressure (BP) of more than 140 mm Hg is a much more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; (2) The risk of CVD, beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, doubles with each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; individuals who are normotensive at 55 years of age have a 90% lifetime risk for developing hypertension; (3) Individuals with a systolic BP of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mm Hg should be considered as prehypertensive and require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent CVD; (4) Thiazide-type diuretics should be used in drug treatment for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes. Certain high-risk conditions are compelling indications for the initial use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); (5) Most patients with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive medications to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease); (6) If BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal BP, consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 2 agents, 1 of which usually should be a thiazide-type diuretic; and (7) The most effective therapy prescribed by the most careful clinician will control hypertension only if patients are motivated. Motivation improves when patients have positive experiences with and trust in the clinician. Empathy builds trust and is a potent motivator. Finally, in presenting these guidelines, the committee recognizes that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.},

Patients transferred from a neonatal ICU prior to ever being discharged home, already mobilizing well or at baseline functional status at time of screening, with an English language barrier, and prior enrollment into this study, were excluded.None.The primary outcome was feasibility, as defined by the ability to screen, enroll eligible patients, and execute the study procedures and measurements on participants. Secondary outcomes included functional status at baseline, 3 and 6 months, PICU morbidity, and mortality. Functional status was measured using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory and the Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth. Thirty-three patients were enrolled between October 2012 and April 2013. Consent rate was 85\%, and follow-up rates were 93\% at 3 months and 71\% at 6 months. We were able to execute the study procedures and measurements, demonstrating feasibility of conducting a future longitudinal study. Functional status deteriorated following critical illness. Recovery appears to be influenced by baseline health or functional status and severity of illness.Longitudinal research is needed to understand how children recover after a critical illness. Our results suggest factors that may influence the recovery trajectory and were used to inform the methodology, outcomes of interest, and appropriate sample size of a larger multicenter study evaluating functional recovery in this population.},

One yr after HSCT, the mean serum ferritin level was 1158 ng/mL (range, 22-3264 ng/mL), with 124 patients (93.2%) having a serum ferritin level that exceeded the upper limit of the normal range (110 ng/mL). Thereafter, the serum ferritin level declined over time. There was a positive correlation between the level of serum ferritin and that of total bilirubin (r = 0.21, p < 0.001) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (r = 0.17, p < 0.001). A high concentration of serum ferritin was associated with low cardiac fractional shortening (r = -0.15, p = 0.047). In addition, patients with hypothyroidism and GH deficiency had a higher level of serum ferritin than those without (p < 0.02). We conclude that iron overload is common after HSCT and is associated with hepatic, cardiac, and endocrine dysfunction.},

We obtained information on traumatic brain injury and epilepsy from the National Hospital Register and estimated relative risks (RR) with Poisson analyses.Risk of epilepsy was increased after a mild brain injury (RR 2.22, 95\% CI 2.07-2.38), severe brain injury (7.40, 6.16-8.89), and skull fracture (2.17, 1.73-2.71). The risk was increased more than 10 years after mild brain injury (1.51, 1.24-1.85), severe brain injury (4.29, 2.04-9.00), and skull fracture (2.06, 1.37-3.11). RR increased with age at mild and severe injury and was especially high among people older than 15 years of age with mild (3.51, 2.90-4.26) and severe (12.24, 8.52-17.57) injury. The risk was slightly higher in women (2.49, 2.25-2.76) than in men (2.01, 1.83-2.22). Patients with a family history of epilepsy had a notably high risk of epilepsy after mild (5.75, 4.56-7.27) and severe brain injury (10.09, 4.20-24.26).The longlasting high risk of epilepsy after brain injury might provide a window for prevention of post-traumatic epilepsy.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of postmastectomy reconstruction and investigate the impact of socioeconomic status on the receipt of reconstruction. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Outcomes Project is a prospective, multi-institutional database that contains data on all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients treated at one of the participating comprehensive cancer centers. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 2174 patients with DCIS and stage I, II, and III invasive breast cancer who underwent mastectomy at one of 8 NCCN centers. Rates of reconstruction were determined. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate whether socioeconomic characteristics are associated with breast reconstruction. RESULTS: Overall, 42% of patients had breast reconstruction following mastectomy. Patients with Medicaid and Medicare were less likely to undergo reconstruction than those with managed care insurance; however, there was no difference for indemnity versus managed care insurance. Homemakers and retired patients had fewer reconstructions than those employed outside the home. Patients with a high school education or less were less likely to have reconstruction than those with more education. Race and ethnicity were not significant predictors of reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: The reconstruction rate in this study (42%) is markedly higher than those previously reported. The type of insurance, education level, and employment status of a patient, but not her race or ethnicity, appear to influence the use of breast reconstruction. Because all patients were treated at an NCCN institution, these socioeconomic differences cannot be explained by access to care.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) causes progressive deterioration in lung function. The purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of a tobramycin highly concentrated solution for inhalation (TSI) [300mg/4mL; Bramitob when added to other antipseudomonal therapies in CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection. METHODS: In a multinational, double-blind, multicenter study, CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection were randomized to receive nebulized tobramycin or placebo over a 24-week study period in which 4-week treatment periods ('on' cycles) were followed by 4-week periods without treatment ('off' cycles). Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) percentage of predicted normal was used as the primary efficacy outcome parameter. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC (FEF(25)(-)(75%)), P. aeruginosa susceptibility, minimum concentration required to inhibit 90% of strains (MIC(90)), rates of P. aeruginosa-negative culture, P. aeruginosa persistence and superinfection, need for hospitalization and parenteral antipseudomonal antibiotics, loss of school/working days due to the disease, and nutritional status (bodyweight and body mass index) were considered as secondary efficacy outcome parameters. Adverse events reporting, audiometry, and renal function were monitored to evaluate the tolerability and safety of TSI. RESULTS: A total of 247 patients were randomized in the study. At endpoint time assessment (week 20), FEV(1) was significantly increased in the tobramycin group and the adjusted mean difference between groups (intention-to-treat population) was statistically significant (p < 0.001). At the same time, clinically relevant improvements in FVC and FEF(25-75%) were detected in the TSI group (p = 0.022 and p = 0.001, respectively). The microbiologic outcomes at the end of the last 'on' cycle period were significantly better in the TSI group than the placebo group (p = 0.024), although there was a concomitant trend toward an increase in the MIC of isolated P. aeruginosa strains. The percentage of patients hospitalized as well as the need for parenteral antipseudomonal antibiotics was significantly lower in the TSI group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.009, respectively). Patients treated with TSI had fewer lost school/working days due to the disease (p < 0.001). A favorable effect of tobramycin in terms of an increase in bodyweight and body mass index was also noted, when compared with placebo, at all time points (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). No significant changes in serum creatinine and auditory function were detected. The proportion of patients with drug-related adverse events was 15% in both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term, intermittent administration of this aerosolized tobramycin formulation (300mg/4mL) in CF patients with P. aeruginosa chronic infection significantly improved pulmonary function and microbiologic outcome, decreased hospitalizations, increased nutritional status, and was well tolerated.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the predictive value of the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and the Glasgow motor component (GMC) for overall mortality, death on arrival, and major injury and the relationship between GCS and length of stay (LOS) in the emergency department (ED) and hospital. METHODS: Records from the American College of Surgeons National Trauma Data Base from 2007 to 2009 were extracted. Patients 0 to 18 years old transported from a trauma scene with complete initial scene data were included. Statistical analysis, including construction of receiver-operator curves, determined the correlation between GCS, GMC, and the clinical outcomes of interest. RESULTS: There were 104,035 records with complete data for analysis, including 3946 deaths. Mean patient age was 12.6 (SD, 5.5) years. Glasgow coma scale was predictive of overall mortality, with area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) of 0.946 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.941-0.951); death on arrival, with AUC of 0.958 (95% CI, 0.953-0.963); and risk of major injury, with AUC of 0.720 (0.715-0.724). Lower GCS scores were associated with shorter ED LOS and longer hospital stays (P <0.001, analysis of variance) except GCS 3, associated with shorter hospitalizations. For predicting overall mortality, the AUC for GMC was 0.940 (95% CI, 0.935-0.945), and for predicting major injury, the AUC was 0.681 (95% CI, 0.677-0.686). CONCLUSIONS: For pediatric trauma victims, the GCS is predictive of mortality and injury outcomes, as well as both ED and hospital LOS, and has excellent prognostic accuracy. The GMC has predictive value for injury and mortality that is nearly equivalent to the full GCS.},

In each setting, the continuum of care includes emergency medical services, intensive and acute medical care, inpatient rehabilitation, and a spectrum of community rehabilitation services.Six hundred sixty-five rehabilitation patients admitted to acute care within 24 hours of traumatic brain injury between 1989 and 1996.Annual incidence and etiology of rehospitalization.The annual incidence of rehospitalization ranged from 20\% to 22.5\%. Approximately half the rehospitalizations were for elective reasons. The most common reason for rehospitalization was for orthopedic or reconstructive surgery, followed by infectious disorders and general health maintenance. After the first year, the incidence of readmissions for seizures and psychiatric difficulties increased substantially. ANOVA and chi2 analyses were performed on data from the first year postinjury. No statistically significant associations were noted between incidence and etiology of rehospitalization and: demographics; injury severity; payer source for rehabilitation; concurrent injuries; acute care and rehabilitation length of stays; discharge Functional Assessment Measure; and discharge residence (p > .05).There is a relatively stable but high rate of rehospitalization for at least 3 years after injury. The costs of rehospitalization should be considered when evaluating the long-term consequences of injury.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: In 1976, the Committee on Perinatal Health recommended that hospitals with no neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or intermediate NICUs transfer high-risk mothers and infants that weigh <2000 g to a regional NICU. This standard was based on expert opinion and has not been validated carefully. This study evaluated the effect of NICU level and patient volume at the hospital of birth on neonatal mortality of infants with a birth weight (BW) of <2000 g. METHODS: Birth certificates of 16 732 singleton infants who had a BW of <2000 g and were born in nonfederal hospitals in California in 1992 and 1993 were linked to death certificates and to discharge abstracts. The hospitals were classified by the level of NICU: no NICU, no intensive care; intermediate NICU, intermediate intensive care; community NICU, expanded intermediate intensive care; and regional NICU, tertiary intensive care. A logistic regression model that controlled for demographic risks, diagnoses, transfer, average NICU census, and NICU level was estimated using death within the first 28 days or first year of life if continuously hospitalized as the main outcome measure. RESULTS: Compared with birth in a hospital with a regional NICU, risk-adjusted mortality of infants with BW of <2000 g was higher when birth occurred in hospitals with no NICU (odds ratio [OR]: 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.81-3.13), an intermediate NICU (OR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.44-2.54), or a small (average census <15) community NICU (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.14-1.76). Risk-adjusted mortality for infants who were born in hospitals with a large (average census > or =15) community NICU was not statistically different compared with those with a regional NICU (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.87-1.43). Except for large community NICUs, all of these ORs are larger when the data are restricted to infants with BW of <1500 g or BW of <1250 g and smaller for BW between 1250 g and 1999 g and 1500 g and 1999 g. For large community NICUs, the results are similar for the smaller BW intervals and significant only for the larger BW interval. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the recommendation that hospitals with no NICU or intermediate NICUs transfer high-risk mothers with estimated fetal weight of <2000 g to a regional NICU. For infants with BW of <2000 g, birth at a hospital with a regional NICU is associated with a lower risk-adjusted mortality than birth at a hospital with no NICU, intermediate NICU of any size, or small community NICU. Subsequent neonatal transfer to a regional NICU only marginally decreases the disadvantage of birth at these hospitals. The evidence for the few hospitals with large community NICUs is mixed. Although the data point to higher mortality in large community NICUs, they are not conclusive and additional study is needed on the mortality effects of large community NICUs. Greater efforts should be made to deliver infants with expected BW of <2000 g at hospitals with regional NICUs.},

We assessed the ventilator-associated events algorithm in pediatric patients.A retrospective observational cohort study.This single-center study took place in a PICU at an urban academic medical facility.Pediatric (ages 0-18 yr old) trauma patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury ventilated for greater than or equal to 2 days.We assessed for pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia (as defined by current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PNU2 guidelines), adult ventilator-associated events, and an experimental ventilator-associated events definition modified for pediatric patients. We compared ventilator-associated events to ventilator-associated pneumonia to calculate the test characteristics. Thirty-nine of 119 patients (33\%) developed ventilator-associated pneumonia. Sensitivity of the adult ventilator-associated condition definition was 23\% (95\% CI, 11-39\%), which increased to 56\% (95\% CI, 40-72\%) using the modified pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia criterion. Specificity reached 100\% for both original and modified pediatric probable ventilator-associated pneumonia using ventilator-associated events criteria. Children who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia or ventilator-associated condition had similar baseline characteristics: age, mechanism of injury, injury severity scores, and use of an intracranial pressure monitor. Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated condition portended similarly unfavorable outcomes: longer median duration of ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and more discharges to rehabilitation, home health, or nursing care compared with patients with no pulmonary complication.Both current and modified ventilator-associated events criteria have poor sensitivity but good specificity in identifying pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia. Despite poor sensitivity, the high specificity of the ventilator-associated events diagnoses does provide a useful and objective metric for interinstitution ICU comparison. Ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated condition were both associated with excess morbidity in pediatric traumatic brain injury patients.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a frequent complication during recovery of severely traumatized patients. The primary objective of this study was to determine if prophylactic administration of aerosolized ceftazidime reduced the incidence of VAP in high-risk injured patients without altering the incidence of other infectious complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-institution double-blind, randomized trial that compared a seven-day course of aerosolized ceftazidime with placebo. Intubated high-risk patients admitted to the trauma intensive care unit at a large regional trauma center between February 2003 and September 2005 were eligible for enrollment. The main outcome evaluated was the incidence of VAP at two weeks and 30 days. The incidences of multi-drug-resistant infections and other infectious complications were secondary outcomes. Results: A total of 105 patients were randomized, resulting in 52 patients in the placebo arm and 53 patients in the ceftazidime arm. There was no statistical difference between the groups with regard to demographic data, injury severity, calculated risk of VAP, or the number of doses received. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the incidence of VAP at two weeks was 24/52 (46%) in the placebo group and 21/53 (40%) in the ceftazidime group. The number of patients with VAP at 30 days was 26/52 (50%) in the placebo group and 26/53 (49%) in the ceftazidime group. There was no statistical difference in the development of multi-drug-resistant VAP or other infectious complications in the two groups. CONCLUSION: The use of aerosolized ceftazidime did not reduce the rate of VAP in high-risk patients admitted after traumatic injury, but neither did it increase the incidence of other infectious complications. Routine use of prophylactic aerosolized ceftazidime to prevent VAP in trauma patients cannot be recommended.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: We sought to obtain more reliable population-based data for injury epidemiology and trauma system evaluation by linking several sources. METHODS: In the state of Maine, probabilistic computer methods were used to link data from hospitals contained in a trauma registry for 1995 to 1996 to data from the same years contained in death certificates, ambulance run reports, and hospital discharge abstracts. The most reliable data available from each source were merged to form a standard record for each identifiable case of acute trauma. RESULTS: A total of 8,924 cases of serious injury were identified that either were in the registry, had a death certificate, or had both an ambulance run report and a hospital discharge abstract. Only 74% of the Trauma Center cases and 33% of the cases overall were contained in the registry. Only 84% of fatal hospitalized cases matched to a death certificate. Incompleteness of the registry and occasional failures to match records from one source to another were attributable to intentional omissions and a variety of human data management problems. CONCLUSIONS: Combining sources of data for injury victims can produce a resource more descriptive than any single source alone. However, computer-assisted record linkage still requires human review and corrections. Feedback of discrepancies to the individual data sources should further improve the quality of data available for linkage.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Risk adjustment methods are needed for population-based studies of injured patients. METHODS: Data were obtained from National Hospital Discharge Surveys, 1996 to 2000. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnoses were used to categorize Abbreviated Injury Scale score, Injury Severity Score, ICD-9-CM Injury Severity Score, injury mechanisms, and comorbidities. Regression models for weighted survey data were constructed from combinations of these classifications, plus age and sex, to predict mortality, length of stay (LOS), or discharge to long-term care (LTC). RESULTS: Increased Abbreviated Injury Scale score, increased Injury Severity Score, or decreased ICD-9-CM Injury Severity Score were similarly associated with mortality, prolonged LOS, or more frequent LTC, as was increased age. Penetrating or burn mechanisms were associated with mortality and longer LOS; penetrating or vehicle mechanisms were associated with less frequent LTC. Different comorbidities affected LOS and LTC. Men had shorter LOS and less frequent LTC than women. CONCLUSION: Hospital outcomes after injury are predictable from age, sex, and standard diagnosis groupings. Anatomic scales gave similar results when adjusted for other factors.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Injury mortality in rural regions remains high with little evidence that trauma system implementation has benefited rural populations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risk-adjusted mortality in remote regions of Oregon before and after implementation of a statewide trauma system. RESEARCH DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study assessing injury mortality through 30 days after hospital discharge. SETTING: Nine rural Oregon hospitals serving counties with populations <18 persons per square mile. SUBJECTS: Severely injured patients presenting to four level-3 and five level-4 trauma hospitals 3 years before and 3 years after trauma system implementation. MEASURES: Interhospital transfer, hospital death, and demise within 30 days following hospital discharge. RESULTS: A total of 940 patients were analyzed. After trauma system implementation, patients presenting to level-4 hospitals were more likely transferred to level-2 facilities (P <0.001). Interhospital transfer times from level-3 hospitals lengthened significantly after system implementation (P <0.001). Overall mortality rates were higher in the postsystem period (8.3%) than the presystem period (6.7%), but not significantly. Controlling for covariates, no additional benefit to risk-adjusted mortality was associated with trauma system implementation. Additional deaths, occurring after trauma system implementation, included head-injured patients transferred from rural hospitals to nonlevel-1 trauma center hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Increased injury survival after Oregon trauma system implementation, demonstrated in urban and statewide analyses, was not confirmed in remote regions of the state. Efforts to improve trauma systems in rural areas should focus on the processes of care for head-injured patients transferred to higher designation trauma centers.},

  Abstract                 = {Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is commonly delivered by a patch for the treatment of angina pectoris. The idea is now generally accepted that GTN requires a biotransformation process that activates the drug, in particular through nitric oxide (NO) generation. However, the pharmacokinetics of NO delivery from GTN still remains obscure. The objective of this study was to assess GTN-derived NO formation in vascular tissues and organs in rabbit given GTN patches. NO levels were evaluated in rabbits after 3 h of treatment with a 10 mg GTN patch (GTN group; n = 7) or a placebo patch (CTL; n = 7). Nitrosylhaemoglobin (HbNO) was evaluated by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy in red cell suspension. In vivo spin trapping technique using FeMGD as a spin trap, associated with ESR was used to quantify NO in tissues. The NO-spin trap complex, which is a relatively stable product, has been measured in several tissues. The ESR spectrum corresponding to HbNO was not found in red cell of GTN or CTL rabbits. The spectrum corresponding to the NO-spin trap complex was observed in all analysed tissues of CTL rabbits. The signal was significantly increased in liver, renal medulla, heart left ventricle and spleen of GTN-treated rabbits, and to a lesser extent in right ventricle and lung. No difference was shown between NO-spin trap levels measured in aorta or inferior vena cava from GTN or CTL rabbits. These data suggest that GTN patch treatment induced NO release, and that tissue-specific differences in transdermal GTN-derived NO exist. The GTN-NO pathway appears to be largely involved in organs such as the liver, kidney and heart.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECT: In a recently conducted trial of hypothermia in patients with severe brain injury, differences were found in the effects of hypothermia treatment among various centers. This analysis explores the reasons for such differences. METHODS: The authors reviewed data obtained in 392 patients treated for severe brain injury. Prerandomization variables, critical physiological variables, treatment variables, and accrual methodologies were investigated among various centers. Hypothermia was found to be detrimental in patients older than the age of 45 years, beneficial in patients younger than 45 years of age in whom hypothermia was present on admission, and without effect in those in whom normothermia was documented on admission. Marginally significant differences (p < 0.054) in the intercenter outcomes of hypothermia-treated patients were likely the result of wide differences in the percentage of patients older than 45 years of age and in the percentage of patients in whom hypothermia was present on admission among centers. The trial sensitivity was likely diminished by significant differences in the incidence of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) less than 70 mm Hg (p < 0.001) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) less than 50 mm Hg (p < 0.05) but not intracranial pressure (ICP) greater than 25 mm Hg (not significant) among patients in the various centers. Hours of vasopressor usage (p < 0.03) and morphine dose (p < 0.001) and the percentage of dehydrated patients varied significantly among centers (p < 0.001). The participation of small centers increased intercenter variance and diminished the quality of data. CONCLUSIONS: For Phase III clinical trials we recommend: 1) a detailed protocol specifying fluid and MABP, ICP, and CPP management: 2) continuous monitoring of protocol compliance; 3) a run-in period for new centers to test accrual and protocol adherence; and 4) inclusion of only centers in which patients are regularly randomized.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Induction of hypothermia in patients with brain injury was shown to improve outcomes in small clinical studies, but the results were not definitive. To study this issue, we conducted a multicenter trial comparing the effects of hypothermia with those of normothermia in patients with acute brain injury. METHODS: The study subjects were 392 patients 16 to 65 years of age with coma after sustaining closed head injuries who were randomly assigned to be treated with hypothermia (body temperature, 33 degrees C), which was initiated within 6 hours after injury and maintained for 48 hours by means of surface cooling, or normothermia. All patients otherwise received standard treatment. The primary outcome measure was functional status six months after the injury. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients and the type and severity of injury in the two treatment groups were similar. The mean (+/-SD) time from injury to randomization was 4.3+/-1.1 hours in the hypothermia group and 4.1+/-1.2 hours in the normothermia group, and the mean time from injury to the achievement of the target temperature of 33 degrees C in the hypothermia group was 8.4+/-3.0 hours. The outcome was poor (defined as severe disability, a vegetative state, or death) in 57 percent of the patients in both groups. Mortality was 28 percent in the hypothermia group and 27 percent in the normothermia group (P=0.79). The patients in the hypothermia group had more hospital days with complications than the patients in the normothermia group. Fewer patients in the hypothermia group had high intracranial pressure than in the normothermia group. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with hypothermia, with the body temperature reaching 33 degrees C within eight hours after injury, is not effective in improving outcomes in patients with severe brain injury.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of definition and location (field, emergency department, or pediatric intensive care unit) of hypotension on outcome following severe pediatric traumatic brain injury. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Harborview Medical Center (level I pediatric trauma center), Seattle, WA, over a 5-yr period between 1998 and 2003. PATIENTS: Ninety-three children <14 yrs of age with traumatic brain injury following injury, head Abbreviated Injury Score > or = 3, and pediatric intensive care unit admission Glasgow Coma Scale score <9 formed the analytic sample. Data sources included the Harborview Trauma Registry and hospital records. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The relationship between hypotension and outcome was examined comparing two definitions of hypotension: a) systolic blood pressure <5th percentile for age; and b) systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg. Hospital discharge Glasgow Outcome Score <4 or disposition of either death or discharge to a skilled nursing facility was considered a poor outcome. Pediatric intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were also examined. Systolic blood pressure <5th percentile for age was more highly associated with poor hospital discharge Glasgow Outcome Score (p = .001), poor disposition (p = .02), pediatric intensive care unit length of stay (rate ratio 9.5; 95% confidence interval 6.7-12.3), and hospital length of stay (rate ratio 18.8; 95% confidence interval 14.0-23.5) than systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg. Hypotension occurring in either the field or emergency department, but not in the pediatric intensive care unit, was associated with poor Glasgow Outcome Score (p = .008), poor disposition (p = .03), and hospital length of stay (rate ratio 18.7; 95% confidence interval 13.1-24.2). CONCLUSIONS: Early hypotension, defined as systolic blood pressure <5th percentile for age in the field and/or emergency department, was a better predictor of poor outcome than delayed hypotension or the use of systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Antiviral therapy reduces symptom duration and hospitalization risk among previously healthy and chronically ill children infected with seasonal influenza. The effect of oseltamivir on outcomes of hospitalized children is unknown. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether oseltamivir improves outcomes of critically ill children hospitalized with influenza. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of children with influenza infection admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit during 6 consecutive winter seasons (2001-2007). We used the Pediatric Health Information System database, which contains resource utilization data from 41 children's hospitals. We matched oseltamivir-treated patients with oseltamivir-nontreated patients by the probability of oseltamivir exposure using a propensity score we derived from patient and hospital characteristics. We subsequently compared the outcomes of critically ill children treated with oseltamivir within 24 hours of admission with propensity score matched children who were not treated with oseltamivir. RESULTS: We identified 1257 children with influenza infection, 264 of whom were treated with oseltamivir within 24 hours of hospital admission. Multivariable analysis of 252 oseltamivir-treated patients and 252 propensity score-matched untreated patients demonstrated that patients treated with oseltamivir experienced an 18% reduction in total hospital days (time ratio: 0.82, P = 0.02), whereas intensive care unit stay, in-hospital mortality, and readmission rates did not differ. CONCLUSION: For critically ill children infected with seasonal influenza, treatment with oseltamivir within 24 hours of hospitalization was associated with a shorter duration of hospital stay. Additional study is needed to determine the effect of delayed initiation of oseltamivir on clinical outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Early recognition of predictors of unfavorable evolution of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) might prompt therapeutic measures that might improve outcome. The objective of this study was to describe resolution of VAP variables and to determine early predictors of VAP recurrence and death. DESIGN AND SETTING: Description of the natural course of VAP resolution and multivariable analyses of predictors of VAP recurrence and death by day 28 after VAP onset based on the 401 patients included in the PNEUMA trial, a multiple-center, randomized study comparing 8 vs. 15 days of antibiotics for microbiologically proven VAP. Every patient included in that trial had received appropriate empirical antibiotics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: By day 28 after VAP onset, 27% of patients had VAP recurrence and 18% had died. On day 8 after VAP onset, predictors of VAP recurrence included intensive care unit admission Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (odds ratio [OR], 1.02), radiologic score (OR, 1.17), temperature (OR, 1.34), nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli (OR, 2.00) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (OR, 2.50) as pathogens responsible for VAP, and mechanical ventilation dependency (OR, 2.08). Day 8 predictors of 28-day death were age (OR, 1.06), female sex (OR, 2.30), Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment score (OR, 1.26), and nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli (OR, 2.83) as pathogens responsible for VAP. However, the duration of antimicrobial therapy (8 vs. 15 days) was not associated with any of the studied adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: For patients benefiting from appropriate empirical antibiotics for VAP, early predictors of infection recurrence or death included demographic characteristics, such as age or female sex, disease severity at VAP onset, nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli or methicillin-resistant S. aureus as VAP-causative pathogens, prolonged mechanical ventilation dependency, persistent fever, and severity of lung injury. Future studies should attempt to determine whether specific diagnostic or therapeutic strategies could markedly improve VAP outcomes when early criteria for treatment failure are present.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Injury to the cervical spine (CS) is common after major trauma. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma first published its Practice Management Guidelines for the evaluation of CS injury in 1998. A subsequent revision was published in 2000. Since that time a large volume of literature has been published. As a result, the Practice Management Guidelines Committee set out to develop updated guidelines for the identification of CS injury. METHODS: A search of the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health MEDLINE database was performed using PubMed (www.pubmed.gov). The search retrieved English language articles regarding the identification of CS injury from 1998 to 2007. The questions posed were: who needs CS imaging; what imaging should be obtained; when should computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or flexion/extension radiographs be used; and how is significant ligamentous injury excluded in the comatose patient? RESULTS: Seventy-eight articles were identified. From this group, 52 articles were selected to construct the guidelines. CONCLUSION: There have been significant changes in practice since the previous CS injury guidelines. Most significantly, computed tomography has supplanted plain radiography as the primary screening modality in those who require imaging. Clinical clearance remains the standard in awake, alert patients with trauma without neurologic deficit or distracting injury who have no neck pain or tenderness with full range of motion. Cervical collars should be removed as soon as feasible. Controversy persists regarding CS clearance in the obtunded patient without gross neurologic deficit.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the use of right heart catheterization (RHC) during the first 24 hours of care in the intensive care unit (ICU) and subsequent survival, length of stay, intensity of care, and cost of care. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Five US teaching hospitals between 1989 and 1994. SUBJECTS: A total of 5735 critically ill adult patients receiving care in an ICU for 1 of 9 prespecified disease categories. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival time, cost of care, intensity of care, and length of stay in the ICU and hospital, determined from the clinical record and from the National Death Index. A propensity score for RHC was constructed using multivariable logistic regression. Case-matching and multivariable regression modeling techniques were used to estimate the association of RHC with specific outcomes after adjusting for treatment selection using the propensity score. Sensitivity analysis was used to estimate the potential effect of an unidentified or missing covariate on the results. RESULTS: By case-matching analysis, patients with RHC had an increased 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.49). The mean cost (25th, 50th, 75th percentiles) per hospital stay was $49 300 ($17 000, $30 500, $56 600) with RHC and $35 700 ($11 300, $20 600, $39 200) without RHC. Mean length of stay in the ICU was 14.8 (5, 9, 17) days with RHC and 13.0 (4, 7, 14) days without RHC. These findings were all confirmed by multivariable modeling techniques. Subgroup analysis did not reveal any patient group or site for which RHC was associated with improved outcomes. Patients with higher baseline probability of surviving 2 months had the highest relative risk of death following RHC. Sensitivity analysis suggested that a missing covariate would have to increase the risk of death 6-fold and the risk of RHC 6-fold for a true beneficial effect of RHC to be misrepresented as harmful. CONCLUSION: In this observational study of critically ill patients, after adjustment for treatment selection bias, RHC was associated with increased mortality and increased utilization of resources. The cause of this apparent lack of benefit is unclear. The results of this analysis should be confirmed in other observational studies. These findings justify reconsideration of a randomized controlled trial of RHC and may guide patient selection for such a study.},

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of children 1 month to 12 years of age hospitalized for UTI at 25 children's hospitals from 1999 to 2004. We measured variability in length-of-stay (LOS), cost, readmission rate, intensive care unit admission, and performance of renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram and identified patient and hospital factors associated with these outcomes. RESULTS: The cohort included 20,892 children. There was significant variation in outcomes and processes of care across hospitals (eg, mean LOS, 2.1-5.0 days; patients with both imaging tests performed, 0.3%-72.9%). Older children had shorter LOS and were less likely to undergo imaging. Patients hospitalized at high volume hospitals were more likely to undergo imaging. Hospitals with high percentage of Medicaid patients had longer LOS and were less likely to perform imaging tests. Hospitals with a clinical practice guideline for UTI had shorter LOS and decreased costs per admission. CONCLUSIONS: The variability across hospitals may represent opportunities for benchmarking, standardization, and quality improvement. Decreased LOS and costs associated with clinical practice guidelines support their implementation.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the characteristics and medical outcomes of motor vehicle crashes for drivers 70 years and older with those of drivers between the ages of 30 and 39 years. METHODS: We probabilistically linked statewide motor vehicle crash and hospital discharge data between the years of 1992 and 1995 for the state of Utah. We calculated the odds of older drivers exhibiting certain motor vehicle crash characteristics compared with younger drivers. Adjusting for nighttime crash, high-speed crash, and seatbelt use, we calculated the odds of an older driver being killed or hospitalized compared with those of a younger driver. RESULTS: During the study years, there were 14,466 drivers older than 69 years and 68,706 drivers between the ages of 30 and 39 years involved in motor vehicle crashes in Utah. Older drivers were less likely to have crashes involving drug or alcohol use (odds ratio [OR] 0.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1 to 0.2) and less likely to have crashes at high speed (OR 0.6; 95% CI 0.6 to 0.7). Although older drivers were no more likely to have a crash involving a right-hand turn (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.9 to 1.1) than younger drivers, they were over twice as likely to have a crash involving a left-hand turn (OR 2.3; 95% CI 2.2 to 2.5). Also, older drivers were more likely to be killed or hospitalized than younger drivers (OR, 3.5; P <.001). Among belted drivers, an older driver was nearly 7 times more likely to be killed or hospitalized than a younger driver (OR 6. 9; 95% CI 5.4 to 8.9). CONCLUSION: Older drivers do have distinctive motor vehicle crash patterns. Interventions must be taken to reduce the number of left-hand turn crashes involving older drivers. In addition, further research is needed to design, implement, and evaluate countermeasures that may enable older drivers to continue driving while keeping public safety in the forefront.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: With important technological advances in healthcare delivery and the Internet, clinicians and scientists now have access to overwhelming number of available databases capturing patients with critical illness. Yet, investigators seeking to answer important clinical or research questions with existing data have few resources that adequately describe the available sources and the strengths and limitations of each. This article reviews an approach to selecting a database to address health services and outcomes research questions in critical care, examines several databases that are commonly used for this purpose, and briefly describes some strengths and limitations of each. DATA SOURCES: Narrative review of the medical literature. SUMMARY: The available databases that collect information on critically ill patients are numerous and vary in the types of questions they can optimally answer. Selection of a data source must consider not only accessibility but also the quality of the data contained within the database, and the extent to which it captures the necessary variables for the research question. Questions seeking causal associations (e.g., effect of treatment on mortality) usually either require secondary data that contain detailed information about demographics, laboratories, and physiology to best address nonrandom selection or sophisticated study design. Purely descriptive questions (e.g., incidence of respiratory failure) can often be addressed using secondary data with less detail such as administrative claims. Although each database has its own inherent limitations, all secondary analyses will be subject to the same challenges of appropriate study design and good observational research. CONCLUSION: The literature demonstrates that secondary analyses can have significant impact on critical care practice. While selection of the optimal database for a particular question is a necessary part of high-quality analyses, it is not sufficient to guarantee an unbiased study. Thoughtful and well-constructed study design and analysis approaches remain equally important pillars of robust science. Only through responsible use of existing data will investigators ensure that their study has the greatest impact on critical care practice and outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between volume of nonoperative mechanically ventilated patients receiving care in a specific Veterans Health Administration hospital and their mortality. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: One-hundred nineteen Veterans Health Administration medical centers. PATIENTS: We identified 5,131 hospitalizations involving mechanically ventilated patients in an intensive care unit during 2009, who did not receive surgery. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We extracted demographic and clinical data from the VA Inpatient Evaluation Center. For each hospital, we defined volume as the total number of nonsurgical admissions receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit during 2009. We examined the hospital contribution to 30-day mortality using multilevel logistic regression models with a random intercept for each hospital. We quantified the extent of interhospital variation in 30-day mortality using the intraclass correlation coefficient and median odds ratio. We used generalized estimating equations to examine the relationship between volume and 30-day mortality and risk-adjusted all models using a patient-level prognostic score derived from clinical data representing the risk of death conditional on treatment at a high-volume hospital. Mean age for the sample was 65 (SD 11) yrs, 97% were men, and 60% were white. The median VA hospital cared for 40 (interquartile range 19-62) mechanically ventilated patients in 2009. Crude 30-day mortality for these patients was 36.9%. After reliability and risk adjustment to the median patient, adjusted hospital-level mortality varied from 33.5% to 40.6%. The intraclass correlation coefficient for the hospital-level variation was 0.6% (95% confidence interval 0.1, 3.4%), with a median odds ratio of 1.15 (95% confidence interval 1.06, 1.38). The relationship between hospital volume of mechanically ventilated and 30-day mortality was not statistically significant: each 50-patient increase in volume was associated with a nonsignificant 2% decrease in the odds of death within 30 days (odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.10). CONCLUSIONS: Veterans Health Administration hospitals caring for lower volumes of mechanically ventilated patients do not have worse mortality. Mechanisms underlying this finding are unclear, but, if elucidated, may offer other integrated health systems ways to overcome the disadvantages of small-volume centers in achieving good outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who are admitted to hospitals without coronary revascularization are frequently transferred to hospitals with this capability. We sought to determine whether the timeliness of hospital transfer and quality of destination hospitals differed between black and white patients. METHODS: We evaluated all white and black Medicare beneficiaries admitted with AMI at nonrevascularization hospitals in 2006 who were transferred to a revascularization hospital. We compared hospital length of stay before transfer and the transfer destination's 30-day risk-standardized mortality rate for AMI between black and white patients. We used hierarchical regression to adjust for patient characteristics and examine within and across-hospital effects of race on 30-day mortality and length of stay before transfer. RESULTS: A total of 25,947 (42%) white and 2345 (37%) black patients with AMI were transferred from 857 urban and 774 rural nonrevascularization hospitals to 928 revascularization hospitals. Median (interquartile range) length of stay before transfer was 1 day (1 to 3 d) for white patients and 2 days (1 to 4 d) for black patients (P<0.001). In adjusted models, black patients tended to be transferred more slowly than white patients, a finding because of both across and within-hospital effects. For example, within a given urban hospital, black patients were transferred an additional 0.24 days (95% confidence interval 0.03-0.44 d) later than white patients. In addition, the lengths of stay before transfer for all patients at urban hospitals increased by 0.37 days (95% confidence interval 0.28-0.47 d) for every 20% increase in the proportion of AMI patients who were black. These results were attenuated in rural hospitals. The risk-standardized mortality rate of the revascularization hospital to which patients were ultimately sent did not differ between black and white patients. CONCLUSIONS: Black patients are transferred more slowly to revascularization hospitals after AMI than white patients, resulting from both less timely transfers within hospitals and admission to hospitals with greater delays in transfer; however, 30-day mortality of the revascularization hospital to which both groups were sent to appeared similar. Race-based delays in transfer may contribute to known racial disparities in outcomes of AMI.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether decompressive craniectomy improves the functional outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury and refractory raised intracranial pressure. METHODS: From December 2002 through April 2010, we randomly assigned 155 adults with severe diffuse traumatic brain injury and intracranial hypertension that was refractory to first-tier therapies to undergo either bifrontotemporoparietal decompressive craniectomy or standard care. The original primary outcome was an unfavorable outcome (a composite of death, vegetative state, or severe disability), as evaluated on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale 6 months after the injury. The final primary outcome was the score on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months. RESULTS: Patients in the craniectomy group, as compared with those in the standard-care group, had less time with intracranial pressures above the treatment threshold (P<0.001), fewer interventions for increased intracranial pressure (P<0.02 for all comparisons), and fewer days in the intensive care unit (ICU) (P<0.001). However, patients undergoing craniectomy had worse scores on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale than those receiving standard care (odds ratio for a worse score in the craniectomy group, 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 3.24; P=0.03) and a greater risk of an unfavorable outcome (odds ratio, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.14 to 4.26; P=0.02). Rates of death at 6 months were similar in the craniectomy group (19%) and the standard-care group (18%). CONCLUSIONS: In adults with severe diffuse traumatic brain injury and refractory intracranial hypertension, early bifrontotemporoparietal decompressive craniectomy decreased intracranial pressure and the length of stay in the ICU but was associated with more unfavorable outcomes.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify the incidence of anemia and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion practice in critically ill patients and to examine the relationship of anemia and RBC transfusion to clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective, multiple center, observational cohort study of intensive care unit (ICU) patients in the United States. Enrollment period was from August 2000 to April 2001. Patients were enrolled within 48 hrs of ICU admission. Patient follow-up was for 30 days, hospital discharge, or death, whichever occurred first. SETTING: A total of 284 ICUs (medical, surgical, or medical-surgical) in 213 hospitals participated in the study. PATIENTS: A total of 4,892 patients were enrolled in the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin level at baseline was 11.0 +/- 2.4 g/dL. Hemoglobin level decreased throughout the duration of the study. Overall, 44% of patients received one or more RBC units while in the ICU (mean, 4.6 +/- 4.9 units). The mean pretransfusion hemoglobin was 8.6 +/- 1.7 g/dL. The mean time to first ICU transfusion was 2.3 +/- 3.7 days. More RBC transfusions were given in study week 1; however, in subsequent weeks, subjects received one to two RBC units per week while in the ICU. The number of RBC transfusions a patient received during the study was independently associated with longer ICU and hospital lengths of stay and an increase in mortality. Patients who received transfusions also had more total complications and were more likely to experience a complication. Baseline hemoglobin was related to the number of RBC transfusions, but it was not an independent predictor of length of stay or mortality. However, a nadir hemoglobin level of <9 g/dL was a predictor of increased mortality and length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is common in the critically ill and results in a large number of RBC transfusions. Transfusion practice has changed little during the past decade. The number of RBC units transfused is an independent predictor of worse clinical outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: The goal of comparative effectiveness analysis is to examine the relationship between two variables, treatment, or exposure and effectiveness or outcome. Unlike data obtained through randomized controlled trials, researchers face greater challenges with causal inference with observational studies. Recognizing these challenges, a task force was formed to develop a guidance document on methodological approaches to addresses these biases. METHODS: The task force was commissioned and a Chair was selected by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Board of Directors in October 2007. This report, the second of three reported in this issue of the Journal, discusses the inherent biases when using secondary data sources for comparative effectiveness analysis and provides methodological recommendations to help mitigate these biases. RESULTS: The task force report provides recommendations and tools for researchers to mitigate threats to validity from bias and confounding in measurement of exposure and outcome. Recommendations on design of study included: the need for data analysis plan with causal diagrams; detailed attention to classification bias in definition of exposure and clinical outcome; careful and appropriate use of restriction; extreme care to identify and control for confounding factors, including time-dependent confounding. CONCLUSIONS: Design of nonrandomized studies of comparative effectiveness face several daunting issues, including measurement of exposure and outcome challenged by misclassification and confounding. Use of causal diagrams and restriction are two techniques that can improve the theoretical basis for analyzing treatment effects in study populations of more homogeneity, with reduced loss of generalizability.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: A variety of methods have been proposed and used in disaster triage situations, but there is little more than expert opinion to support most of them. Anecdotal disaster experiences often report mediocre real-world triage accuracy. The study objective was to determine the accuracy of several disaster triage methods when predicting clinically important outcomes in a large cohort of trauma victims. METHODS: Pediatric, adult, and geriatric trauma victims from the National Trauma Data Bank were assigned triage levels, using each of 6 disaster triage methods: simple triage and rapid treatment (START), Fire Department of New York (FDNY), CareFlight, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Sacco Score, and Unadjusted Sacco Score. Methods for approximating triage systems were vetted by subject matter experts. Triage assignments were compared against patient mortality at hospital discharge with area under the receiver operator curve. Secondary outcomes included death in the emergency department, use of a ventilator, and lengths of stay. Subgroup analysis assessed triage accuracy in patients by age, trauma type, and sex. RESULTS: In this study, 530,695 records were included. The Sacco Score predicted mortality most accurately, with area under the receiver operator curve of 0.883 (95% confidence interval 0.880 to 0.885), and performed well in most subgroups. FDNY was more accurate than START for adults but less accurate for children. CareFlight was best for burn victims, with area under the receiver operator curve of 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.89) but mistriaged more salvageable trauma patients to "dead/black" (41% survived) than did other disaster triage methods ( approximately 10% survived). CONCLUSION: Among 6 disaster triage methods compared against actual outcomes in trauma registry patients, the Sacco Score predicted mortality most accurately. This analysis highlighted comparative strengths and weakness of START, FDNY, CareFlight, and Sacco, suggesting areas in which each might be improved. The GCS predicted outcomes similarly to dedicated disaster triage strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: Though many mass-casualty triage methods have been proposed, few have been validated in an evidence-based manner. The Sacco Triage Method (STM) has been shown to accurately stratify adult victims of blunt and penetrating trauma into groups of increasing mortality risk. However, it has not been validated for pediatric trauma victims. PURPOSE: Evaluate the STM's performance in pediatric trauma victims. METHODS: Records from the United States' National Trauma Data Base, a registry of trauma victims developed by the American College of Surgeons, were extracted for the 2007-2009 reporting years. Patients </= 18 years of age transported from a trauma scene with complete initial scene data were included in the analysis. Sacco triage scores were assigned to each registry patient, and receiver-operator curves were developed for predicting mortality, along with several secondary outcomes. Area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) was the main outcome statistic. Sensitivity analysis was performed using a Sacco score without age adjustment, using blunt versus penetrating trauma, and using patients <12 years of age. RESULTS: There were 210,175 pediatric records, of which 90,037 had complete data for analysis. The STM with age adjustment predicted pediatric trauma mortality with an AUC of 0.933 (95% CI: 0.925-0.940). Without the age adjustment term, it predicted mortality with an AUC of 0.924 (95% CI: 0.916-0.933). The STM with age adjustment predicted blunt trauma mortality in 72,467 patients with an AUC of 0.938 (95% CI: 0.929-0.947) and penetrating trauma mortality in 10,099 patients with an AUC of 0.927 (95% CI: 0.911-0.943). These findings did not change significantly when analysis was limited to patients <12 years of age. The Sacco Triage Method was also predictive of some secondary outcomes, such as major injury and death on arrival to the emergency department. CONCLUSION: The Sacco Triage Method, with or without its age adjustment term, was a highly accurate predictor of mortality in pediatric trauma patients in this registry database. This triage method appears to be a valid strategy for the prioritization of injured children.},

  Abstract                 = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the commonest cause of acquired disability in childhood. A major obstacle to the evaluation of acute and rehabilitative therapies after TBI is the lack of simple descriptors of outcome. We developed the King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI), as a specific paediatric adaptation of the original adult Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). The KOSCHI expands the five category GOS to provide increased sensitivity at the milder end of the disability range. The GOS category of "persistent vegetative state" was replaced by "vegetative". "Good recovery" was allocated two categories, in acknowledgement of the long term importance of relatively minor sequelae in a developing child. The scale was quick and easy to use. Inter-rater reliability studies show that even with such an apparently simple scale, some training may be required. The KOSCHI provides a practical scale for paediatric head injury which will enable clinicians to describe rate and extent of recovery, and evaluate the effects of service and research interventions.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluated long-term clinical outcomes and postoperative physiological findings in acutely comatose patients with nonmissile surgical intraparenchymal temporal lobe hemorrhages and abnormal pupillary widening who received early preoperative high-dose mannitol (HDM) versus conventional dose mannitol treatment in the emergency room. METHODS: One hundred forty-one adult patients with traumatic, nonmissile, acute, intraparenchymal temporal lobe hemorrhages associated with early abnormal pupillary widening were prospectively and randomly assigned to receive emergency preoperative intravenous HDM treatment (approximately 1.4 g/kg; 72 patients) and were compared with a control group that was treated with a lower preoperative mannitol dose (approximately 0.7 g/kg; 69 patients). RESULTS: Early preoperative improvement of abnormal bilateral pupillary widening was significantly more frequent in the study group than in the control group (P < 0.03). The same was true for abnormal unilateral pupillary widening (P < 0.01). Early HDM treatment in the emergency room was also associated with significantly better 6-month clinical outcomes (P < 0.005). The two groups of patients were well matched with respect to diameter of the temporal lobe hemorrhages (approximately 4 cm) as well as timing of clot removal (approximately 2.5 hours after injury). Postoperative physiological findings revealed statistically significant between-group differences, with higher intracranial pressure and lower cerebral extraction of oxygen (global relative cerebral hyperperfusion) in the control group than in the HDM group. Postoperative global brain ischemia (abnormally low arteriojugular lactate difference values) was rare and was found for less than 3% of the patients in both groups. CONCLUSION: Early preoperative HDM administration in the emergency room was associated with improved clinical outcomes for adult comatose patients with acute, nonmissile, intraparenchymal temporal lobe hemorrhages and associated abnormal pupillary widening. Early improvement of bilateral or unilateral pupillary abnormalities and better postoperative control of intracranial hypertension and associated global relative cerebral hyperperfusion seemed to be relevant factors that were related to improved outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECT: The authors evaluated long-term clinical outcomes in selected acutely comatose patients with severe diffuse brain swelling and recent clinical signs of impending brain death who received a novel high-dose mannitol treatment compared with those who received conventional-dose mannitol in the emergency room. METHODS: Forty-four adult patients with traumatic, nonmissile-inflicted, acute, severe diffuse brain swelling were prospectively and randomly evaluated. All patients were selected based on the presence of recent clinical signs of impending brain death on the first emergency room evaluation. These signs included bilateral abnormal pupillary widening and lack of motor responses to painful stimulation (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3). The study group (23 patients) received ultra-early and fast intravenous high-dose mannitol treatment (approximately 1.4 g/kg), whereas the control group (21 patients) received half that dose (approximately 0.7 g/kg). Ultra-early improvement of bilateral abnormal pupillary widening was significantly more frequent in the high-dose mannitol group than in the conventional-dose group (p < 0.02). High-dose mannitol treatment in the emergency room was also associated with significantly better 6-month clinical outcomes (p < 0.02); the best rate of favorable outcomes was 43.5%, compared with only 9.5% in the conventional-dose mannitol group. The two groups of patients were well matched with respect to all emergency room and head computerized tomography findings, as well as the timing of initial mannitol treatment (approximately 80-90 minutes after the first evaluation at the scene of the injury). Comparative evaluation of bilateral pupillary widening between the scene of the injury and the emergency room showed no significant differences between groups, whereas mannitol dose dependence was statistically significant (p < 0.05), insofar as early pupillary improvement in the emergency room was concerned. CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-early high-dose mannitol administration in the emergency room is the first known treatment strategy significantly to reverse recent clinical signs of impending brain death, and also to contribute directly to improved long-term clinical outcomes for these patients who have previously been considered unsalvageable.},

METHODS: A population-based case-control study using a linked file of birth and death certificates for the years 1981 through 1990. RESULTS: The leading causes of infant injury death, per 100,000 live births, were intentional injury (9.1); suffocation, choking, or hanging (6.9); motor vehicle crashes (4.4); and drowning (3.2). Unintentional injury death rates fell steeply during the 1970s but remained steady during the 1980s. Infanticide rates rose during the 1980s. Young maternal age (odds ratio, 9.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.5 to 17.9, for age < 20 years vs age > 30 years) and higher parity (odds ratio, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.1 to 8.3, for parity of two or more vs parity of zero) were associated with infant injury death. There was a twofold increase in the risk of infant injury death if the mother smoked, was black, or lived in a rural area. Male sex of the infant, late prenatal care, and low income were associated only with intentional deaths, while higher parity was more strongly associated with unintentional injury deaths. CONCLUSIONS: During 1981 through 1990, infant mortality caused by injuries increased in Washington State. Young maternal age and higher parity were strongly associated with infant injury death.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that fetuses at risk for sudden death may have abnormal conduction or depolarization, ischemia, or abnormal heart rate variability (HRV) detectable by magnetocardiography. METHODS: Using a 37-channel biomagnetometer, we evaluated 3 groups of fetuses at risk for sudden death: group 1, critical aortic stenosis (AS); group 2, arrhythmias; and group 3, heart failure and in utero demise. Five to 10 recordings of 10-minute duration were recorded, and signal was averaged to determine rhythm, conduction intervals, HRV, and T-wave morphology. RESULTS: In group 1, 2 of 3 had atrial and ventricular strain patterns. In (n = 53) group 2, 15% had prolonged QTc and 17% had T-wave alternans (TWA). Of 23 group 2 fetuses with atrioventricular block, 74% had ventricular ectopy, 21% had junctional ectopic tachycardia, and 29% had ventricular tachycardia. Group 3 (n = 2) had abnormal HRV and TWA. CONCLUSION: Repolarization abnormalities, unexpected arrhythmias, and abnormal HRV suggest an arrhythmogenic mechanism for "sudden cardiac death before birth."},

  Abstract                 = {Terbutaline is used to treat fetal bradycardia in the setting of complete heart block (CHB); however, little is known of its effects on atrial and ventricular beat rates or patterns of heart rate (HR) acceleration. Fetal atrial and ventricular beat rates were compared before and after transplacental terbutaline treatment (10 to 30 mg/day) by fetal echocardiography in 17 fetuses with CHB caused by immune-mediated damage to a normal conduction system (isoimmune, n = 8) or a congenitally malformed conduction system associated with left atrial isomerism (LAI, n = 9). While receiving terbutaline, 9 of the 17 fetuses underwent fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) to assess maternal HR and rhythm, patterns of fetal HR acceleration, and correlation between fetal atrial and ventricular accelerations (i.e., AV correlation). Maternal HR and fetal atrial and ventricular beat rates increased with terbutaline. However, terbutaline's effects were greater on the atrial pacemaker(s) in fetuses with isoimmune CHB and greater on the ventricular pacemaker(s) in those with LAI-associated CHB. Patterns of fetal HR acceleration also differed between isoimmune and LAI CHB. Finally, despite increasing HR, terbutaline did not restore the normal coordinated response between atrial and ventricular accelerations in isoimmune or LAI CHB. In conclusion, the pathophysiologic heterogeneity of CHB is reflected in the differing effect of terbutaline on the atrial and ventricular pacemaker(s) and varying patterns of HR acceleration. However, regardless of the cause of CHB, terbutaline augments HR but not AV correlation, suggesting that its effects are determined by the conduction system defect rather than the autonomic control of the developing heart.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Bleeding complications are a serious adverse effect of medications that prevent abnormal blood clotting. To facilitate epidemiologic investigations of bleeding complications, we developed and validated an automated database case definition for bleeding-related hospitalizations. METHODS: The case definition utilized information from an in-progress retrospective cohort study of warfarin-related bleeding in Tennessee Medicaid enrollees 30 years of age or older. It identified inpatient stays during the study period of January 1990 to December 2005 with diagnoses and/or procedures that indicated a current episode of bleeding. The definition was validated by medical record review for a sample of 236 hospitalizations. RESULTS: We reviewed 186 hospitalizations that had medical records with sufficient information for adjudication. Of these, 165 (89%, 95%CI: 83-92%) were clinically confirmed bleeding-related hospitalizations. An additional 19 hospitalizations (10%, 7-15%) were adjudicated as possibly bleeding-related. Of the 165 clinically confirmed bleeding-related hospitalizations, the automated database and clinical definitions had concordant anatomical sites (gastrointestinal, cerebral, genitourinary, other) for 163 (99%, 96-100%). For those hospitalizations with sufficient information to distinguish between upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding, the concordance was 89% (76-96%) for upper gastrointestinal sites and 91% (77-97%) for lower gastrointestinal sites. CONCLUSION: A case definition for bleeding-related hospitalizations suitable for automated databases had a positive predictive value of between 89% and 99% and could distinguish specific bleeding sites.

  Abstract                 = {A computerized bibliographic search of published research and a citation review of English-language publications about prone positioning of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome were done. Information on prone positioning related to technique, patients' responses, complications, and recommendations to prevent complications was extracted. In the 20 pertinent clinical studies found, 297 patients (mean age, 39 years) with acute respiratory failure were positioned prone. Timing from the onset of respiratory failure to when the patient was first positioned prone varied, as did the frequency of prone positioning. Patients spent from 30 minutes to 42 hours prone. In 47% of the studies in which abdominal position was noted, chest and pelvic cushions were used to allow the abdomen to protrude while the patient was prone. Improved oxygenation within 2 hours was reported in 69% of patients, and the improvements were cumulative and persistent. Aside from early intervention, factors predictive of patients' responses were inconsistent, and patients' initial responses were not predictive of subsequent responses. Iatrogenic critical events were rare. Dependent edema of the face was prevalent. Pressure ulcers were reported in studies with longer periods of prone positioning. The most serious complication, corneal abrasion requiring corneal transplantation, was reported in one patient. Clinical knowledge about prone positioning is limited. Phase 1 studies focusing on how to safely turn and care for critically ill patients positioned prone for prolonged periods are needed.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: This paper describes the methodology of a clinical trial of prone positioning in pediatric patients with acute lung injury (ALI). Nonrandomized studies suggest that prone positioning improves oxygenation in patients with ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome without the risk of serious iatrogenic injury. It is not known if these improvements in oxygenation result in improvements in clinical outcomes. A clinical trial was needed to answer this question. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pediatric prone study is a multicenter, randomized, noncrossover, controlled clinical trial. The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that at the end of 28 days, children with ALI treated with prone positioning will have more ventilator-free days than children treated with supine positioning. Secondary end points include the time to recovery of lung injury, organ failure-free days, functional outcome, adverse events, and mortality from all causes. Pediatric patients, 42 weeks postconceptual age to 18 years of age, are enrolled within 48 hours of meeting ALI criteria. Patients randomized to the prone group are positioned prone within 4 hours of randomization and remain prone for 20 hours each day during the acute phase of their illness for a maximum of 7 days. Both groups are managed according to ventilator protocol, extubation readiness testing, and sedation protocols and hemodynamic, nutrition, and skin care guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes the process, multidisciplinary input, and procedures used to support the design of the clinical trial, as well as the challenges faced by the clinical scientists during the conduct of the clinical trial.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: In uncontrolled clinical studies, prone positioning appeared to be safe and to improve oxygenation in pediatric patients with acute lung injury. However, the effect of prone positioning on clinical outcomes in children is not known. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that at the end of 28 days infants and children with acute lung injury treated with prone positioning would have more ventilator-free days than those treated with supine positioning. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted from August 28, 2001, to April 23, 2004, of 102 pediatric patients from 7 US pediatric intensive care units aged 2 weeks to 18 years who were treated with supine vs prone positioning. Randomization was concealed and group assignment was not blinded. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to either supine or prone positioning within 48 hours of meeting acute lung injury criteria, with those patients in the prone group being positioned within 4 hours of randomization and remaining prone for 20 hours each day during the acute phase of their illness for a maximum of 7 days, after which they were positioned supine. Both groups were treated using lung protective ventilator and sedation protocols, extubation readiness testing, and hemodynamic, nutrition, and skin care guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Ventilator-free days to day 28. RESULTS: The trial was stopped at the planned interim analysis on the basis of the prespecified futility stopping rule. There were no differences in the number of ventilator-free days between the 2 groups (mean [SD], 15.8 [8.5] supine vs 15.6 [8.6] prone; mean difference, -0.2 days; 95% CI, -3.6 to 3.2; P = .91). After controlling for age, Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score, direct vs indirect acute lung injury, and mode of mechanical ventilation at enrollment, the adjusted difference in ventilator-free days was 0.3 days (95% CI, -3.0 to 3.5; P = .87). There were no differences in the secondary end points, including proportion alive and ventilator-free on day 28 (P = .45), mortality from all causes (P>.99), the time to recovery of lung injury (P = .78), organ-failure-free days (P = .88), and cognitive impairment (P = .16) or overall functional health (P = .12) at hospital discharge or on day 28. CONCLUSION: Prone positioning does not significantly reduce ventilator-free days or improve other clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with acute lung injury.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe the physiologic changes and to evaluate the safety of placing pediatric patients with acute lung injury (ALI) prone for 20 h/d during the acute phase of their illness. DESIGN: Single-center prospective case series. SETTING: Tertiary-level pediatric ICU. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with bilateral pulmonary parenchymal disease requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation with a PaO(2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO(2)) ratio </= 300 mm Hg. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were enrolled as soon as possible after meeting criteria and were placed in a prone position for 20 h/d daily until clinical improvement or death occurred. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five pediatric patients who had ALI/ARDS, ranging in age from 2 months to 17 years, were placed in a prone position within 19 h of meeting the study criteria for a median time of 4 days, which accounted for 47% of their time receiving mechanical ventilation. Eighty-four percent of patients (n = 21) were categorized as overall responders to prone positioning because they experienced more days of increases of >/= 20 mm Hg in PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio or a decrease of >/= 10% in oxygenation index when shifted from a supine to a prone position during the study period. During the 107 patient-days and 214 positioning cycles, no critical incidents occurred. Furthermore, no patient experienced a persistent decrease in oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) of > 10% from values obtained when in the supine position, failed to keep their SpO(2) at > 85%, or experienced an increased respiratory rate of > 40 breaths/min when prone. Using the COMFORT score, patients were objectively rated to be equally comfortable in both the supine and prone positions. Patients also were able to resume spontaneous ventilation and to progress toward endotracheal extubation while in the prone position. Iatrogenic injury associated with prolonged prone positioning included stage II pressure ulcers in six patients (24%). CONCLUSIONS: The pediatric patients in this series demonstrated improvements in oxygenation without serious iatrogenic injury after prone positioning. This study provides a foundation for a prospective randomized study investigating the effect of early and repeated prone positioning on clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with ALI.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Participation in clinical registries is nonrandom, so participants may differ in important ways from nonparticipants. The extent to which findings from clinical registries can be generalized to broader populations is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We linked data from the Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) registry with 100% inpatient Medicare fee-for-service claims to identify matched and unmatched patients with heart failure. We evaluated differences in baseline characteristics and mortality, all-cause readmission, and cardiovascular readmission rates. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine relationships between registry enrollment and outcomes, controlling for baseline characteristics. There were 25,245 OPTIMIZE-HF patients in the Medicare claims data and 929,161 Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure who were not enrolled in OPTIMIZE-HF. Although hospital characteristics differed, patient demographic characteristics and comorbid conditions were similar. In-hospital mortality for OPTIMIZE-HF and non-OPTIMIZE-HF patients was not significantly different (4.7% versus 4.5%; P=0.37); however, OPTIMIZE-HF patients had slightly higher 30-day (11.9% versus 11.2%; P<0.001) and 1-year unadjusted mortality (37.2% versus 35.7%; P<0.001). Controlling for other variables, OPTIMIZE-HF patients were similar to non-OPTIMIZE-HF patients for the hazard of mortality (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.98 to 1.06). There were small but significant decreases in all-cause (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.97) and cardiovascular readmission (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics and outcomes of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in OPTIMIZE-HF are similar to the broader Medicare population with heart failure, suggesting that findings from this clinical registry may be generalized.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To identify factors predicting acute hospital discharge disposition after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Secondary analysis of existing datasets. SETTING: Acute care hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Adults hospitalized with moderate to severe TBI included in 3 large sets of archival data: (1) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Central Nervous System Injury Surveillance database (n=15,646); (2) the National Trauma Data Bank (n=52,012); and (3) the National Study on the Costs and Outcomes of Trauma (n=1286). INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Discharge disposition from acute hospitalization to 1 of 3 postacute settings: (1) home, (2) inpatient rehabilitation, or (3) subacute settings, including nursing homes and similar facilities. RESULTS: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and length of acute hospital length of stay (LOS) accounted for 35% to 44% of the variance in discharges to home versus not home, while age and sex added from 5% to 8%, and race/ethnicity and hospitalization payment source added another 2% to 5%. When predicting discharge to rehabilitation versus subacute care for those not going home, GCS and LOS accounted for 2% to 4% of the variance, while age and sex added 7% to 31%, and race/ethnicity and payment source added 4% to 5%. Across the datasets, longer LOS, older age, and white race increased the likelihood of not being discharged home; the most consistent predictor of discharge to rehabilitation was younger age. CONCLUSIONS: The decision to discharge to home a person with moderate to severe TBI appears to be based primarily on severity-related factors. In contrast, the decision to discharge to rehabilitation rather than to subacute care appears to reflect sociobiologic and socioeconomic factors; however, generalizability of these results is limited by the restricted range of potentially important variables available for analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of the Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM-2) for pediatric cardiac surgery patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).
DESIGN: : Retrospective cohort analysis.
SETTING: Multi-institutional PICUs.
PATIENTS: Children whose PICU admission had an associated cardiac surgical procedure.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Performance of the PIM-2 was evaluated with both discrimination and calibration measures. Discrimination was assessed with a receiver operating characteristic curve and associated area under the curve measurement. Calibration was measured across defined groups based on mortality risk, using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Analyses were performed initially, using the entire cohort, and then based on operative status (perioperative defined as procedure occurring within 24 hrs of PICU admission and preoperative as occurring >24 hrs from the time of PICU admission). A total of 9,208 patients were identified as cardiac surgery patients with 8,391 (91%) considered as perioperative. Average age of the entire cohort was 3.3 yrs (median, 10 mos, 0-18 yrs), although preoperative children tended to be younger (median, <1 month). Preoperative patients also had longer PICU median lengths of stay than perioperative patients (12 days [1-375 days] vs. 3 days [1-369 days], respectively). For the entire cohort, the PIM-2 had fair discrimination power (area under the curve, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.83) and poor calibration (p < .0001). Its predictive ability was similarly inadequate for quality assessment (standardized mortality ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.90) with significant overprediction in the highest-decile risk group. For the subpopulations, the model continued to perform poorly with low area under the curves for preoperative patients and poor calibration for both groups. PIM-2 tended to overpredict mortality for perioperative patients and underpredict for preoperative patients (standardized mortality ratios, 0.69 [95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.78] and 1.48 [95% confidence interval, 1.27-1.70], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The PIM-2 demonstrated poor performance with fair discrimination, poor calibration, and predictive ability for pediatric cardiac surgery population and thus cannot be recommended in its current form as an adequate adjustment tool for quality measurement in this patient group.},

  Abstract                 = {In observational studies, investigators have no control over the treatment assignment. The treated and non-treated (that is, control) groups may have large differences on their observed covariates, and these differences can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects. Even traditional covariance analysis adjustments may be inadequate to eliminate this bias. The propensity score, defined as the conditional probability of being treated given the covariates, can be used to balance the covariates in the two groups, and therefore reduce this bias. In order to estimate the propensity score, one must model the distribution of the treatment indicator variable given the observed covariates. Once estimated the propensity score can be used to reduce bias through matching, stratification (subclassification), regression adjustment, or some combination of all three. In this tutorial we discuss the uses of propensity score methods for bias reduction, give references to the literature and illustrate the uses through applied examples.},

For each case, two controls presenting with influenza-like illness but without severe outcomes were included: one random control and one age matched control.Severe outcomes included death or admission to intensive care for assisted ventilation, inotropic support, or both. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to compare cases and controls, with effect sizes measured as adjusted odds ratios.151 (57\%) of the 265 cases were male, the median age was 6 (interquartile range 2.3-10.0) years, and 27 (10\%) died. Six factors were associated with severe outcomes in children presenting with influenza-like illness: history of chronic lung disease (odds ratio 10.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.5 to 69.8), history of cerebral palsy/developmental delay (10.2, 2.0 to 51.4), signs of chest retractions (9.6, 3.2 to 29.0), signs of dehydration (8.8, 1.6 to 49.3), requirement for oxygen (5.8, 2.0 to 16.2), and tachycardia relative to age).These independent risk factors may alert clinicians to children at risk of severe outcomes when presenting with influenza-like illness during future pandemics.},

The iron metabolism imbalances described or reported in all intensive care studies are similar to the values observed in anemia of inflammation. The administration of iron could be useful in the optimization of recombinant human erythropoietin activity, but this could be at the expense of bacterial proliferation. Since there is a lack of evidence to support either oral or intravenous iron administration in intensive care patients, further studies are necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of iron supplementation in conjunction with recombinant human erythropoietin in critically ill patients. We review the mechanisms leading to iron sequestration in the presence of inflammation. The present article also reviews the literature describing the iron status in critically ill patients and explores the role of iron supplementation in this setting.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Fetal echocardiography is widely established in the United Kingdom for prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease. This may result in a substantial reduction in incidence at birth because of selected termination of pregnancy. The objective of this population-based study was to determine the incidence of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS) at birth, the impact of fetal echocardiography on this incidence, and to compare the outcome of cases with and those without prenatal diagnosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: From 1991 to 1995, all infants born with PAIVS and all fetal diagnoses in the United Kingdom and Eire were studied. There were 183 live births (incidence 4.5/100,000 live births). The incidence was 4.1 cases per 100,000 live births in England and Wales, 4.7 in Scotland, 6.8 in Eire, and 9.6 in Northern Ireland (P=0.01). There were 86 fetal diagnoses made at a mean of 22.0 weeks of gestation leading to 53 terminations of pregnancy (61%), 4 intrauterine deaths (5%), and 29 live births (34%). The incidence at birth would be 5.6 per 100,000 births in England and Wales, 5.3 in Scotland, and unchanged in Eire and Northern Ireland, if there were no terminations of pregnancy and assuming no further spontaneous fetal deaths (P=0.28). An initial diagnosis of critical pulmonary stenosis was made in 6 cases, at a mean of 22.3 weeks of gestation with progression to PAIVS by 31.4 weeks. Probability of survival at 1 year was 65% and was the same for live-born infants whether or not a fetal diagnosis had been made. CONCLUSIONS: PAIVS is rare, occurring in 1 in 22,000 live births in the United Kingdom and Eire. Termination of pregnancy has resulted in an important reduction in the live-born incidence in mainland Britain.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the possibility of improving nocturnal glycemic control as well as meal glycemic response using closed-loop therapy in children aged <7 years. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a randomized controlled crossover trial comparing closed-loop with standard open-loop insulin pump therapy performed in an inpatient clinical research center. Ten subjects aged <7 years with type 1 diabetes for >6 months treated with insulin pump therapy were studied. Closed-loop therapy and standard open-loop therapy were compared from 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. on 2 consecutive days. The primary outcome was plasma glucose time in range (110-200 mg/dL) during the night (10:00 p.m.-8:00 a.m.). Secondary outcomes included peak postprandial glucose levels, incidence of hypoglycemia, degree of hyperglycemia, and prelunch glucose levels. RESULTS: A trend toward a higher mean nocturnal time within target range was noted for closed- versus open-loop therapy, although not reaching statistical significance (5.3 vs. 3.2 h, P = 0.12). There was no difference in peak postprandial glucose or number of episodes of hypoglycemia. There was significant improvement in time spent >300 mg/dL overnight with closed-loop therapy (0.18 vs. 1.3 h, P = 0.035) and the total area under the curve of glucose >200 mg/dL (P = 0.049). Closed-loop therapy returned prelunch blood glucose closer to target (189 vs. 273 mg/dL on open loop, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Closed-loop insulin delivery decreases the severity of overnight hyperglycemia without increasing the incidence of hypoglycemia. The therapy is better able to reestablish target glucose levels in advance of a subsequent meal. Younger children with type 1 diabetes may reap significant benefits from closed-loop therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To develop clinical practice guidelines for the support of the patient and family in the adult, pediatric, or neonatal patient-centered ICU. PARTICIPANTS: A multidisciplinary task force of experts in critical care practice was convened from the membership of the American College of Critical Care Medicine (ACCM) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) to include representation from adult, pediatric, and neonatal intensive care units. EVIDENCE: The task force members reviewed the published literature. The Cochrane library, Cinahl, and MedLine were queried for articles published between 1980 and 2003. Studies were scored according to Cochrane methodology. Where evidence did not exist or was of a low level, consensus was derived from expert opinion. CONSENSUS PROCESS: The topic was divided into subheadings: decision making, family coping, staff stress related to family interactions, cultural support, spiritual/religious support, family visitation, family presence on rounds, family presence at resuscitation, family environment of care, and palliative care. Each section was led by one task force member. Each section draft was reviewed by the group and debated until consensus was achieved. The draft document was reviewed by a committee of the Board of Regents of the ACCM. After steering committee approval, the draft was approved by the SCCM Council and was again subjected to peer review by this journal. CONCLUSIONS: More than 300 related studies were reviewed. However, the level of evidence in most cases is at Cochrane level 4 or 5, indicating the need for further research. Forty-three recommendations are presented that include, but are not limited to, endorsement of a shared decision-making model, early and repeated care conferencing to reduce family stress and improve consistency in communication, honoring culturally appropriate requests for truth-telling and informed refusal, spiritual support, staff education and debriefing to minimize the impact of family interactions on staff health, family presence at both rounds and resuscitation, open flexible visitation, way-finding and family-friendly signage, and family support before, during, and after a death.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether spouses of patients with severe sepsis are at increased risk for depression independent of the spouse's presepsis history, whether this risk differs by sex, and is associated with a sepsis patient's disability after hospitalization. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Population-based cohort of U.S. adults over 50 yrs old interviewed as part of the Health and Retirement Study (1993-2008). PATIENTS: Nine hundred twenty-nine patient-spouse dyads comprising 1,212 hospitalizations for severe sepsis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Severe sepsis was identified using a validated algorithm in Medicare claims. Depression was assessed with a modified version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. All analyses were stratified by gender. The prevalence of substantial depressive symptoms in wives of patients with severe sepsis increased by 14 percentage points at the time of severe sepsis (from 20% at a median of 1.1 yrs presepsis to 34% at a median of 1 yr postsepsis) with an odds ratio of 3.74 (95% confidence interval: 2.20, 6.37), in multivariable regression. Husbands had an 8 percentage point increase in the prevalence of substantial depressive symptoms, which was not significant in multivariable regression (odds ratio 1.90, 95% confidence interval 0.75, 4.71). The increase in depression was not explained by bereavement; women had greater odds of substantial depressive symptoms even when their spouse survived a severe sepsis hospitalization (odds ratio 2.86, 95% confidence interval 1.06, 7.73). Wives of sepsis survivors who were disabled were more likely to be depressed (odds ratio 1.35 per activities of daily living limitation of sepsis survivor, 95% confidence interval 1.12, 1.64); however, controlling for patient disability only slightly attenuated the association between sepsis and wives' depression (odds ratio 2.61, 95% confidence interval 0.93, 7.38). CONCLUSIONS: Older women may be at greater risk for depression if their spouse is hospitalized for severe sepsis. Spouses of patients with severe sepsis may benefit from greater support and depression screening, both when their loved one dies and when their loved one survives.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that presepsis depressive symptoms are associated with risk of new cognitive impairment in survivors of severe sepsis. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Population-based cohort of older U.S. adults interviewed as part of the Health and Retirement Study (1998-2006). PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred forty-seven individuals with normal presepsis cognition who survived 540 hospitalizations for severe sepsis and completed at least one follow-up interview. MEASUREMENTS: Severe sepsis was identified using a validated algorithm in Medicare claims. Depressive symptoms were assessed prospectively using a modified version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Cognitive function was assessed using versions of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS). Logistic regression with robust standard errors was used to examine associations between substantial depressive symptoms at any interview before sepsis and incident cognitive impairment (mild or moderate to severe cognitive impairment) at any interview after sepsis. RESULTS: The prevalence of substantial depressive symptoms in participants with normal cognition before sepsis was 38% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 34-42%). After severe sepsis, 18% (95% CI = 15-20%) of survivors had incident cognitive impairment. In unadjusted analyses, presepsis substantial depressive symptoms were associated with postsepsis incident cognitive impairment (odds ratio (OR) = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.53-4.27). After adjustment for demographics, health-risk behaviors, clinical characteristics of the sepsis episode, and presepsis TICS scores, substantial presepsis depressive symptoms remained the strongest factor associated with postsepsis incident cognitive impairment (OR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.45-4.59). CONCLUSION: Substantial presepsis depressive symptoms are independently associated with incident postsepsis cognitive impairment. Depressed older adults may be particularly at risk of developing cognitive impairment after a serious medical illness.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES:: To examine if incident severe sepsis is associated with increased risk of subsequent depressive symptoms and to assess which patient characteristics are associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms. DESIGN:: Prospective longitudinal cohort study. SETTING:: Population-based cohort of older U.S. adults interviewed as part of the Health and Retirement Study (1998-2006). PARTICIPANTS:: A total of 439 patients who survived 471 hospitalizations for severe sepsis and completed at least one follow-up interview. MEASUREMENTS:: Depressive symptoms were assessed with a modified version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Severe sepsis was identified using a validated algorithm in Medicare claims. RESULTS:: The point prevalence of substantial depressive symptoms was 28% at a median of 1.2 years before sepsis, and remained 28% at a median of 0.9 years after sepsis. Neither incident severe sepsis (relative risk [RR]: 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73, 1.34) nor severe sepsis-related clinical characteristics were significantly associated with subsequent depressive symptoms. These results were robust to potential threats from missing data or alternative outcome definitions. After adjustment, presepsis substantial depressive symptoms (RR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.66, 2.90) and worse postsepsis functional impairment (RR: 1.08 per new limitation; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.13) were independently associated with substantial depressive symptoms after sepsis. CONCLUSIONS:: The prevalence of substantial depressive symptoms in severe sepsis survivors is high but is not increased relative to their presepsis levels. Identifying this large subset of severe sepsis survivors at increased risk for major depression, and beginning interventions before hospital discharge, may improve outcomes.},

The most commonly assessed psychiatric disorders were posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression. The point prevalence of clinically significant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms ranged from 10\% to 28\% (5 studies). The point prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms ranged from 7\% to 13\% (2 studies). Preillness psychiatric and/or developmental problems and parental psychopathology were associated with vulnerability to psychiatric morbidity. Neither age nor sex of a child consistently increased vulnerability to postillness psychopathology. Exposure to increased severity of medical illness and pediatric intensive care unit service-delivery characteristics (eg, invasive procedures) were predictors of psychiatric illness in some but not all studies.

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Emergency medical services (EMS) is an important part of the health care system. The effect of EMS on morbidity, mortality, and costs of illness is difficult to evaluate because hospital information is not available in out-of-hospital databases. We used probabilistic linkage to create such a database from ambulance and inpatient data and demonstrate the potential for linkage to facilitate evaluation of EMS responses resulting in hospital admission. METHODS: Statewide ambulance and inpatient hospital discharge records were available for 1994 through 1996. Ambulance records indicating admission to the emergency department or hospital (165,649 records) were linked to inpatient hospital records indicating emergency admission (146,292 records) by using probabilistic linkage. Out-of-hospital data (dispatch code, treatments rendered, and ages), linkage rates, and inpatient data (discharge status, charges, length of stay, and payer category) were analyzed. RESULTS: We linked 24,299 (14.7%) ambulance events to inpatient hospital discharges. If we had used exact linkage methods, we would have only linked 14,621 record pairs, a loss of nearly 40%. Linkage rates were relatively constant between years (approximately 15%) but differed by ambulance dispatch codes. Out-of-hospital dispatch codes with high linkage rates included breathing problems (22.6%), chest pain (21.5%), diabetic problems (16.9%), drowning incidents (14.9%), falls (19.2%), strokes (32.8%), and unconsciousness or fainting episodes (16.1%). Linkage to the hospital record provided access to hospital outcome data. Inpatient mortality was 6.8%. Survivors were discharged home (60.7%), transferred to other acute-care facilities (3.6%) or intermediate-care facilities (23.3%), or discharged with home health care provision (4.9%). The median length of stay was 3 days, and median charges were $6,620; total inpatient charges were $286,737,067. CONCLUSION: Probabilistic linkage enables ambulance and hospital discharge records to be linked together and potentially increases our ability to critically evaluate EMS by providing access to hospital-based outcomes. Such evaluation will be further improved by linking to ED, other outpatient, and other public health data sources.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECT: The aim of this study was to evaluate physician agreement with published recommendations and guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children and to identify markers associated with physician responses matching published guidelines. METHODS: An Internet survey was created based on recommendations and guidelines published in 2003 and was sent to US physicians and neurosurgeons caring for pediatric patients with severe TBI. Agreement with each recommendation was tabulated. Characteristics of the surveyed physicians and their institutions were compared to identify markers of conformity with first-tier recommendations (intracranial pressure [ICP] treatment threshold, monitoring cerebral perfusion pressure, use of sedation/neuromuscular blockade, and use of hyperosmolar therapy). RESULTS: One hundred ninety-four US physicians responded: 36 neurosurgeons and 158 nonsurgeons. Overall, physician responses matched most recommendations more than 60% of the time. The serum osmolality threshold of hypertonic saline, use of prophylactic hyperventilation, and differences in ICP thresholds based on a child's age comprised the recommendations with the least agreement. No physician variable was linked to increased agreement with first-tier recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, physician responses coincided with the published guidelines and recommendations. Examples of variable conformance most likely reflect the paucity of available data and lack of randomized controlled trials in the field of severe TBI.},

Rates of true matches were validated using medical records. We examined rates of emergency department (ED) visits, hospital readmissions, potentially preventable readmissions (PPR), and hospital charges within one year of the NSQIP-Peds encounter.Of the 2,409 NSQIP-Peds and 61,147 PHIS records, 93.6\% met match criteria with 92.5\% being true matches. Post-operative ED visit rates were 7.8\% within 30days, 17.2\% between 31-180days, and 18.1\% between 181-365days. Readmission rates were 5.5\% within 30days, 9.3\% between 31-180days, and 8.4\% between 181-365days. In patients undergoing inpatient procedures, 10.6\% had readmissions within 30days, and 23.7\% had readmissions within 365days that were potentially preventable.Using indirect identifiers, a linked NSQIP-Peds-PHIS dataset demonstrated high rates of ED visits, readmissions, and PPR in the first post-operative year. This dataset may provide a more comprehensive way to study health care utilization and clinical outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Mortality rate of patients admitted to Intensive Care Units is a widely adopted outcome indicator. Because of large case-mix variability, comparisons of mortality rates must be adjusted for the severity of patient illness at admission. The Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM-2) has been widely adopted as a tool for adjusting mortality rate by patients' case mix. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of PIM-2 in children admitted to intensive care units after cardiac surgery, other surgery, or for other reasons. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study, conducted in a 607 inpatient-bed tertiary-care pediatric hospital in Italy, with three pediatric intensive care Units (PICUs) and one cardiac Unit (CICU). In 2009--11, all consecutive admissions to PICUs/CICU of children aged 0--16 years were included in the study. Discrimination and calibration measures were computed to assess PIM-2 performance. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of patients' main reason for intensive care admission (cardiac-surgical, other-surgical, medical), age, Unit and year with observed mortality, adjusting for PIM-2 score. RESULTS: PIM-2 data collection was completed for 91.2% of total PICUs/CICU patient admissions (2912), and for 94.8% of patients who died in PICUs/CICU (129). Overall observed mortality was 4.4% (95%CI, 3.7-5.2), compared to 6.4% (95%CI, 5.5-7.3) expected mortality. Standardised mortality ratio was 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6-0.8). PIM-2 discrimination was fair (area under the curve, 0.79; 95%CI: 0.75-0.83). Calibration was less satisfactory, mainly because of the over two-fold overprediction of deaths in the highest risk group (114.7 vs 53; p < 0.001), and particularly in cardiac-surgical patients. Multivariable logistic analysis showed that risk of death was significantly reduced in cardiac-surgical patients and in those aged 1 month to 12 years, independently from PIM-2. CONCLUSIONS: The children age distribution and the proportion of cardiac-surgical patients should be taken into account when interpreting SMRs estimated using the PIM-2 prediction model in different Units. A new calibration study of PIM-2 score might be needed, and more appropriate cardiac-focused risk-adjustment models should be developed. The role of age on risk of death needs to be further explored.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock," published in 2004. DESIGN: Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding. METHODS: We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations. RESULTS: Key recommendations, listed by category, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7-10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure > or = 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for postoperative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7-9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B), targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); and a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B). CONCLUSIONS: There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the development of a guideline for the management of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) based on local microbiologic findings and to evaluate the impact of the guideline on antimicrobial use practices. DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of antimicrobial use practices before and after implementation of the guideline. SETTING: Intensive care units at Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, a university-affiliated urban teaching hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 819 patients who received mechanical ventilation and who underwent quantitative bronchoscopy between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2005, for suspected VAP. INTERVENTIONS: Implementation of an evidence-based VAP guideline that focused on the use of quantitative bronchoscopy for diagnosis, administration of empirical antimicrobial therapy based on local microbiologic findings and resistance patterns, tailoring definitive antimicrobial therapy on the basis of culture results, and appropriate duration of therapy. RESULTS: During the baseline period, 168 (46.7%) of 360 patients had quantitative cultures that met the diagnostic criteria for VAP, compared with 216 (47.1%) of 459 patients in the period after the guideline was implemented. The pathogens responsible for VAP remained similar between the 2 periods, except that the prevalence of VAP due to carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter species increased from 1.8% to 15.3% (P<.001), particularly in late-onset VAP. Compared with the baseline period, there was an improvement in antimicrobial use practices after implementation of the guideline: antimicrobial therapy was more frequently tailored on the basis of quantitative culture results (103 [61.3%] of 168 vs 150 [69.4%] of 216 patients; P = .034), there was an increase in the use of appropriate definitive therapy (135 [80.4%] of 168 vs 193 [89.4%] of 216 patients; P = .001), and there was a decrease in the mean duration of therapy (12.0 vs 10.7 days; P = .0014). The all-cause mortality rate was similar in the periods before and after the guideline was implemented (38 [22.6%] of 168 vs 46 [21.3%] of 216 patients; P = .756). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a guideline for the management of VAP that incorporated the use of quantitative bronchoscopy, the use of empirical therapy based on local microbiologic findings, tailoring of therapy on the basis of culture results, and use of shortened durations of therapy led to significant improvements in antimicrobial use practices without adversely affecting the all-cause mortality rate.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: We assessed the prognostic value and limitations of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and head Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) and correlated head AIS with GCS. STUDY DESIGN: We studied 7,764 patients with head injuries. Bivariate analysis was performed to examine the relationship of GCS, head AIS, age, gender, and mechanism of injury with mortality. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent risk factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: The overall mortality in the group of head injury patients with no other major extracranial injuries and no hypotension on admission was 9.3%. Logistic regression analysis identified head AIS, GCS, age, and mechanism of injury as significant independent risk factors of death. The prognostic value of GCS and head AIS was significantly affected by the mechanism of injury and the age of the patient. Patients with similar GCS or head AIS but different mechanisms of injury or ages had significantly different outcomes. The adjusted odds ratio of death in penetrating trauma was 5.2 (3.9, 7.0), p < 0.0001, and in the age group > or = 55 years the adjusted odds ratio was 3.4 (2.6, 4.6), p < 0.0001. There was no correlation between head AIS and GCS (correlation coefficient -0.31). CONCLUSIONS: Mechanism of injury and age have a major effect in the predictive value of GCS and head AIS. There is no good correlation between GCS and head AIS.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of American College of Surgeons (ACS) trauma center designation and trauma volume on outcome in patients with specific severe injuries. BACKGROUND: Trauma centers are designated by the ACS into different levels on the basis of resources, trauma volume, and educational and research commitment. The criteria for trauma center designation are arbitrary and have never been validated. METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank study, which included patients >14 years of age and had injury severity score (ISS) >15, were alive on admission and had at least one of the following severe injuries: aortic, vena cava, iliac vessels, cardiac, grade IV/V liver injuries, quadriplegia, or complex pelvic fractures. Outcomes (mortality, intensive care unit stay, and severe disability at discharge) were compared among level I and II trauma centers and between centers within the same level designation but different volumes of severe trauma (<240 vs > or =240 trauma admissions with ISS >15 per year). The outcomes were adjusted for age (<65 > or =65), gender, mechanism of injury, hypotension on admission, and ISS (< or =25 and >25). RESULTS: A total of 12,254 patients met the inclusion criteria. Overall, level I centers had significantly lower mortality (25.3% vs 29.3%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.94; P = 0.004) and significantly lower severe disability at discharge (20.3% vs 33.8%, adjusted OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.44-0.69; P < 0.001) than level II centers. Subgroup analysis showed that cardiovascular injuries (N = 2004) and grades IV-V liver injuries (N = 1415) had a significantly better survival in level I than level II trauma centers (adjusted P = 0.017 and 0.023, respectively). Overall, there was a significantly better functional outcome in level I centers (adjusted P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed level I centers had significantly better functional outcomes in complex pelvic fractures (P < 0.001) and a trend toward better outcomes in the rest of the subgroups. The volume of trauma admissions with ISS >15 (<240 vs > or =240 cases per year) had no effect on outcome in either level I or II centers. CONCLUSIONS: Level I trauma centers have better outcomes than lower-level centers in patients with specific injuries associated with high mortality and poor functional outcomes. The volume of major trauma admissions does not influence outcome in either level I or II centers. These findings may have significant implications in the planning of trauma systems and the billing of services according to level of accreditation.},

Some authors advocate the Wald test and some the likelihood-ratio test. We argue that the Wald test should be used because the Z-score is commonly applied for regression coefficient significance testing and therefore the same statistic should be used in the power function. We correct a widespread mistake on sample size determination when the variance of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is estimated at null value. In our previous paper, we developed a correct sample size formula for logistic regression with single exposure (Statist. Med. 2007; 26(18):3385-3397). In the present paper, closed-form formulas are derived for interaction studies with binary exposure and covariate in logistic regression. The formula for the optimal control-case ratio is derived such that it maximizes the power function given other parameters.

  Abstract                 = {There is no consensus on the approach to compute the power and sample size with logistic regression. Some authors use the likelihood ratio test; some use the test on proportions; some suggest various approximations to handle the multivariate case. We advocate the use of the Wald test since the Z-score is routinely used for statistical significance testing of regression coefficients. The null-variance formula became popular from early studies, which contradicts modern software, which utilizes the method of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), when the variance of the MLE is estimated at the MLE, not at the null. We derive general Wald-based power and sample size formulas for logistic regression and then apply them to binary exposure and confounder to obtain a closed-form expression. These formulas are applied to minimize the total sample size in a case-control study to achieve a given power by optimizing the ratio of controls to cases. Approximately, the optimal number of controls to cases is equal to the square root of the alternative odds ratio.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that influence primary care residents to become generalists or specialists. DESIGN: Structured survey and interview. SETTING: A large university-based, internal medicine residency program in primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Of 92 residency graduates who completed training between 1979 and 1993, 88 (96%) participated. MAIN RESULTS: Although 82% of the participating graduates reported themselves very committed to primary care at the beginning of residency, only 68% pursued generalist careers. Factors influencing career choice that were more important to generalists than specialists included breadth of knowledge used in primary care practice (p = .04), breadth of clinical problems in practice (p = .001), and opportunity for continuity of care (p = .01). Although salary was rated "not important," 50% of generalists and specialists advocated increased salaries for generalists as a way to increase interest in primary care. Other promoting factors included mentors, increased prestige for generalists, community-based training, lifestyle changes, and decreased paperwork. Seventy-three percent of participants felt it was easier to be a specialist than a generalist. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial minority of primary care residents pursue specialty careers. To produce more generalists, graduates recommend addressing income inequities, providing generalist role models, increasing community-based teaching, and increasing prestige for generalists.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: In recent decades, the fastest growth in lumbar surgery occurred in older patients with spinal stenosis. Trials indicate that for selected patients, decompressive surgery offers an advantage over nonoperative treatment, but surgeons often recommend more invasive fusion procedures. Comorbidity is common in older patients, so benefits and risks must be carefully weighed in the choice of surgical procedure. OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in use of different types of stenosis operations and the association of complications and resource use with surgical complexity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort analysis of Medicare claims for 2002-2007, focusing on 2007 to assess complications and resource use in US hospitals. Operations for Medicare recipients undergoing surgery for lumbar stenosis (n = 32,152 in the first 11 months of 2007) were grouped into 3 gradations of invasiveness: decompression alone, simple fusion (1 or 2 disk levels, single surgical approach), or complex fusion (more than 2 disk levels or combined anterior and posterior approach). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of the 3 types of surgery, major complications, postoperative mortality, and resource use. RESULTS: Overall, surgical rates declined slightly from 2002-2007, but the rate of complex fusion procedures increased 15-fold, from 1.3 to 19.9 per 100,000 beneficiaries. Life-threatening complications increased with increasing surgical invasiveness, from 2.3% among patients having decompression alone to 5.6% among those having complex fusions. After adjustment for age, comorbidity, previous spine surgery, and other features, the odds ratio (OR) of life-threatening complications for complex fusion compared with decompression alone was 2.95 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.50-3.49). A similar pattern was observed for rehospitalization within 30 days, which occurred for 7.8% of patients undergoing decompression and 13.0% having a complex fusion (adjusted OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.74-2.17). Adjusted mean hospital charges for complex fusion procedures were US $80,888 compared with US $23,724 for decompression alone. CONCLUSIONS: Among Medicare recipients, between 2002 and 2007, the frequency of complex fusion procedures for spinal stenosis increased while the frequency of decompression surgery and simple fusions decreased. In 2007, compared with decompression, simple fusion and complex fusion were associated with increased risk of major complications, 30-day mortality, and resource use.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to deliver high concentrations of antimicrobial agents directly to the site of pneumonia is attractive, especially with the availability of high-efficiency nebulizers. A major focus of inhaled antimicrobial therapy has been to prevent and treat ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP occurs commonly in mechanically ventilated patients and is associated with significant morbidity and high mortality. Moreover, the emergence of VAP due to multiple-drug-resistant Gram-negative organisms that are resistant to any form of systemic antimicrobial therapy has provided an impetus to explore inhaled antimicrobial treatment as an adjunct to systemic therapy. Tobramycin solution for inhalation and colistimethate sodium have been formulated for delivery via inhalation. Although these agents are being increasingly employed in intensive care units, the intricacies involved in their use are not appreciated by many clinicians. This review discusses the role of these agents in the prevention and treatment of VAP, with an emphasis on some of the problems associated with their use. Further research is needed to support the use of inhaled antimicrobial therapy in patients with VAP.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The open abdomen technique, after both military and civilian trauma, emergency general or vascular surgery, has been used in some form for the past 30 years. There have been several hundred citations on the indications and the management of the open abdomen. Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management committee convened a study group to organize the world's literature for the management of the open abdomen. This effort was divided into two parts: damage control and the management of the open abdomen. Only damage control is presented in this study. Part 1 is divided into indications for the open abdomen, temporary abdominal closure, staged abdominal repair, and nutrition support of the open abdomen. METHODS: A literature review was performed for more than 30 years. Prospective and retrospective studies were included. The reviews and case reports were excluded. Of 1,200 articles, 95 were selected. Seventeen surgeons reviewed the articles with four defined criteria. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma primer was used to grade the evidence. RESULTS: There was only one level I recommendation. A patient with documented abdominal compartment syndrome should undergo decompressive laparotomy. CONCLUSION: The open abdomen technique remains a heroic maneuver in the care of the critically ill trauma or surgical patient. For the best outcomes, a protocol for the indications, temporary abdominal closure, staged abdominal reconstruction, and nutrition support should be in place.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the impact of race and sex on outcome in children undergoing cardiac operations were based on analyses of administrative claims data. This study uses clinical registry data to examine potential associations of sex and race with outcomes in congenital cardiac operations, including in-hospital mortality, postoperative length of stay (LOS), and complications. METHODS: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (STS-CHSD) was queried for patients younger than 18 years undergoing cardiac operations from 2007 to 2009. Preoperative, operative, and outcome data were collected on 20,399 patients from 49 centers. In multivariable analysis, the association of race and sex with outcome was examined, adjusting for patient characteristics, operative risk (Society of Thoracic Surgeons-European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery [STAT] mortality category), and operating center. RESULTS: Median age at operation was 0.4 years (interquartile range 0.1-3.4 years), and 54.4% of patients were boys. Race/ethnicity included 54.9% white, 17.1% black, 16.4% Hispanic, and 11.7% "other." In adjusted analysis, black patients had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-2.04; p<0.001) and complication rate (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.04-1.26; p<0.01) in comparison with white patients. There was no significant difference in mortality or complications by sex. Girls had a shorter LOS than boys (-0.8 days; p<0.001), whereas black (+2.4 days; p<0.001) and Hispanic patients (0.9 days; p<0.01) had longer a LOS compared with white patients. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that black children have higher mortality, a longer LOS, and an increased complication rate. Girls had outcomes similar to those of boys but with a shorter LOS of almost a day. Further study of potential causes underlying these race and sex differences is warranted.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a population-based prospective cohort study, has been used to identify major risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease and stroke in the elderly. OBJECTIVE: To assess the external validity of the CHS. RESEARCH DESIGN: Comparison of the CHS cohort to a national cohort of Medicare beneficiaries and to Medicare beneficiaries residing in the CHS geographic regions. SUBJECTS: CHS participants and a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries. MEASURES: Demographic and administrative characteristics, comorbid conditions, resource use, and mortality. RESULTS: Compared with both Medicare cohorts, the CHS cohort was older and included more men and African American participants. CHS participants were more likely to be enrolled in Medicare managed care than beneficiaries in the national Medicare cohort. Compared with the Medicare cohorts, mortality in the CHS was more than 40% lower at 1 year, approximately 25% lower at 5 years, and approximately 15% lower at 10 years. There were minimal differences in comorbid conditions and health care resource use. CONCLUSION: The CHS cohort is comparable with the Medicare population, particularly with regard to comorbid conditions and resource use, but had lower mortality. The difference in mortality may reflect the CHS recruitment strategy or volunteer bias. These findings suggest it may not be appropriate to project absolute rates of disease and outcomes based on CHS data to the entire Medicare population. However, there is no reason to expect that the relative risks associated with physiologic processes identified by CHS data would differ for nonparticipants.},

  Abstract                 = {Mitochondrial morphological dynamics affect the outcome of ischemic heart damage and pathogenesis. Recently, mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) has been identified as a mediator of mitochondrial morphological changes and cell death during cardiac ischemic injury. In this study, we report a unique relationship between Pim-1 activity and Drp1 regulation of mitochondrial morphology in cardiomyocytes challenged by ischemic stress. Transgenic hearts overexpressing cardiac Pim-1 display reduction of total Drp1 protein levels, increased phosphorylation of Drp1-(S637), and inhibition of Drp1 localization to the mitochondria. Consistent with these findings, adenoviral-induced Pim-1 neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) retain a reticular mitochondrial phenotype after simulated ischemia (sI) and decreased Drp1 mitochondrial sequestration. Interestingly, adenovirus Pim-dominant negative NRCMs show increased expression of Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only protein p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), which has been previously shown to induce Drp1 accumulation at mitochondria and increase sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Overexpression of the p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis-dominant negative adenovirus attenuates localization of Drp1 to mitochondria in adenovirus Pim-dominant negative NRCMs promotes reticular mitochondrial morphology and inhibits cell death during sI. Therefore, Pim-1 activity prevents Drp1 compartmentalization to the mitochondria and preserves reticular mitochondrial morphology in response to sI.},

  Abstract                 = {Presented is a case series demonstrating that clinically significant language-related cognitive declines not detected by intelligence quotient (IQ) testing occur after left temporal lobectomy in school-aged children. In this series, comprehensive preoperative and postoperative neuropsychologic evaluations were completed in eight school-aged patients who underwent temporal lobectomy (five left, three right) for temporal lobe epilepsy. Mean age at surgery was 13 years, 11 months +/- 2 years, 1 month. Testing included measurement of IQ, verbal learning, naming, visual memory, sight word recognition, reading comprehension, and calculation. All five left temporal lobectomy patients demonstrated significant language-related cognitive declines on postoperative neuropsychologic testing, including deficits in verbal IQ (one patient), verbal learning (four patients), naming (one patient), and reading comprehension (one patient). These deficits were clinically evident in four of the five left temporal lobectomy patients, leading to declines in educational performance. IQ testing alone did not reliably identify these deficits. No significant declines were found after surgery in three right temporal lobectomy patients. Average or high preoperative functioning may have predisposed patients to postoperative deficits in this series, whereas magnetic resonance imaging or pathologic abnormalities did not protect against postoperative deficits. Outcome studies of temporal lobectomy in childhood should use comprehensive neuropsychologic testing to identify cognitive deficits.},

The study aim was to validate an ATOS III Triple Scan optical measurement system against a co-ordinate measuring machine using in vitro testing and to check repeatability under cadaver laboratory conditions. Two sizes of custom-made acetabular shells were deformed using a uniaxial/two-point loading frame and measured at different loads. Roundness measurements were performed using both the ATOS III Triple Scan optical system and a co-ordinate measuring machine and then compared. The repeatability was also tested by measuring shells pre- and post-insertion in a cadaver laboratory multiple times. The in vitro comparison with the co-ordinate measuring machine demonstrated a maximum difference of 5 microm at the rim and 9 microm at the measurement closest to the pole of the shell. Maximum repeatability was below 1 microm for the co-ordinate measuring machine and 3 microm for the ATOS III Triple Scan optical system. Repeatability was comparable between the pre-insertion (below 2 microm) and post-insertion (below 3 microm) measurements in the cadaver laboratory. This study supports the view that the ATOS III Triple Scan optical system fulfils the necessary requirements to accurately measure shell deformation in cadavers.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: Studies have demonstrated that the fatality risk for motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) is higher in rural than urban areas. The purpose of this study was to quantify the risk of a fatal outcome associated with a crash by the urban/rural classification of the driver's county of residence and the county of crash before and after adjusting for potentially confounding factors. METHODS: County of crash and driver's county of residence were classified as urban or rural for 514,648 Utah crash participants. Multivariate regression analysis was used to assess the impact of rural versus urban crash location on fatality outcomes for both urban and rural drivers. RESULTS: Before adjusting for confounding factors the relative risk of fatality in a rural versus urban crash was 9.7 (95% CI: 8.0-11.7) for urban drivers and their passengers compared to 1.8 (95% CI: 1.3-2.6) for rural residents. Adjustment for behavioral, road, and crash characteristics reduced risk estimates to 2.8 (95% CI: 2.2-3.5) and 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8-1.7), respectively. CONCLUSION: Urban and rural drivers may have distinct risk factors for MVC fatality in rural areas. Interventions to reduce the risk of fatality in rural areas should evaluate the needs of both urban and rural drivers.},

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A tertiary care pediatric cardiac intensive care unit and neonatal intensive care unit. PATIENTS: The medical records for all neonates (< or = 30 days of age) with heart disease admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit or neonatal intensive care unit between October 1, 2002, and September 30, 2003, were reviewed. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 190 neonates met inclusion criteria during this 1-yr period, of which 146 (77%) had at least one surgical procedure. Single ventricle heart disease was present in 42%. The most common mode of presentation was following a prenatal diagnosis (53%), followed by diagnosis in the newborn nursery (38%) and diagnosis after newborn hospital discharge (8%). The most common presenting findings in the newborn nursery were isolated murmur (38%) or cyanosis (32%), while circulatory collapse (38%) was the most common presentation after discharge. For the entire study cohort, 13% had a known genetic syndrome, 23% had a major noncardiac congenital anomaly, and 16% weighed < 2.5 kg. The hospital mortality for the entire cohort was 7.4%. Risk factors associated with an increased risk of hospital mortality included younger age at admission, higher number of cardiopulmonary bypass runs, and need for postoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Total hospital length of stay was > 1 month in 17% of neonates. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with complex congenital heart disease, including nearly half with single ventricle heart disease, neonatal hospital mortality was 7%. These patients have a high frequency of multiple congenital anomalies, genetic syndromes, low birth weight, and prolonged length of stay.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare outcomes in older individuals receiving drug-eluting stents (DES) and bare-metal stents (BMS). BACKGROUND: Comparative effectiveness of DES relative to BMS remains unclear. METHODS: Outcomes were evaluated in 262,700 patients from 650 National Cardiovascular Data Registry sites during 2004 to 2006 with procedural registry data linked to Medicare claims for follow-up. Outcomes including death, myocardial infarction (MI), revascularization, major bleeding, stroke, death or MI, death or MI or revascularization, and death or MI or stroke were compared with estimated cumulative incidence rates with inverse probability weighted estimators and Cox proportional hazards ratios. RESULTS: The DES were implanted in 217,675 patients and BMS were implanted in 45,025. At 30 months, DES patients had lower unadjusted rates of death (12.9% vs. 17.9%), MI (7.3 of 100 patients vs. 10.0 of 100 patients), and revascularization (23.0 of 100 patients vs. 24.5 of 100 patients) with no difference in stroke or bleeding. After adjustment, DES patients had lower rates of death (13.5% vs. 16.5%, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72 to 0.79, p < 0.001) and MI (7.5 of 100 patients vs. 8.9 of 100 patients, HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.81, p < 0.001), with minimal difference in revascularization (23.5 of 100 patients vs. 23.4 of 100 patients; HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.96), stroke (3.1 of 100 patients vs. 2.7 of 100 patients, HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.07), or bleeding (3.4 of 100 patients vs. 3.6 of 100 patients, HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.00). The DES survival benefit was observed in all subgroups analyzed and persisted throughout 30 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this largest ever real-world study, patients receiving DES had significantly better clinical outcomes than their BMS counterparts, without an associated increase in bleeding or stroke, throughout 30 months of follow-up and across all pre-specified subgroups.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Adult brain injury studies recommend maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) above 70 mm Hg. We evaluated CPP and outcome in brain-injured children. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the hospital courses of children at two Level I trauma centers who required insertion of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors for management of traumatic brain injury. ICP, CPP, and mean arterial pressure were evaluated hourly, and means were calculated for the first 48 hours after injury. RESULTS: Of 188 brain-injured children, 118 had ICP monitors placed within 24 hours of injury. They suffered severe brain injury, with average admitting Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 6 +/- 3. Overall mortality rate was 28%. No patient with mean CPP less than 40 mm Hg survived. Among patients with mean CPP in deciles of 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, or 70 mm Hg, no significant difference in Glasgow Outcome Scale distribution existed. CONCLUSION: Low mean CPP was lethal. In children with survivable brain injury (mean CPP > 40 mm Hg), CPP did not stratify patients for risk of adverse outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonrandomized comparative effectiveness studies contribute to clinical and biologic understanding of treatments by themselves, via subsequent confirmation in a more targeted randomized clinical trial, or through advances in basic science. Although methodological challenges and a lack of accepted principles to assess the quality of nonrandomized studies of comparative effectiveness have limited the practical use of these investigations, even imperfect studies can contribute useful information if they are thoughtfully designed, well conducted, carefully analyzed, and reported in a manner that addresses concerns from skeptical readers and reviewers. The GRACE (Good Research for Comparative Effectiveness) principles have been developed to help healthcare providers, researchers, journal readers, and editors evaluate the quality inherent in observational research studies of comparative effectiveness. The GRACE principles were developed by experienced academic and private sector researchers and were vetted over several years through presentation, critique, and consensus building among outcomes researchers, pharmacoepidemiologists, and other medical scientists and via formal review by the International Society of Pharmacoepidemiology. In contrast to other documents that guide systematic review and reporting, the GRACE principles are high-level concepts about good practice for nonrandomized comparative effectiveness research. The GRACE principles comprise a series of questions to guide evaluation. No scoring system is provided or encouraged, as interpretation of these observational studies requires weighing of all available evidence, tempered by judgment regarding the applicability of the studies to routine care.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Non-cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with bronchiectasis usually develop chronic bronchial infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) that is related to worsening lung function and increased morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether direct aerosol delivery of tobramycin to the lower airways may control infection and produce only low systemic toxicity. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial involving 30 patients was conducted to determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of 6-month tobramycin inhalation therapy. Patients received 300 mg of aerosolized tobramycin or placebo twice daily in 2 cycles, each for 6 months, with a one-month washout period. The number of exacerbations, number of hospital admissions, number of hospital admission days, antibiotic use, pulmonary function, quality of life, tobramycin toxicity, density of PA in sputum, emergence of bacterial resistance, and emergence of other opportunistic bacteria were recorded. RESULTS: The number of admissions and days of admission (mean +/- SD) during the tobramycin period (0.15 +/- 0.37 and 2.05 +/- 5.03) were lower than those during the placebo period (0.75 +/-1.16 and 12.65 +/- 21.8) (p < 0.047). A decrease in PA density in sputum was associated with tobramycin administration in the analysis of the first 6-month cycle (p = 0.038). No significant differences were observed in the number of exacerbations, antibiotic use, pulmonary function, and quality of life. The emergence of bacterial resistance and other bacteria did not differ between the 2 periods of study. Inhaled tobramycin was associated with bronchospasm in 3 patients, but not with detectable ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosol administration of high-dose tobramycin in non-CF bronchiectatic patients for endobronchial infection with PA appears to be safe and decreases the risk of hospitalization and PA density in sputum. Nevertheless, pulmonary function and quality of life are not improved, and the risk of bronchospasm is appreciable.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) designation with outcomes in patients, specifically those with severe traumatic brain injuries. DESIGN: A retrospective review. Logistic regression was performed for mortality, complications, and progression of initial neurologic insult. SETTING: Data from the National Trauma Data Bank. PATIENTS: A total of 16,037 patients with isolated severe head injury (head acute injury score, > or =3 and other body region abbreviated injury score, <3) classified into 2 groups (level 1 and level 2) according to ACS designation. RESULTS: Patients admitted to a level 2 center had higher mortality rates (13.9% vs 9.6%; P < .001), higher rates of complication (15.5% vs 10.6%; P < .001), and higher rates of progression of initial neurologic insult (2.0% vs 1.1%; P < .001). After adjustment for the factors that were different between the 2 groups, admission to a level 2 facility remained an independent predictor of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-1.75; P < .001), complications (adjusted OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.40-1.71; P < .001), and progression of neurologic insult (adjusted OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.37-2.31; P < .001). Other independent risk factors for mortality were penetrating mechanism, age of 55 years or older, Injury Severity Score of 20 or higher, Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or lower, and hypotension (systolic blood pressure, <90 mm Hg). CONCLUSION: Patients with severe traumatic brain injury treated in ACS-designated level 1 trauma centers have better survival rates and outcomes than those treated in ACS-designated level 2 centers.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the results of an integrated pre- and in-hospital approach to critical care in a large population of children with severe traumatic brain injury and to identify the early predictors of their outcome. DESIGN: A 9-yr retrospective review of the data of a trauma data bank. SETTING: Level III pediatric trauma center. PATIENTS: All children (1 month to 15 yrs) with severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale </=8) hospitalized in our trauma center and followed until death or for >/=6 months after discharge. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Univariate and further multivariate analyses were performed to determine independent predictive factors of death and outcome at discharge and 6 months later. The Glasgow Outcome Scale was used to evaluate outcome; a poor outcome referred to Glasgow Outcome Scale >/=3. Receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn to determine the threshold values of predictors of death and outcome. Analysis concerned 585 children (67% male and 33% female). Mean age was 7 +/- 5 yrs. Predominant mechanisms of injury were road traffic accidents and falls. Mean values for Glasgow Coma Scale, Pediatric Trauma Score, and Injury Severity Score were 6 (3-8), 3 (-4,10), and 28 (4-75), respectively. Mortality rate was 22%; Glasgow Outcome Scale was <3 in 53% of the cases at discharge and 60% at 6 months. Multivariate analysis identified Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity Score, and hypotension on arrival as independent predictors of death and poor outcome at discharge and at 6 months. Threshold values for death were 28 for Injury Severity Score and 5 for Glasgow Coma Scale. The same values were found for poor outcome, except for outcome at 6 months where threshold value for the Glasgow Coma Scale was 6. CONCLUSIONS: Initial hypotension, Glasgow Coma Scale, and Injury Severity Score are independent predictors of outcome in children with traumatic brain injury. Threshold values can be calculated for predicting poor outcome. These variables can be easily and detected early in this population and used for quality assessment.},

DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive study. Seventy-nine children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury were assessed at inpatient rehabilitation hospital admission and discharge by using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory's (PEDI) functional skills and caregiver assistance domains of self-care, mobility, and social function. RESULTS: Admission self-care functional levels were significantly greater than mobility and social function for both PEDI scales. At discharge, significant improvement was noted within all three domains and the amount of change between domains was significantly greater for the mobility domain on both scales. Age was not related to the amount of recovery. Admission functional status was moderately negatively correlated to the change in PEDI scores (ranging from r = -0.432 to -0.681). CONCLUSIONS: Variations exist in the recovery of self-care, mobility, and social function capability and independence during inpatient rehabilitation. Self-care was the least affected. Participants showed significant improvement in all domains, with the most recovery in mobility. Children with greater functional deficits demonstrated greater functional gains.},

This technical report provides a summary of the evidence in support of 5 recommendations for best practices to optimize safety in passenger vehicles for children from birth through adolescence that all pediatricians should know and promote in their routine practice. These recommendations are presented in the revised policy statement on child passenger safety in the form of an algorithm that is intended to facilitate their implementation by pediatricians with their patients and families. The algorithm is designed to cover the majority of situations that pediatricians will encounter in practice. In addition, a summary of evidence on a number of additional issues that affect the safety of children in motor vehicles, including the proper use and installation of child restraints, exposure to air bags, travel in pickup trucks, children left in or around vehicles, and the importance of restraint laws, is provided. Finally, this technical report provides pediatricians with a number of resources for additional information to use when providing anticipatory guidance to families.},

The objective of this pilot study was to develop and evaluate methods that could be utilized for supplemental child-specific data collection on a sample of cases identified through the NASS-GES program. Procedures were developed to identify a sample of police accident reports (PARs) involving child occupants for supplemental collection of child-specific data via three survey modes: phone, web-based and hard-copy self administered. Contact was initiated with 650 eligible parent drivers and surveys were completed by 156 (24.0%). Response rates were highest for telephone-based surveys (41.0% of those initially contacted by phone). Surveys were completed via the web by only 6.1% of those invited to do so. Overall agreement between survey and PAR data was good to excellent. Results of this pilot study indicate that creating procedures to identify cases for supplemental child-specific data collection based on the NASS-GES system is feasible. In order to sustain a supplemental child-focused data collection system that relies on identification of cases from NASS-GES, efforts must be made to enhance contact procedures in order to optimize response rates.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the performance of the ICD/AIS MAP (EJ MacKenzie et al) as a method of classifying injury severity for children. METHODS: Data on all children less than 16 years of age admitted to all designated trauma centers in Pennsylvania from January 1994 through October 1996 were obtained from the state trauma registry. The ICD/AIS MAP was used to convert all injury related ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes into abbreviated injury scale (AIS) score and injury severity score (ISS). Agreement between trauma registry AIS and ISS scores and MAP generated scores was assessed using the weighted kappa (kappaw) coefficient for ordered data and the intraclass correlation coefficient for continuous data. RESULTS: Agreement in ISS scores was excellent, both overall (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 0.89)), and when grouped into three levels of severity (kappaw= 0.86, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.87). Agreement in AIS scores across all body regions and ages was also excellent, (kappaw= 0.86 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.87). Agreement increased with age (kappaw= 0.78 for children <2 years; kappaw= 0.86 for older children) and varied by body region, though was excellent across all regions. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the ICD/AIS MAP in assessing severity of pediatric injuries was equal to or better than previous assessments of its performance on primarily adult patients. Its performance was excellent across the pediatric age range and across nearly all body regions of injury.},

  Abstract                 = {More than 1 million burn injuries occur in the United States each year and as many as half of these injuries require medical treatment. Most data used to describe burns are from national databases derived from random or purposive samples of injuries. Few studies describe burn rates within a state. Comprehensive descriptions of burns are warranted so as to develop and monitor tailored prevention programs and to educate health care providers. The purpose of this study was to identify and describe all burns requiring acute medical care in Utah to define burn prevention and care issues within the state. Probabilistic linkage of five databases was performed. Probabilistic linkage identified all burn injuries occurring in Utah during a 5-year period that were treated by EMS, admitted to an emergency department or hospital/burn center, or resulted in death. During the 5-year study period, 24,934 burns were identified. More men than women were injured (61% compared with 39%, respectively). One third of burns occurred to individuals aged younger than 18 years and 3% occurred to the elderly (>65 years). The majority of injuries were treated in the emergency department. Scald burns were the most common etiology. The mortality rate was 0.4%. The results of this study and future studies using this methodology may be used to identify populations at increased risk for burns and to target burn prevention and outreach medical education more appropriately.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of chronic conditions among children admitted to U.S. pediatric intensive care units and to assess whether patients with complex chronic conditions experience pediatric intensive care unit mortality and prolonged length of stay risk beyond that predicted by commonly used severity-of-illness risk-adjustment models.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort analysis of 52,791 pediatric admissions to 54 U.S. pediatric intensive care units that participated in the Virtual Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Systems database in 2008.
MEASUREMENTS: Hierarchical logistic regression models, clustered by pediatric intensive care unit site, for pediatric intensive care unit mortality and length of stay >15 days. Standardized mortality ratios adjusted for severity-of-illness score alone and with complex chronic conditions.
MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-three percent of pediatric intensive care unit admissions had complex chronic conditions, and 18.5% had noncomplex chronic conditions. The prevalence of these conditions and their organ system subcategories varied considerably across sites. The majority of complex chronic condition subcategories were associated with significantly greater odds of pediatric intensive care unit mortality (odds ratios 1.25-2.9, all p values < .02) compared to having a noncomplex chronic condition or no chronic condition, after controlling for age, gender, trauma, and severity-of-illness. Only respiratory, gastrointestinal, and rheumatologic/orthopedic/psychiatric complex chronic conditions were not associated with increased odds of pediatric intensive care unit mortality. All subcategories were significantly associated with prolonged length of stay. All noncomplex chronic condition subcategories were either not associated or were negatively associated with pediatric intensive care unit mortality, and most were not associated with prolonged length of stay, compared to having no chronic conditions. Among this group of pediatric intensive care units, adding complex chronic conditions to risk-adjustment models led to greater model accuracy but did not substantially change unit-level standardized mortality ratios.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with complex chronic conditions were at greater risk for pediatric intensive care unit mortality and prolonged length of stay than those with no chronic conditions, but the magnitude of risk varied across subcategories. Inclusion of complex chronic conditions into models of pediatric intensive care unit mortality improved model accuracy but had little impact on standardized mortality ratios.},

  Abstract                 = {MRC CRASH is a randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN74459797) of the effect of corticosteroids on death and disability after head injury. We randomly allocated 10,008 adults with head injury and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14 or less, within 8 h of injury, to a 48-h infusion of corticosteroid (methylprednisolone) or placebo. Data at 6 months were obtained for 9673 (96.7%) patients. The risk of death was higher in the corticosteroid group than in the placebo group (1248 [25.7%] vs 1075 [22.3%] deaths; relative risk 1.15, 95% CI 1.07-1.24; p=0.0001), as was the risk of death or severe disability (1828 [38.1%] vs 1728 [36.3%] dead or severely disabled; 1.05, 0.99-1.10; p=0.079). There was no evidence that the effect of corticosteroids differed by injury severity or time since injury. These results lend support to our earlier conclusion that corticosteroids should not be used routinely in the treatment of head injury.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Several efforts are under way to conduct quality-improvement initiatives in pediatric cardiology and cardiac surgery. Our goal was to develop an objective prioritization scheme for such initiatives based on encounter frequency and relative contribution of quality measures of morbidity (and associated variances), particularly in the setting of low mortality. METHODS: We identified patients in the Pediatric Health Information System in Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery 1 category 1 to 6 for 32 pediatric cardiac surgical procedures conducted between 2003 and 2011 (n = 67,550). These were examined for their overall contribution to mortality, intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay (coefficient of variation and excess days), adverse events, and readmission rates. A ranking scheme was created on the basis of the outcome measures. Then we ordered the procedures across metrics to develop a prioritization scheme. RESULTS: Observed mortality rates were consistent with published rates. A few procedures accounted for significant variation in hospital and intensive care length of stay across the hospitals. Likewise, a few procedures accounted for most excess days of stay and readmission rates. Up to 60% of the hospital stay was accounted for by intensive care unit stay. Although there was a linear relationship between adverse event rates and Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery 1 categories, a few procedures once again accounted for disproportionate event rates within and across their respective Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery 1 categories. CONCLUSIONS: A small number of procedures account for a substantial burden of morbidity, even among low mortality risk groups. Consideration should be given to using such objective prioritization schemes to develop targeted quality-improvement measures.},

METHOD: An occupational therapist evaluated 22 people with hemianopia, 8 with quadrantanopia, and 30 with normal vision for driving skills during naturalistic driving using six rating scales. RESULTS: Of drivers with normal vision, > 90% drove flawlessly or had minor errors. Although drivers with hemianopia were more likely to receive poorer ratings for all skills, 59.1%-81.8% performed with no or minor errors. A skill commonly problematic for them was lane keeping (40.9%). Of 8 drivers with quadrantanopia, 7 (87.5%) exhibited no or minor errors. CONCLUSION: This study of people with hemianopia or quadrantanopia with no lateral spatial neglect highlights the need to provide individual opportunities for on-road driving evaluation under natural traffic conditions if a person is motivated to return to driving after brain injury.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of survivors of critical illness are at risk for physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that may persist for months or years after hospital discharge. The post-intensive care syndrome framework encompassing these multidimensional morbidities was developed at the 2010 Society of Critical Care Medicine conference on improving long-term outcomes after critical illness for survivors and their families. OBJECTIVES: To report on engagement with non-critical care providers and survivors during the 2012 Society of Critical Care Medicine post-intensive care syndrome stakeholder conference. Task groups developed strategies and resources required for raising awareness and education, understanding and addressing barriers to clinical practice, and identifying research gaps and resources, aimed at improving patient and family outcomes. PARTICIPANTS: Representatives from 21 professional associations or health systems involved in the provision of both critical care and rehabilitation of ICU survivors in the United States and ICU survivors and family members. DESIGN: Stakeholder consensus meeting. Researchers presented summaries on morbidities for survivors and their families, whereas survivors presented their own experiences. MEETING OUTCOMES: Future steps were planned regarding 1) recognizing, preventing, and treating post-intensive care syndrome, 2) building strategies for institutional capacity to support and partner with survivors and families, and 3) understanding and addressing barriers to practice. There was recognition of the need for systematic and frequent assessment for post-intensive care syndrome across the continuum of care, including explicit "functional reconciliation" (assessing gaps between a patient's pre-ICU and current functional ability at all intra- and interinstitutional transitions of care). Future post-intensive care syndrome research topic areas were identified across the continuum of recovery: characterization of at-risk patients (including recognizing risk factors, mechanisms of injury, and optimal screening instruments), prevention and treatment interventions, and outcomes research for patients and families. CONCLUSIONS: Raising awareness of post-intensive care syndrome for the public and both critical care and non-critical care clinicians will inform a more coordinated approach to treatment and support during recovery after critical illness. Continued conceptual development and engagement with additional stakeholders is required.},

A questionnaire regarding medical conditions and medication was filled out by the patients themselves or their parents as was a 21-item questionnaire (PCSQ) regarding post-concussion symptoms. Of the surviving 165 individuals, 109 participated (67\%).Eight of 109 developed immediate seizures. During the follow-up period 12/109 had developed active epilepsy. Of these 12, five had had immediate seizures. The incidence of developing PTE within 10 years after a TBI was thus in this series 11\%. The relative risk to develop late onset post-traumatic epilepsy (> or =1 week after injury) for those who had had immediate seizures was 9.018 (p = 0.0003, 95\% CI = 3.69-22.05).TBI is a relatively rare cause of epilepsy in childhood, although immediate seizures are associated with an increased risk of developing post-traumatic epilepsy.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if a difference in survival exists between children of different racial/ethnic groups who were admitted to the PICU, after controlling for severity of illness (pediatric index of mortality 2).
METHODS: We used the largest national clinical PICU database (Virtual PICU Performance System) with data from 31 hospitals, from 2005 to 2008. Children 18 years and younger were included. We collected demographic, pediatric index of mortality 2, diagnosis, and PICU mortality data. Logistic regression models were constructed to identify PICU mortality risk factors.
RESULTS: The analysis of 80 739 patients revealed that, after controlling for severity of illness, being female (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.24] P = .019), 1 month or younger (OR: 1.39 [95% CI: 1.17-1.65] P < .001) or 12 years or older (OR: 1.34 [95% CI: 1.17-1.52] P < .001), or having an infectious diagnosis (OR: 2.22 [95% CI: 1.83-2.71] P < .001) or oncologic diagnosis (OR: 1.50 [95% CI: 1.14-1.99] P = .004) increased PICU mortality. Having "other" insurance type (OR: 1.58 [95% CI: 1.11-2.24] P = .010) or being Asian/Indian/Pacific Islander (OR: 1.35 [95% CI: 1.01-1.81] P = .042) seemed also to be mortality risk factors; however, because of heterogeneity and small group sizes (1.7% and 2.5% of the study population, respectively), these results are inconclusive.
CONCLUSIONS: Although gender, age, and diagnosis showed an effect on severity of illness-adjusted PICU mortality, race/ethnicity did not. Additional investigation is warranted because the present results (ie, insurance type) may be proxy measurements for other influences not collected in this database, such as sociocultural and socioeconomic factors.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Acute lung injury (ALI) is poorly defined in children. The objective of this prospective study was to clarify the incidence, demographics, management strategies, outcome, and mortality predictors of ALI in children in Australia and New Zealand. DESIGN: Multicenter prospective study during a 12-month period. SETTING: Intensive care unit. PATIENTS: All children admitted to intensive care and requiring mechanical ventilation were screened daily for development of ALI based on American-European Consensus Conference guidelines. Identified patients were followed for 28 days or until death or discharge. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 117 cases of ALI during the study period, giving a population incidence of 2.95/100,000 <16 yrs. ALI accounted for 2.2% of pediatric intensive care unit admissions. Mortality was 35% for ALI, and this accounted for 30% of all pediatric intensive care unit deaths during the study period. Significant preadmission risk factors for mortality were chronic disease, older age, and immunosuppression. Predictors of mortality during admission were ventilatory requirements (peak inspiratory pressures, mean airway pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure) and indexes of respiratory severity on day 1 (Pao2/Fio2 ratio and oxygenation index). Higher maximum and median tidal volumes were associated with reduced mortality, even when corrected for severity of lung disease. Development of single and multiple organ failure was significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: ALI in children is uncommon but has a high mortality rate. Risk factors for mortality are easily identified. Ventilatory variables and indexes of lung severity were significantly associated with mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is an autosomal recessive disorder of immune regulation. Mutations in the gene encoding perforin were previously identified in a subset of FHL patients. The present analysis of two novel candidate genes, granzyme B and granulysin, by direct sequencing in a total of 16 FHL families, disclosed several sequence variations. However, none of these sequence variations were associated with the manifestations of FHL. These data do not support the notion that granulysin and granzyme B are candidate genes for FHL.},

The work was done on Glossina tachinoides and G. palpalis gambiensis (Burkina Faso), G. fuscipes quanzensis (Democratic Republic of Congo), G. f. martinii (Tanzania) and G. f. fuscipes (Kenya). The killing effectiveness (measured as the catch per m(2) of cloth) for small targets plus flanking nets is 5.5-15X greater than for 1 m(2) targets and 8.6-37.5X greater than for biconical traps.

  Abstract                 = {The detection of the basic electric rhythm (BER), composed of a 3 cycles min(-1) oscillation, can be performed using SQUID magnetometers. However, the electric response activity (ERA), which is generated when the stomach is performing a mechanical activity, was detected mainly by invasive electrical measurements and only recently was one report published describing its detection by magnetic measurements. This study was performed with the aim of detecting the ERA noninvasively after a meal. MGG recordings were made with a 74-channel first-order gradiometer (Magnes II, biomagnetic technologies) housed in a shielded room. Seven nonsymptomatic volunteers were measured in the study. Initially a 10 min recording was performed with the subject in the fasted state. A 250 kcal meal was given to the subject without moving out of the magnetometers and two epochs of 10 min each were acquired. The signals were processed to remove cardiac interference by an algorithm based on a variation of independent component analysis (ICA), then autoregressive and wavelet analysis was performed. Preliminary results have shown that there is an increase in the signal power at higher frequencies around (0.6 Hz-1.3 Hz) usually associated with the basic electric rhythm. The center of the frequency band and its width varied from subject to subject, demonstrating the importance of pre-prandial acquisition as a control. Another interesting finding was an increase in power after about 5 min of meal ingestion. This period roughly agrees with the lag phase of gastric emptying, measured by scintigraphy and other techniques. We confirm that MGG can detect the electric response activity in normal volunteers. Further improvements in signal processing and standardization of signal acquisition are necessary to ascertain its possible use in clinical situations.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The pig kidney is similar in structure and function to the human kideny, thus making it a useful model in understanding the human kidney in health and disease. However, little is known about the branching pattern of the pig renal artery as compared with the human and other animals. METHODS: The right and left kidneys from 11 juvenile pigs were injected with either Mercox compound to form a vascular cast or contrast media to obtain a renal arteriogram. Branching patterns of the renal artery were then examined to the level of the interlobar arteries. RESULTS: Examination of all 22 kidneys showed the main stem renal artery branching into two predictable patterns, designated I and II. The renal artery in pattern I (17 of 22 kidneys) divides into upper and lower polar arteries that then form anterior and posterior segmental arteries. Pattern I has two variations. Pattern II (5 of 22 kidneys) has a variable blood flow to the upper pole. Not only do anterior and posterior segmental arteries pass to the upper pole, but additional vessels arising from the lower polar artery also supply the upper pole. CONCLUSIONS: The most common branching pattern of the main stem renal artery is pattern I, which divides the blood flow of the entire kidney into two distinct regions. Pattern II is less frequently seen and shows more variability in number and location of branches.},

  Abstract                 = {Prescribing antibiotics for perioperative prophylaxis in common surgical procedures presents an ideal target for educational intervention. In this situation, antibiotics are often used inappropriately, with consequent excess expense and risk of morbidity. We developed an educational intervention aimed at the choice and appropriate dosing of antibiotics for the prophylaxis of cesarean sections. Person-to-person educational messages targeted at authoritative senior department members were supplemented by brief reminders on a structured antibiotic order form. Time-series analyses were conducted on 34 months of antibiotic use data for 2,783 cesarean sections to estimate the trend of magnitude and significance of discontinuities associated with the start of the program. Prior to the intervention, 95% of sections receiving prophylaxis were given cefoxitin and 3% were given cefazolin. After the intervention, these proportions were reversed, with the shift in use occurring immediately after the intervention (p less than .001). Two years after the intervention, virtually all patients undergoing cesarean sections who receive antibiotic prophylaxis are given cefazolin. Savings from this change alone accounted for over $26,000 each year, or $47.36 per patient-day of prophylaxis. Substantial changes in prescribing practices for routine procedures can be accomplished through the implementation of a coordinated educational program that enlists influential senior staff members in a department in which policy-making is highly centralized, coupled with a structured educational ordering system. Lasting improvements in clinical practices may be brought about by means that are noncoercive, inexpensive and well-accepted by medical staff.},

The language-impaired TBI group had lower Verbal and Full-Scale IQ scores and produced fewer words and utterances than the sibling group on a story retelling task; their stories were characterized by fewer complete referential and lexical ties and more referential errors, indicating difficulty conjoining meaning across sentences. The language-impaired TBI group recalled approximately one-third of the propositions needed to maintain the story theme and made more errors sequencing the propositions than either the TBI or the sibling comparison groups. Group differences were not obtained on the Performance IQ scores or on measures of rate or fluency of speech production, mazes, use of conjunctives, or naming errors. The discourse deficiencies of children with TBI and acute language impairment were most pronounced at the level of cognitive organization of the text reflecting text macrostructure and were least apparent at the level of lexical and sentential organization reflecting text microstructure.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize neuroimaging, physical, neurobehavioral, and developmental findings in children with inflicted and noninflicted traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to identify characteristic features of inflicted TBI. METHODS AND PATIENTS: Forty children, 0 to 6 years of age, hospitalized for TBI who had no documented history of previous brain injury were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study. TBI was categorized as either inflicted (n = 20) or noninflicted (n = 20) based on the assessment of hospital and county protective services. Glasgow Coma Scale scores and neonatal history were comparable in both groups. OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging studies and physical findings were evaluated. Glasgow Outcome Scale scores, cognitive development, and motor functioning were assessed an average of 1.3 months after TBI. chi2 analyses assessed differences in the distribution of findings in the inflicted and noninflicted TBI groups. RESULTS: Signs of preexisting brain injury, including cerebral atrophy, subdural hygroma, and ex vacuo ventriculomegaly, were present in 45% of children with inflicted TBI and in none of the children with noninflicted TBI. Subdural hematomas and seizures occurred significantly more often in children with inflicted TBI. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage, edema, skull fractures, and cephalohematomas were similar in both groups. Retinal hemorrhage was only identified in the inflicted TBI group. Glasgow Outcome Scale scores indicated a significantly less favorable outcome after inflicted than noninflicted TBI. Mental deficiency was present in 45% of the inflicted and 5% of the noninflicted TBI groups. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristic features of inflicted TBI included acute computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging findings of preexisting brain injury, extraaxial hemorrhages, seizures, retinal hemorrhages, and significantly impaired cognitive function without prolonged impairment of consciousness.},

Twenty-eight children who were 2-42 months of age when hospitalized for moderate to severe TBI were enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal study of neurobehavioral outcome following acquired brain injury. Relative to a comparison group, the children with inflicted TBI had significant deficits in cognitive, motor and behavioral domains when assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II 1 and 3 months after the injury. Nearly half of the injured children showed persisting deficits in attention/arousal, emotional regulation and motor coordination. Greater injury severity, as indicated by lower coma scale scores, longer periods of unconsciousness and the presence of edema/cerebral infarctions was associated with poorer outcomes in all domains.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to assess the diagnostic value of different clinical criteria and the impact of microbiological testing on the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of suspected ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: Twenty five deceased mechanically ventilated patients were studied prospectively. Immediately after death, multiple bilateral lung biopsy specimens (16 specimens/patient) were obtained for histological examination and quantitative lung cultures. The presence of both histological pneumonia and positive lung cultures was used as a reference test. RESULTS: The presence of infiltrates on the chest radiograph and two of three clinical criteria (leucocytosis, purulent secretions, fever) had a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 75%; the corresponding numbers for the clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) were 77% and 42%. Non-invasive as well as invasive sampling techniques had comparable values. The combination of all techniques achieved a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 50%, and these values remained virtually unchanged despite the presence of previous treatment with antibiotics. When microbiological results were added to clinical criteria, adequate diagnoses originating from microbiological results which might have corrected false positive and false negative clinical judgements (n = 5) were countered by a similar proportion of inadequate diagnoses (n = 6). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical criteria had reasonable diagnostic values. CPIS was not superior to conventional clinical criteria. Non-invasive and invasive sampling techniques had diagnostic values comparable to clinical criteria. An algorithm guiding antibiotic treatment exclusively by microbiological results does not increase the overall diagnostic accuracy and carries the risk of undertreatment.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Although nosocomial pneumonia is a common problem in intubated and ventilated patients, previous studies have not clearly demonstrated that nosocomial pneumonia actually results in increased mortality or prolongs hospitalization of these patients. In an attempt to answer these questions, we have performed a cohort study in which patients who developed nosocomial pneumonia and control subjects were carefully matched for the severity of underlying illness and other important variables. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case patients were 48 ventilated patients with nosocomial pneumonia identified on the basis of results of protected specimen brush quantitative culture and identification of intracellular organisms in cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage. For matching cases and their respective controls, the following variables were used: age (+/- 5 years), Simplified Acute Physiologic Score (+/- 3 points), indication for ventilatory support, date of admission, and duration of exposure to risk. RESULTS: Successful matching was achieved for 222 of 240 (92.5%) variables. The mortality rate in cases was 26 of 48 (54.2%) compared with 13 of 48 (27.1%) in controls. The attributable mortality was 27.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.3% to 45.9%; p < 0.01) and the risk ratio for death was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.61 to 2.49). The mean length of stay was 34 days for cases and 21 days for controls (p < 0.02). In the case of pneumonia due to Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter species, the mortality rate was 71.4%, the attributable mortality was 42.8% (95% CI, 14.5% to 69.0%), and the risk ratio was 2.50 (95% CI, 1.31 to 4.61). CONCLUSION: Pneumonias occurring in ventilated patients, especially those due to Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter species, are associated with considerable mortality in excess of that resulting from the underlying disease alone, and significantly prolong the length of stay in the intensive care unit.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: The administration of prophylactic antibiotics via the respiratory tract is one of several strategies for the prevention of ICU-acquired pneumonia. We systematically examined the available evidence regarding the effect of prophylactic antibiotics administered via the respiratory tract on the development of ICU-acquired pneumonia, mortality, colonization of the respiratory tract, emergence of antimicrobial resistance, and toxicity. METHODS: We searched the PubMed database (1/1950 to 9/2005) and references from relevant articles to identify trials that provided comparative data regarding the above-mentioned outcomes. Two investigators independently performed the data extraction to calculate the effect of the studied intervention on clinically relevant outcomes. RESULTS: 8 comparative trials (5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 3 non-randomized trials) studying gentamicin (3 trials) polymyxins (3 trials), tobramycin (1 trial), and ceftazidime (1 trial) that studied 1,877 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Our primary analysis that included the 5 RCTs, revealed that ICU-acquired pneumonia was less common in the group of patients that received the antibiotic prophylaxis (OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.32-0.76). No difference in mortality was found between the compared groups (OR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.55-1.32). There were limited data to permit an analysis of colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A secondary analysis by adding the 3 non-randomized comparative trials did not reveal substantially different results regarding ICU-acquired pneumonia and mortality, while fewer patients were colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the group that received prophylaxis, compared to the group of patients that received no prophylaxis (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.30-0.86). No serious drug-related toxicity was noted. No meaningful systematic analysis of the evidence regarding the emergence of resistance could be performed in the studies included in our meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The limited available evidence supports that prophylactic administration of antibiotics via the respiratory tract is associated with reduction of occurrence of ICU-acquired pneumonia. However, there is evidence from non-comparative studies that this preventive strategy may lead to an increase in the emergence of resistant bacteria. Thus, further investigation, at least in ICU patients at high risk for development of ICU-acquired pneumonia is warranted, including a more systematic evaluation of issues related to the emergence of resistance.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: In a rural service area, does the outcome of air medical patients transferred from the scene of injury differ from that of patients transferred from a primary receiving hospital? METHODS: Retrospective review of all injured patients transported by air to a single trauma center during calendar year 1996. Data collected include basic patient demographics, time of injury, revised trauma score (RTS), injury severity score (ISS), probability of survival (PS), hospital length of stay (LOS), complications, disposition, and mortality. RESULTS: Concerning trauma admission, 594 of 1461 (40.7%) were transported by air: 363 from the scene (24.9%) and 231 from referring hospitals (15.8%). These two groups were similar in demographics, injury severity, hospital LOS, and crude mortality: RTS, 6.61 versus 6.68 (P > 0.05); ISS, 16.0 versus 16.0 (P > 0.05); LOS = 6.9 days versus 7.3 days (P > 0.05); mortality = 11.8% versus 10.8% (P > 0.05). The groups differed significantly, however, in time from injury to definitive care (34.2 minutes versus 196.2 minutes, P < 0.001), overall complication rate (39.1% versus 57.6%, P = 0.009), and potentially preventable deaths (PS > 0.5, 11.6% versus 44%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Patient groups were similar, suggesting similar triage criteria.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is frequently associated with the development of macrophage activation syndrome. This study was undertaken to better understand the relationship between systemic JIA and macrophage activation syndrome. METHODS: Gene expression profiles were examined in 17 patients with untreated new-onset systemic JIA, 5 of whom showed evidence of subclinical macrophage activation syndrome (of whom 2 eventually developed overt macrophage activation syndrome). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated on Ficoll gradients, and purified RNA was analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip expression arrays. A fraction of the PBMCs were used for flow cytometry to define the cellular composition of the samples. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-five differentially expressed genes (P < 0.05) that distinguished patients with systemic JIA from healthy controls (n = 30) were identified. Clustering analysis indicated that expression patterns correlated with serum ferritin levels. Three main clusters distinguished systemic JIA patients with highly elevated ferritin levels (including those with subclinical macrophage activation syndrome) from those with normal or only moderately elevated ferritin levels. The first cluster comprised genes involved in the synthesis of hemoglobins and structural proteins of erythrocytes. This transcriptional profile was consistent with immature nucleated red blood cells, likely reflective of high red blood cell turnover. Also included were transcripts indicating immature granulocytes. The second cluster was enriched for genes involved in cell cycle regulation. The third cluster was enriched for genes involved in innate immune responses, including those involved in the negative regulation of Toll-like receptor/interleukin-1 receptor-triggered inflammatory cascades and markers of the alternative pathway of macrophage differentiation. Additional differentially expressed genes of interest were those involved in the cytolytic pathway, including SH2D1A and Rab27a. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that gene expression profiling can be a useful tool for identifying early macrophage activation syndrome in patients with systemic JIA.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuromuscular complications of critical illness are common, and can be severe and persistent, with substantial impairment in physical function and long-term quality of life. While the etiology of ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) is multifactorial, both direct (ie, critical illness neuromyopathy) and indirect (ie, immobility/disuse atrophy) complications of critical illness contribute to it. ICUAW is often difficult to diagnose clinically during the acute phase of critical illness, due to the frequent use of deep sedation, encephalopathy, and delirium, which impair physical examination for patient strength. Despite its limitations, physical examination is the starting point for identification of ICUAW in the cooperative patient. Given the relative cost, invasiveness, and need for expertise, electrophysiological testing and/or muscle biopsy may be reserved for weak patients with slower than expected improvement on serial clinical examination. Currently there are limited interventions to prevent or treat ICUAW, with tight glycemic control having the greatest supporting evidence. There is a paucity of clinical trials evaluating the specific role of early rehabilitation in the chronic critically ill. However, a number of studies support the benefit of intensive rehabilitation in patients receiving chronic mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, emerging data demonstrate the safety, feasibility, and potential benefit of early mobility in critically ill patients, with the need for multicenter randomized trials to evaluate potential short- and long-term benefits of early mobility, including the potential to prevent the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation and/or the development of chronic critical illness, and other novel treatments on patients' muscle strength, physical function, quality of life, and resource utilization. Finally, the barriers, feasibility, and efficacy of early mobility in both medical and other ICUs (eg, surgical, neurological, pediatric), as well as in the chronic critically ill, have not been formally evaluated and require exploration in future clinical trials.},

METHODS: From a population of 2134 patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] Score <9), 1446 patients were treated with ICP-lowering therapies. Of those, 1202 had an ICP monitor inserted and 244 were treated without monitoring. Patients were admitted to one of 20 Level I and two Level II trauma centers, part of a New York State quality improvement program administered by the Brain Trauma Foundation between 2000 and 2009. This database also contains information on known independent early prognostic indicators of mortality, including age, admission GCS score, pupillary status, CT scanning findings, and hypotension. RESULTS: Age, initial GCS score, hypotension, and CT scan findings were associated with 2-week mortality. In addition, patients of all ages treated with an ICP monitor in place had lower mortality at 2 weeks (p = 0.02) than those treated without an ICP monitor, after adjusting for parameters that independently affect mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe TBI treated for intracranial hypertension, the use of an ICP monitor is associated with significantly lower mortality when compared with patients treated without an ICP monitor. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that ICP-directed therapy in patients with severe TBI should be guided by ICP monitoring.},

METHOD: This was a 4-week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, forced-dose titration study in adult participants, aged 18 to 55 years, meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) criteria for ADHD. RESULTS: Nearly all participants assigned to an LDX dose achieved their assigned dose with the exception of about 4% of participants assigned to the 50 mg or 14% assigned to the 70 mg doses. Higher doses of LDX led to greater improvements in ADHD-rating scale scores, independent of prior pharmacotherapy. This was evident for both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. The authors found some evidence for an interaction between LDX dose and baseline severity of ADHD symptoms. CONCLUSION: For LDX doses between 30 and 70 mg/d, the dose-response efficacy effect for LDX is not affected by prior pharmacotherapy, but patients with a greater severity of illness may benefit more from higher doses, especially for hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. The results do not provide information about doses above 70 mg/d, which is the maximum approved dose of LDX and the highest dose studied in ADHD clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate risk factors for poor functional outcome in 28-day survivors after an episode of severe sepsis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study examining data from the Researching Severe Sepsis and Organ Dysfunction in Children: A Global Perspective trial (NCT00049764). SETTING: One hundred and four pediatric centers in 18 countries. SUBJECTS: Children with severe sepsis who required both vasoactive-inotropic infusions and mechanical ventilation and who survived to 28 days (n = 384). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Poor functional outcome was defined as a Pediatric Overall Performance Category score greater than or equal to 3 and an increase from baseline when measured 28 days after trial enrollment. Median Pediatric Overall Performance Category at enrollment was 1 (interquartile range, 1-2). Median Pediatric Overall Performance Category at 28 days was 2 (interquartile range, 1-4). Thirty-four percent of survivors had decline in their functional status at 28 days, and 18% were determined to have a "poor" functional outcome. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with poor functional outcome compared to the white referent group (risk ratio = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0). Clinical factors associated with increased risk of poor outcome included CNS and intra-abdominal infection sources compared to the lung infection referent category (risk ratio = 3.3; 95% CI: 1.4-5.6 and 2.4; 95% CI: 1.0-4.5, respectively); a history of recent trauma (risk ratio = 3.9; 95% CI: 1.4-5.4); receipt of cardiopulmonary resuscitation prior to enrollment (risk ratio = 5.1; 95% CI: 2.9-5.7); and baseline Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score of 20-29 (risk ratio = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.2-5.2) and Pediatric Risk of Mortality III greater than or equal to 30 (risk ratio = 4.5; 95% CI: 1.6-8.0) compared to the referent group with Pediatric Risk of Mortality III scores of 0-9. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of 28-day survivors of pediatric severe sepsis diminished functional status was common. This analysis provides evidence that particular patient characteristics and aspects of an individual's clinical course are associated with poor functional outcome 28 days after onset of severe sepsis. These characteristics may provide opportunity for intervention in order to improve functional outcome in pediatric patients with severe sepsis. Decline in functional status 28 days after onset of severe sepsis is a frequent and potentially clinically meaningful event. Utilization of functional status as the primary outcome in future pediatric sepsis clinical trials should be considered.},

Nosology, based on the lineage of lesional cells and biological behavior, is related to the ontogeny of histiocytes (macrophages and dendritic cells of the immune system). Dendritic cell-related disorders of varied biological behavior are dominated by Langerhans cell histiocytosis, but separate secondary proliferations of dendritic cells must be differentiated. Juvenile xanthogranuloma represents a disorder of dermal dendrocytes, another dendritic cell of skin. The hemophagocytic syndromes are the most common of the macrophage-related disorders of varied biological behavior. Guidelines for distinguishing the exceedingly rare malignant diseases of histiocytes from large cell lymphomas through the use of a battery of special studies are provided.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective: Presentation of an unusual case of amnesic syndrome following a suspected AVM. The subject was a 14-year-old female (N) who suffered a large right temporo-parietal intra-parenchymal hemorrhage with extension into the ventricular system requiring surgical evacuation. She presented with a significant anterograde amnesic disorder that was generalized and not circumscribed to the visual domain. A neuropsychological assessment was recommended to investigate the nature and extent of her amnesic symptoms. Two aspects were found to be fundamental in this case, firstly, the inconsistency between the image findings of acute cerebral injury and her general amnesic disorder, and secondly, her capacity to keep up with academic demands despite persisting memory impairment. Method: N was assessed on four occasions over a period of 4 years to monitor her recovery. The initial assessment was comprehensive and covered intellectual functions, attention, processing speed, general memory, and executive functions. The subsequent reviews targeted for the most part the areas of impairment to evaluate the recovery process. Follow-up MRI findings were also reviewed. Results: The initial neuropsychological findings 5-6 weeks post-injury confirmed the presence of a moderate to severe impairment in general memory. Subsequent reviews indicated some gains overall, but she demonstrated persisting mild memory dysfunctions particularly in the area of visual memory. Conclusions: Ns general memory impairment was surprising given her right hemispheric injury. Her profile suggested some probable left hemispheric injury. Ns grades at school indicated that her mild memory impairments were not affecting her ability to keep up academically at a level that was consistent with her intellectual ability. The etiology of her memory impairment as well as the course of recovery over time will discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {AIM: Determine predictors of support of a mandatory seasonal influenza vaccine program among health care workers (HCWs). SCOPE: Cross-sectional anonymous survey of 2443 (out of 8093) randomly selected clinical and non-clinical HCWs at a large pediatric network after implementation of a mandatory vaccination program in 2009-10. RESULTS: 1388 HCWs (58.2%) completed the survey and 75.2% of respondents reported agreeing with the new mandatory policy. Most respondents (72%) believed that the policy was coercive but >90% agreed that the policy was important for protecting patients and staff and was part of professional ethical responsibility. When we adjusted for attitudes and beliefs regarding influenza and the mandate, there was no significant difference between clinical and nonclinical staff in their support of the mandate (OR 1.08, 95% C.I. 0.94, 1.26). CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes and beliefs regarding influenza and the mandate may transcend professional role. Targeted outreach activities can capitalize on beliefs regarding patient protection and ethical responsibility.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies in adults have shown a worse outcome associated with hyperoxia after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Extrapolating from adult data, current pediatric resuscitation guidelines recommend avoiding hyperoxia. We investigated the relationship between arterial partial oxygen pressure and survival in patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after cardiac arrest. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet) database between 2003 and 2010 (n=122,521). Patients aged <16 years with documented cardiac arrest preceding PICU admission and arterial blood gas analysis taken within 1 hour of PICU admission were included. The primary outcome measure was death within the PICU. The relationship between postarrest oxygen status and outcome was modeled with logistic regression, with nonlinearities explored via multivariable fractional polynomials. Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, congenital heart disease, out-of-hospital arrest, year, Pediatric Index of Mortality-2 (PIM2) mortality risk, and organ supportive therapies. Of 1875 patients, 735 (39%) died in PICU. Based on the first arterial gas, 207 patients (11%) had hyperoxia (Pa(O)(2) >/=300 mm Hg) and 448 (24%) had hypoxia (Pa(O)(2) <60 mm Hg). We found a significant nonlinear relationship between Pa(O)(2) and PICU mortality. After covariate adjustment, risk of death increased sharply with increasing hypoxia (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.80-2.21 at Pa(O)(2) of 23 mm Hg). There was also an association with increasing hyperoxia, although not as dramatic as that for hypoxia (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.37 at 600 mm Hg). We observed an increasing mortality risk with advancing age, which was more pronounced in the presence of congenital heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: Both severe hypoxia and, to a lesser extent, hyperoxia are associated with an increased risk of death after PICU admission after cardiac arrest.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of low inferior vena caval (LIVC) catheters for estimating central venous pressure in pediatric intensive care patients and to assess influences of intra-abdominal pressures and mean airway pressure on these measurements. DESIGN: Prospective cohort of consecutive patients. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Thirty patients ranging in age (18, 0-1 yrs; four, 1-3 yrs; four, 3-10 yrs; four, > or =10 yrs). INTERVENTIONS: Interventions included catheterizations via internal jugular, subclavian, and common femoral veins, as well as direct right atrial catheterization during surgery; arterial catheter placement; airway pressure monitoring during mechanical ventilation; indirect intra-abdominal pressure monitoring via bladder catheter pressure readings; and arterial and central venous blood gas analysis. LIVC vein catheters were placed below the origin of the renal veins. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: LIVC pressure was highly correlated with central venous pressure (n=30, r2=.965, p=.0001). LIVC pressure did not correlate with intra-abdominal pressure (n=18, r2=.000). Mean airway pressure did not correlate with central venous pressure (n=11, r2=.106). The pH of LIVC blood was similar to that of central venous blood (n=18, r2=.941, p=.0001). PCO2 values of inferior vena cava and central venous blood correlated (r2=.945, p=.0001). However, agreement between inferior vena cava and central venous PO2 and oxyhemoglobin saturation was poor (PO2, r2=.066; oxyhemoglobin saturation, r2=.000). CONCLUSIONS: LIVC catheters whose tips lie below the origin of the renal veins predict central venous pressure in pediatric intensive care unit patients. Intra-abdominal pressure and mean airway pressure do not affect this relationship, within the wide range of values for these variables included in this study. Blood samples drawn from femoral venous catheters can be used to monitor acid-base balance and partial pressure of carbon dioxide.},

  Abstract                 = {The pediatric complex chronic conditions (CCC) classification system, developed in 2000, requires revision to accommodate the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10). To update the CCC classification system, we incorporated ICD-9 diagnostic codes that had been either omitted or incorrectly specified in the original system, and then translated between ICD-9 and ICD-10 using General Equivalence Mappings (GEMs). We further reviewed all codes in the ICD-9 and ICD-10 systems to include both diagnostic and procedural codes indicative of technology dependence or organ transplantation. We applied the provisional CCC version 2 (v2) system to death certificate information and 2 databases of health utilization, reviewed the resulting CCC classifications, and corrected any misclassifications. Finally, we evaluated performance of the CCC v2 system by assessing: 1) the stability of the system between ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes using data which included both ICD-9 codes and ICD-10 codes; 2) the year-to-year stability before and after ICD-10 implementation; and 3) the proportions of patients classified as having a CCC in both the v1 and v2 systems.The CCC v2 classification system consists of diagnostic and procedural codes that incorporate a new neonatal CCC category as well as domains of complexity arising from technology dependence or organ transplantation. CCC v2 demonstrated close comparability between ICD-9 and ICD-10 and did not detect significant discontinuity in temporal trends of death in the United States. Compared to the original system, CCC v2 resulted in a 1.0\% absolute (10\% relative) increase in the number of patients identified as having a CCC in national hospitalization dataset, and a 0.4\% absolute (24\% relative) increase in a national emergency department dataset.The updated CCC v2 system is comprehensive and multidimensional, and provides a necessary update to accommodate widespread implementation of ICD-10.},

  Abstract                 = {Children with complex chronic conditions depend on both their families and systems of pediatric health care, social services, and financing. Investigations into the workings of this ecology of care would be advanced by more accurate methods of population-level predictions of the likelihood for future hospitalization.This was a retrospective cohort study. Hospital administrative data were collected from 38 children's hospitals in the United States for the years 2003-2005. Participants included patients between 2 and 18 years of age discharged from an index hospitalization during 2004. Patient characteristics documented during the index hospitalization or any previous hospitalization during the preceding 365 days were included. The main outcome measure was readmission to the hospital during the 365 days after discharge from the index admission.Among the cohort composed of 186856 patients discharged from the participating hospitals during 2004, the mean age was 9.2 years, with 54.4\% male and 52.9\% identified as non-Hispanic white. A total of 17.4\% were admitted during the previous 365 days, and among those discharged alive (0.6\% died during the admission), 16.7\% were readmitted during the ensuing 365 days. The final readmission model exhibited a c statistic of 0.81 across all hospitals, with a range from 0.76 to 0.84 for each hospital. Bootstrap-based assessments demonstrated the stability of the final model.Accurate population-level prediction of hospital readmissions is possible, and the resulting predicted probability of hospital readmission may prove useful for health services research and planning.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Little is known about factors that influence whether children with chronic conditions die at home. We sought to test whether deaths attributable to underlying complex chronic conditions (CCCs) were increasingly occurring at home and to determine what features were associated with home deaths. DESIGN: A retrospective case series was conducted of all deaths that occurred to children age 0 to 18 years in Washington state from 1980 to 1998 using death certificate data, augmented with 1990 US Census data regarding median household income by zip code in 1989, to determine the site of death. RESULTS: Of the 31 455 deaths identified in infants, children, and adults younger than 25 years, 52% occurred in the hospital, 17.2% occurred at home, 8.5% occurred in the emergency department or during transportation, 0.4% occurred in nursing homes, and 21.7% occurred at other sites. Among children who died as a result of some form of CCC (excluding injury, sudden infant death syndrome, and non-CCC medical conditions), the percentage of cases younger than 1 year who died at home rose slightly from 7.8% in 1980 to 11.6% in 1998, whereas the percentage of older children and young adults who had a CCC and died at home rose substantially from 21% in 1980 to 43% in 1998. Children who had lived in more affluent neighborhoods were more likely to have died at home. Using leukemia-related deaths as a benchmark, deaths as a result of congenital, genetic, neuromuscular, and metabolic conditions and other forms of cancer all were more likely to have occurred at home. Significant variation in the likelihood of home death, not explained by the individual attributes of the cases, also existed across the 39 counties in Washington state. CONCLUSIONS: Children who die with underlying CCCs increasingly do so at home. Age at death, specific condition, local area affluence, and the location of home all influence the likelihood of home death. These findings warrant additional study, as they have implications for how we envision pediatric palliative care, hospice, and other supportive services for the future.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) management are the current standards to guide care of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, brain hypoxia and secondary brain injury can occur despite optimal ICP and CPP. In this study, we used brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO(2)) monitoring to examine the association between multiple patient factors, including PbtO(2), and outcome in pediatric severe TBI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 52 children (less than 15 years) with severe TBI were managed with continuous PbtO(2) and ICP monitoring. The relationships between outcome [Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale] and clinical, radiologic, treatment, and physiological variables, including PbtO(2), were examined using multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Outcome was favorable in 40 patients (77%) and unfavorable (mortality, 9.6%; n = 5) in 12 (23%). In univariate analysis, the following variables had a significant association with unfavorable outcome: initial GCS, computed tomography classification, ICP(peak), mICP(24), mICP, CPP(low), CPP(<40), pupil reactivity, PbtO(2)(low), PbtO(2) < 5 mmHg, PbtO(2) < 10 mmHg, mPbtO(2)(24), and time-severity product. PbtO(2) parameters had the strongest independent association with poor outcome in multiple regression analysis. In particular, when PbtO(2) was <5 mmHg for >1 h, the adjusted OR for poor outcome was 27.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.9-391). No variables apart from PbtO(2) were independently associated with mortality when controlled for PbtO(2). CONCLUSION: Reduced PbtO(2) is shown to be an independent factor associated with poor outcome in pediatric severe TBI in the largest study to date. It appears to have a stronger association with outcome than conventionally evaluated measures.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: Brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO(2)) monitoring is used increasingly in adult severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) management. Several factors are known to influence PbtO(2) in adults, but the variables that affect PbtO(2) in pediatric TBI are not well described. This study examines the relationships between PbtO(2) and (1) physiological markers of potential secondary insults commonly used in pediatric TBI, in particular intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and systemic hypoxia, and (2) other clinical factors and treatment received that may influence PbtO(2). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 52 children (mean age, 6.5 +/- 3.4 years; range, 9 months to 14 years old) with severe TBI and a median post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 5 were managed with continuous PbtO(2) monitoring. The relationships between PbtO(2) parameters (Pbt)(2)(low), PbtO(2) < 5, PbtO(2) < 10, and mPbtAO(2)(24)) and clinical, physiological, and treatment factors were explored using time-linked data and Spearman's correlation coefficients. RESULTS: No clinical, physiological, or treatment variable was significantly associated with all PbtO(2) parameters, but individual associations were found with initial GCS (PbtO(2) < 5, p = 0.0113), admission Pediatric Trauma Score (PbtO(2) < 10, 0.0175), mICP > 20 (mPbtO(2)(24), p = 0.0377), CPP(low) (PbtO(2)(low), p = 0.0065), CPP < 40 (PbtO(2)(low), p = 0.0269; PbtO(2) < 5, p = 0.0212), P(a)O(2) < 60 (mPbtO(2)(24), p = 0.0037), S(a)O(2) < 90 (PbtO(2)(low), p = 0.0438), and use of inotropes during ICU care (PbtO(2)(low), p = 0.0276; PbtO(2) < 10, p = 0.0277; p = mPbtO(2)(24)). CONCLUSION: Delivery of oxygen to the brain is important to limit secondary neuronal injury after severe TBI. Our data show that PbtO(2) is poorly predicted by clinical and physiological factors commonly measured in the pediatric ICU. Multimodality monitoring may be needed to detect all secondary cerebral insults in pediatric TBI.},

  Abstract                 = {Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which has many genetic causes, is characterized by multi-system inflammation. HLH is a reactive process resulting from prolonged and excessive activation of antigen presenting cells (macrophages, histiocytes) and CD8(+) T cells. Hemophagocytosis, which is mediated through the CD163 heme-scavenging receptor, is a hallmark of activated macrophages/histiocytes and is the characteristic finding for which the disorder was named. The majority of genetic causes identified to date affect the cytotoxic function of NK and T cells, crippling immunologic mechanisms that mediate natural immune contraction. The predominant clinical findings of HLH are fevers (often hectic and persistent), cytopenias, hepatitis and splenomegaly. Due to the life-threatening implications of the diagnosis of genetically determined HLH, antiinflammatory therapy, often consisting of steroids, etoposide or antithymocyte globulin (ATG), should be instituted promptly, followed by curative hematopoietic cell transplantation. Secondary HLH, associated with autoimmune disorders or viral infections in teens and adults, also carries a significant mortality rate and should be managed in consultation with specialists familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of such disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the effects of prone positioning on airway management, mechanical ventilation, enteral nutrition, pain and sedation management, and staff utilization in infants and children with acute lung injury. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data collected in a multiple-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial of supine vs. prone positioning. SETTING: Seven pediatric intensive care units located in the United States. PATIENTS: One hundred and two pediatric patients (51 prone and 51 supine) with acute lung injury. INTERVENTIONS: Patients randomized to the supine group remained supine. Patients randomized to the prone group were positioned prone per protocol during the acute phase of their illness for a maximum of 7 days. Both groups were managed using ventilator and sedation protocols and nutrition and skin care guidelines. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Airway management and mechanical ventilatory variables before and after repositioning, enteral nutrition management, pain and sedation management, staff utilization, and adverse event data were collected for up to 28 days after enrollment. There were a total of 202 supine-prone-supine cycles. There were no differences in the incidence of endotracheal tube leak between the two groups (p = .30). Per protocol, 95% of patients remained connected to the ventilator during repositioning. The inadvertent extubation rate was 0.85 for the prone group and 1.03 for the supine group per 100 ventilator days (p = 1.00). There were no significant differences in the initiation of trophic (p = .24), advancing (p = .82), or full enteral feeds (p = .80) between the prone and supine groups; in the average pain (p = .81) and sedation (p = .18) scores during the acute phase; and in the amount of comfort medications received between the two groups (p = .91). There were no critical events during a turn procedure. While prone, two patients experienced an obstructed endotracheal tube. One patient, supported on high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, experienced persistent hypercapnea when prone and was withdrawn from the study. The occurrence of pressure ulcers was similar between the two groups (p = .71). Compared with the supine group, more staff (p </= .001) and more time were necessary to reposition patients in the prone group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that prone positioning can be safely performed in critically ill pediatric patients and that these patients can be safely managed while in the prone position for prolonged periods of time.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: It remains uncertain whether the choice of resuscitation fluid for patients in intensive care units (ICUs) affects survival. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial to compare the effect of fluid resuscitation with albumin or saline on mortality in a heterogeneous population of patients in the ICU. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients who had been admitted to the ICU to receive either 4 percent albumin or normal saline for intravascular-fluid resuscitation during the next 28 days. The primary outcome measure was death from any cause during the 28-day period after randomization. RESULTS: Of the 6997 patients who underwent randomization, 3497 were assigned to receive albumin and 3500 to receive saline; the two groups had similar baseline characteristics. There were 726 deaths in the albumin group, as compared with 729 deaths in the saline group (relative risk of death, 0.99; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.09; P=0.87). The proportion of patients with new single-organ and multiple-organ failure was similar in the two groups (P=0.85). There were no significant differences between the groups in the mean (+/-SD) numbers of days spent in the ICU (6.5+/-6.6 in the albumin group and 6.2+/-6.2 in the saline group, P=0.44), days spent in the hospital (15.3+/-9.6 and 15.6+/-9.6, respectively; P=0.30), days of mechanical ventilation (4.5+/-6.1 and 4.3+/-5.7, respectively; P=0.74), or days of renal-replacement therapy (0.5+/-2.3 and 0.4+/-2.0, respectively; P=0.41). CONCLUSIONS: In patients in the ICU, use of either 4 percent albumin or normal saline for fluid resuscitation results in similar outcomes at 28 days.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the use and feasibility of cold saline to decrease body temperature in pediatric neurocritical care. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Pediatric tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS: Children between 1 wk and 17 yrs of age admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with acute brain injury and having received intravenous cold saline between June and August 2009. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eighteen subjects accounted for 20 infusions with mean infusion volume 18 +/- 10 mL/kg. Eight subjects had traumatic brain injury, two had intracranial hemorrhage, six had cardiac arrest, and one each had ischemic stroke and status epilepticus. The mean age was 9.5 +/- 4.8 yrs. Temperature decreased from 38.7 +/- 1.1 degrees C to 37.7 +/- 1.2 degrees C and from 37.0 +/- 2.0 degrees C to 35.3 +/- 1.6 degrees C 1 hr after infusion for fever (n = 14; p < .05) or hypothermia induction (n = 6; p = .05), respectively. Cold saline was not bloused but rather infused over 10-15 mins. Mean arterial blood pressure and oxygenation parameters (PaO2/FIO2 ratio, mean airway pressure) were unchanged, but heart rate decreased in those with hypothermia (121 +/- 4 beats per minute vs. 109 +/- 12 beats per minute; p < .05). Serum sodium concentration and international normalized ratio were significantly increased after cold saline infusion. There were no differences between preinfusion and postinfusion serum glucose and hematocrit, or between cerebral perfusion pressure and intracranial pressure in traumatic brain injury patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cold saline was an effective method of reducing temperature in children with acute brain injury. This approach can be considered to treat fever or to induce hypothermia. A prospective study comparing safety and efficacy vs. other cooling measures should be considered.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The techniques used with laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB) and their association with patient outcomes remain largely unexplored. METHODS: We analyzed the data from the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative, which maintains a state-wide prospective clinical registry of bariatric surgery patients. Participating surgeons were surveyed regarding their use of specific techniques during LGB. The survey data were linked with the registry data from patients undergoing LGB from June 2006 to January 2010. The gastrojejunostomy technique and the use of staple-line reinforcement were evaluated for their effects on patient outcomes. RESULTS: During the study period, 9904 patients underwent LGB. A total of 44 surgeons (86%) completed the survey. When performing gastrojejunostomy, most surgeons used a circular stapler (CS) technique (66%), followed by the hand-sewn (HS) (18%) and linear stapler (LS) (16%). Also, 48% of surgeons reported using staple-line buttressing when creating the gastric pouch. The rate of anastomotic leak at the gastrojejunostomy was not affected by the surgical technique (CS .6%, LS .3%, HS .6%, P = .38). However, the CS technique was associated with a greater rate of postoperative hemorrhage (CS 2.9%, LS 1.2%, HS 1.6%, P <.0001) and wound infection (CS 4.7%, LS 1.6%, HS .6%, P <.0001). The use of staple-line reinforcement was associated with a lower rate of postoperative hemorrhage (1.9% versus 2.7%, P = .012). CONCLUSION: With LGB, the use of the CS technique was associated with greater rates of postoperative hemorrhage and wound infection than the use of the LS or HS technique. Furthermore, the use of staple-line reinforcement was associated with a reduction in the rates of postoperative hemorrhage.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES:: To develop a risk prediction model for serious complications after bariatric surgery. BACKGROUND:: Despite evidence for improved safety with bariatric surgery, serious complications remain a concern for patients, providers and payers. There is little population-level data on which risk factors can be used to identify patients at high risk for major morbidity. METHODS:: The Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative is a statewide consortium of hospitals and surgeons, which maintains an externally-audited prospective clinical registry. We analyzed data from 25,469 patients undergoing bariatric surgery between June 2006 and December 2010. Significant risk factors on univariable analysis were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model to identify factors associated with serious complications (life threatening and/or associated with lasting disability) within 30 days of surgery. Bootstrap resampling was performed to obtain bias-corrected confidence intervals and c-statistic. RESULTS:: Overall, 644 patients (2.5%) experienced a serious complication. Significant risk factors (P < 0.05) included: prior VTE (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, confidence interval [CI] 1.41-2.54); mobility limitations (OR 1.61, CI 1.23-2.13); coronary artery disease (OR 1.53, CI 1.17-2.02); age over 50 (OR 1.38, CI 1.18-1.61); pulmonary disease (OR 1.37, CI 1.15-1.64); male gender (OR 1.26, CI 1.06-1.50); smoking history (OR 1.20, CI 1.02-1.40); and procedure type (reference lap band): duodenal switch (OR 9.68, CI 6.05-15.49); laparoscopic gastric bypass (OR 3.58, CI 2.79-4.64); open gastric bypass (OR 3.51, CI 2.38-5.22); sleeve gastrectomy (OR 2.46, CI 1.73-3.50). The c-statistic was 0.68 (bias-corrected to 0.66) and the model was well-calibrated across deciles of predicted risk. CONCLUSIONS:: We have developed and validated a population-based risk scoring system for serious complications after bariatric surgery. We expect that this scoring system will improve the process of informed consent, facilitate the selection of procedures for high-risk patients, and allow for better risk stratification across studies of bariatric surgery.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: There were numerous efforts in the United States during the previous decade to concentrate selected surgical procedures in high-volume hospitals. It remains unknown whether referral patterns for high-risk surgery have changed as a result and how operative mortality has been affected. METHODS: We used national Medicare data to study patients undergoing one of eight different cancer and cardiovascular operations from 1999 through 2008. For each procedure, we examined trends in hospital volume and market concentration, defined as the proportion of Medicare patients undergoing surgery in the top decile of hospitals by volume per year. We used regression-based techniques to assess the effects of volume and market concentration on mortality over time, adjusting for case mix. RESULTS: Median hospital volumes of four cancer resections (lung, esophagus, pancreas, and bladder) and of repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rose substantially. Depending on the procedure, higher hospital volumes were attributable to an increasing number of cases nationwide, an increasing market concentration, or both. Hospital volumes rose slightly for aortic-valve replacement but fell for coronary-artery bypass grafting and carotid endarterectomy. Operative mortality declined for all eight procedures, ranging from a relative decline of 8% for carotid endarterectomy (1.3% mortality in 1999 and 1.2% in 2008) to 36% for AAA repair (4.4% in 1999 and 2.8% in 2008). Higher hospital volumes explained a large portion of the decline in mortality for pancreatectomy (67% of the decline), cystectomy (37%), and esophagectomy (32%), but not for the other procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Operative mortality with high-risk surgery fell substantially during the previous decade. Although increased market concentration and hospital volume have contributed to declining mortality with some high-risk cancer operations, declines in mortality with other procedures are largely attributable to other factors.

A total of 1469 subjects (1539 admissions) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of Arkansas Children's Hospital from July 1989 through December 1990. Patients were assigned baseline POPC and PCPC scores derived from historical information and discharge scores at the time of discharge from the hospital (or from the pediatric intensive care unit for patients with multiple hospitalizations). Delta scores were calculated as the difference between the discharge scores and the baseline scores. The changes in POPC and PCPC scores were associated with several measures of morbidity (length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit, total hospital charges, and discharge care needs) and with severity of illness (pediatric risk of mortality score) or severity of injury (pediatric trauma score) (p less than 0.0001). Interrater reliability was excellent (r = 0.88 to 0.96; p less than 0.001). The POPC and PCPC scales are apparently reliable and valid tools for assessing the outcome of pediatric intensive care.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Given the current focus on outcomes, there is a crucial need for easily utilized measures that can effectively quantify morbidity or disability after a child's critical illness or injury. The purpose of this study is to significantly extend the research on two such promising measures: the Pediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC) and the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC). DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a sample of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) discharges and a prospective follow-up of this cohort of children. SETTING: Arkansas Children's Hospital. PATIENTS: Two hundred children (ranging in age from birth to 21 yrs) discharged from a PICU. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were collected at PICU discharge, hospital discharge, and 1- and 6-month follow-up assessments after hospital discharge. Measures utilized included the POPC (at PICU discharge), PCPC (at PICU discharge), Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, fourth edition (at hospital discharge), Bayley Scales of Infant Development, second edition (at hospital discharge), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (at 1 and 6 months after discharge). Stanford-Binet Intelligence Quotients and Bayley Mental Developmental Index scores were significantly different across PCPC categories (p < .0001). Bayley Psychomotor Developmental Index scores and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales scores varied significantly across POPC categories (p < .0001). The test for linear trend was also significant for each of the comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study offer additional support for the use of the PCPC and POPC. These brief and easily completed measures can provide useful information regarding probable outcomes for pediatric intensive care patients when more extensive psychometric testing is not feasible or desirable.},

We describe 11 cases of clonidine ingestion by toddlers (mean dose 0.15 mg/kg; range 0.01 to 0.57). The source of the clonidine was a grand-parent in six of 11 cases. Symptoms included altered level of consciousness (n = 11), miosis (n = 5), bradycardia (n = 8), hypotension (n = 5), apnea and respiratory depression (n = 6), hypothermia (n = 5) and hypertension (n = 3). Therapeutic interventions included naloxone (n = 8) and atropine (n = 4), dopamine (n = 1), fluid resuscitation (n = 4), and endotracheal intubation (n = 1). There were no deaths. Symptoms of clonidine ingestion were typically mild if the dose ingested was less than 0.01 mg/kg, while bradycardia and hypotension occurred usually with doses of greater than 0.01 mg/kg. Apnea and respiratory depression were common when the dose exceeded 0.02 mg/kg. More effective measures are needed to prevent these potentially serious intoxications.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to establish relationships between illness severity, length of stay, and functional outcomes in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) by using multi-institutional data. We hypothesized that a positive relationship exists between functional outcome scores, severity of illness, and length of stay. DESIGN: The study used a prospective multicentered inception cohort design. SETTING: The study was conducted in 16 PICUs across the United States that were member institutions of the Pediatric Critical Care Study Group of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. PATIENTS: In total, 11,106 patients were assessed, representing all admissions to these intensive care units for 12 consecutive months. MEASUREMENTS: Functional outcomes were measured by the Pediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC) and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) scales. Both scales were assessed at baseline and discharge from the PICU. Delta scores were formed by subtracting baseline scores from discharge scores. Other measurements included admission Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores, age, operative status, length of stay in the PICU, and diagnoses. Interrater reliability was assessed by using a set of ten standardized cases on two occasions 6 months apart. MAIN RESULTS: Baseline, discharge, and delta POPC and PCPC outcome scores were associated with length of stay in the PICU and with predicted risk of mortality (p < .01). Incorporation of baseline functional status in multivariate length of stay analyses improved measured fit. Mild baseline cerebral deficits in children were associated with 18% longer PICU stays after controlling for other patient and institutional characteristics. Moderate and severe baseline deficits for both the POPC and PCPC score predict increased length of stay of between 30% and 40%. On the standardized cases, interrater consensus was achieved on 82% of scores with agreement to within one neighboring class for 99.7% of scores. CONCLUSIONS: These data establish current relationships for the POPC and PCPC outcome scales based on multi-institutional data. The reported relationships can be used as reference values for evaluating clinical programs or for clinical outcomes research.},

  Abstract                 = {Electrophiles generated endogenously, or via the metabolic bioactivation of drugs and other environmental chemicals, are capable of binding to a variety of nucleophilic sites within proteins. Factors that determine site selective susceptibility to electrophile-mediated post-translational modifications, and the consequences of such alterations, remain largely unknown. To identify and characterize chemical-mediated protein adducts, electrophiles with known toxicity were utilized. Hydroquinone, and its mercapturic acid pathway metabolites, cause renal proximal tubular cell necrosis and nephrocarcinogenicity in rats. The adverse effects of HQ and its thioether metabolites are in part a consequence of their oxidation to the corresponding electrophilic 1,4-benzoquinones (BQ). We now report that BQ and 2-(N-acetylcystein-S-yl)benzoquinone (NAC-BQ) preferentially bind to solvent-exposed lysine-rich regions within cytochrome c. Furthermore, we have identified specific glutamic acid residues within cytochrome c as novel sites of NAC-BQ adduction. The microenvironment at the site of adduction governs both the initial specificity and the structure of the final adduct. The solvent accessibility and local pKa of the adducted and neighboring amino acids contribute to the selectivity of adduction. Postadduction chemistry subsequently alters the nature of the final adduct. Using molecular modeling, the impact of BQ and NAC-BQ adduction on cytochrome c was visualized, revealing the spatial rearrangement of critical residues necessary for protein-protein interactions. Consequently, BQ-adducted cytochrome c fails to initiate caspase-3 activation in native lysates and also inhibits Apaf-1 oligomerization into an apoptosome complex in a purely reconstituted system. In summary, a combination of mass spectroscopic, molecular modeling, and biochemical approaches confirms that electrophile-protein adducts produce structural alterations that influence biological function.},

Initial mean ICP before 0.9% saline infusions equaled 19.3 mm Hg and averaged 20.0 mm Hg during the subsequent 2-h trials (p = 0.32). Baseline mean ICP before 3% saline administration equaled 19.9 mm Hg and averaged 15.8 mm Hg for 2 h postinfusion (p = 0.003). Central venous pressure did not change significantly in either group, nor did measurements of renal function. Serum sodium concentrations increased in all 18 trials of 3% saline. Maximal concentrations of serum sodium occurred 30 min after bolus administration of 3% saline. Three percent saline significantly reduces raised ICP after traumatic brain injury when compared with normal saline.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Annually, millions of children are exposed to anesthetic agents that cause apoptotic neurodegeneration in immature animals. To explore the possible significance of these findings in children, we investigated the association between exposure to anesthesia and subsequent (1) learning disabilities (LDs), (2) receipt of an individualized education program for an emotional/behavior disorder (IEP-EBD), and (3) scores of group-administered achievement tests. METHODS: This was a matched cohort study in which children (N = 8548) born between January 1, 1976, and December 31, 1982, in Rochester, Minnesota, were the source of cases and controls. Those exposed to anesthesia (n = 350) before the age of 2 were matched to unexposed controls (n = 700) on the basis of known risk factors for LDs. Multivariable analysis adjusted for the burden of illness, and outcomes including LDs, receipt of an IEP-EBD, and the results of group-administered tests of cognition and achievement were outcomes. RESULTS: Exposure to multiple, but not single, anesthetic/surgery significantly increased the risk of developing LDs (hazard ratio: 2.12 [95% confidence interval: 1.26-3.54]), even when accounting for health status. A similar pattern was observed for decrements in group-administered tests of achievement and cognition. However, exposure did not affect the rate of children receiving an individualized education program. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated exposure to anesthesia and surgery before the age of 2 was a significant independent risk factor for the later development of LDs but not the need for educational interventions related to emotion/behavior. We cannot exclude the possibility that multiple exposures to anesthesia/surgery at an early age may adversely affect human neurodevelopment with lasting consequence.},

The average age of the evaluated children was 8 years. MRI confirmed the plain radiography diagnosis in 66% of children and altered the diagnosis in 34%.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Assessment of injury severity is important in the management of patients with brain trauma. We aimed to analyze the usefulness of the head abbreviated injury score (AIS), the injury severity score (ISS), and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) as measures of injury severity and predictors of outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: Data were prospectively collected from 410 patients with TBI. AIS, ISS, and GCS were recorded at admission. Subjects' outcomes after TBI were measured using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) at 12 months postinjury. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Outcome information was obtained from 270 patients (66%). ISS was the best predictor of GOS-E (rs = -0.341, p < 0.001), followed by GCS score (rs = 0.227, p < 0.001), and head AIS (rs = -0.222, p < 0.001). When considered in combination, GCS score and ISS modestly improved the correlation with GOS-E (R = 0.335, p < 0.001). The combination of GCS score and head AIS had a similar effect (R = 0.275, p < 0.001). Correlations were stronger from patients <or=48 years old. We found comparable correlations between patients who suffered severe injuries (GCS <or=8) and those who suffered mild and moderate injuries (GCS >8). CONCLUSIONS: GCS score, AIS, and ISS are weakly correlated with 12-month outcome. However, anatomic measures modestly outperform GCS as predictors of GOS-E. The combination of GCS and AIS/ISS correlate with outcome better than do any of the three measures alone. Results support the addition of anatomic measures such as AIS and ISS in clinical studies of TBI. Additionally, most of the variance in outcome is not accounted for by currently available measures of injury severity.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart analysis of pediatric trauma patients with suspected cervical spine injury was performed. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and cost-efficiency of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol for cervical spine clearance in pediatric trauma patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The evaluation of cervical spine injury in the pediatric trauma population can be difficult. In obtunded or uncooperative children, MRI can be valuable in defining injuries of the cervical spine not detected by plain radiographs and computed tomography. METHODS: In 1993, a protocol was instituted at a pediatric trauma center using MRI to evaluate the cervical spine of children who could not be cleared within 72 hours. Using the trauma registry from February 1989 through September 1996, children with suspected cervical spine injury who were intubated at the time of hospital admission and who remained in the intensive care unit for at least 3 days were identified. The patients were divided into two cohorts: a "preprotocol group" and a "postprotocol group," consisting of patients before or after institution of the MRI protocol in September 1993. Medical records were reviewed to determine the time to cervical spine clearance, the number of days in the intensive care unit, and hospital days for each group. Biostatistical analysis was performed by an independent professional statistician. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients in each group met the inclusion criteria. In the preprotocol group, 19 patients underwent MRI at an average of 6.8 days after admission. In the postprotocol group, 31 MRIs were performed at an average of 2.5 days from admission. Time to cervical spine clearance decreased from 5.1 days in the preprotocol group to 3.2 days in the postprotocol group (P = 0.003). The average intensive care unit stay decreased from 9.2 days in the preprotocol group to 7.3 days in the postprotocol group (P = 0.122). The average hospital stay decreased from 20.1 days in the preprotocol group to 15.5 days in the postprotocol group (P = 0.106). Factoring charges for MRI, intensive care unit beds, and hospital beds, savings of $7,700 per patient were estimated. CONCLUSIONS: In obtunded and intubated pediatric trauma patients with suspected cervical spine injury, the clearance protocol using cervical spine MRI was effective and cost-efficient.},

  Abstract                 = {Lysophosphatidylcholine has been shown to enhance neutrophil functions through a mechanism involving the G protein-coupled receptor G2A. Recent data support an indirect effect of lysophosphatidylcholine on G2A rather than direct ligand binding. These observations prompted the hypothesis that other lysophospholipids (lyso-PLs) may also signal for human neutrophil activation through G2A. To this end, 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-L-choline], but also C18:1/OH lyso-PLs bearing the phosphoserine and phosphoethanolamine head groups, presented on albumin, were shown to signal for calcium flux in a self- and cross-desensitizing manner, implicating a single receptor. Blocking Abs to G2A inhibited calcium signaling by all three lyso-PLs. Furthermore, inhibition by both pertussis toxin and U-73122 established signaling via the Galphai/phospholipase C pathway for calcium mobilization. Altered plasma membrane localization of G2A has been hypothesized to facilitate signaling. Accordingly, an increase in detectable G2A was demonstrated by 1 min after lyso-PL stimulation and was followed by visible patching of the receptor. Western blotting showed that G2A resides in the plasma membrane/secretory vesicle fraction and not in neutrophil primary, secondary, or tertiary granules. Enhanced detection of G2A induced by lyso-PLs was paralleled by enhanced detection of CD45, confirming mobilization of the labile secretory vesicle pool. Together, these data show that lyso-PLs bearing various head groups redundantly mobilize G2A latent within secretory vesicles and result in G2A receptor/Galphai/phospholipase C signaling for calcium flux in neutrophils.},

  Abstract                 = {We aim to describe the demographics and clinical characteristics of children discharged to palliative care from 31 paediatric intensive care units in Great Britain, using a cohort of admissions and discharges from the database of paediatric intensive care units (Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet)). The patients included in this study were children discharged alive from paediatric intensive care units (n = 68882) between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008. The main outcome measure was Odds Ratios for discharge of children from paediatric intensive care units to palliative care and their referral destination. We found that palliative care status was recorded for 68,090 live discharges from paediatric intensive care units, with 492 (0.7%) discharges to palliative care, a proportion that varied by Strategic Health Authority (range 0 to 1.1). The odds of discharge to palliative care were increased by expected probability of death (log odds of mortality) associated with an oncology, neurology or respiratory diagnosis. South Asian children referred to palliative care were less likely to receive this care in a hospice (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04,0.83) and more likely to receive it in a hospital setting (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.16,5.71). We conclude that children admitted to paediatric intensive care units have a very low rate of discharge to palliative care. Specific demographic and clinical variables are associated with referral to palliative care.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine where children die following discharge from paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in Great Britain and to investigate if this varies by discharge to palliative care. DESIGN: National cohort of PICU admissions linked to Office of National Statistics death certificate data. SETTING: 31 PICUs in Great Britain. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 35 383 children admitted to PICUs between 1 November 2002 until 25 January 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Place of death by palliative care discharge status. RESULTS: 2346 (6.6%) deaths occurred after discharge during the study period, which is more than 10 times the normal child population mortality of 6.0 per 1000. Discharge to palliative care resulted in fewer deaths in hospital (44.1%) (compared to non-palliative care discharges (77.7%)), a greater proportion of deaths were at home (33.3% compared to non-palliative discharges 16.1%) and in a hospice (22.5% compared to non-palliative discharges 5.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Children referred to palliative care services at discharge from PICU are more likely to die in the community (home or hospice) than children not referred to palliative care.},

  Abstract                 = {Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, an accepted rescue therapy for refractory cardiopulmonary failure, requires a complex multidisciplinary approach and advanced technology. Little is known about the relationship between a center's case volume and patient mortality. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation annual volume and in-hospital mortality and assess if a minimum hospital volume could be recommended.Retrospective cohort study.A retrospective cohort admitted to children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System database from 2004 to 2011 supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was identified. Indications were assigned based on patient age (neonatal vs pediatric), diagnosis, and procedure codes. Average hospital annual volume was defined as 0-19, 20-49, or greater than or equal to 50 cases per year. Maximum likelihood estimates were used to assess minimum annual case volume.A total of 7,322 pediatric patients aged 0-18 were supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and had an indication assigned.None.Average hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation volume ranged from 1 to 58 cases per year. Overall mortality was 43\% but differed significantly by indication. After adjustment for case-mix, complexity of cardiac surgery, and year of treatment, patients treated at medium-volume centers (odds ratio, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.75-0.98) and high-volume centers (odds ratio, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.63-0.89) had significantly lower odds of death compared with those treated at low-volume centers. The minimum annual case load most significantly associated with lower mortality was 22 (95\% CI, 22-28).Pediatric centers with low extracorporeal membrane oxygenation average annual case volume had significantly higher mortality and a minimum volume of 22 cases per year was associated with improved mortality. We suggest that this threshold should be evaluated by additional study.},

We need to understand its frequency and its contribution to the total spectrum of the convulsive disorders.A review of selected articles dealing with epilepsy after brain trauma was undertaken.The number of epidemiologic studies of posttraumatic seizures has increased substantially over the past 40-50 years, offering steadily increasing knowledge of the frequency, natural history, and risk factors of this well-recognized complication of TBI. In general, the incidence of posttraumatic seizures varies with the time period after injury and population age range under study, as well as the spectrum of severity of the inciting injuries, and has been reported to be anywhere from 4 to 53\%. As high as 86\% of patients with one seizure after TBI will have a second in the next 2 years. Longer-term remission rates of 25-40\% have been reported. Significant risk factors for the development of seizures in the first week after injury include acute intracerebral hematoma (especially subdural hematoma), younger age, increased injury severity, and chronic alcoholism. Significant risk factors for the development of seizures >1 week after TBI include seizures within the first week, acute intra-cerebral hematoma (especially subdural hematoma), brain contusion, increased injury severity, and age >65 years at the time of injury.Epilepsy is a frequent consequence of brain injury in both civilian and military populations. We understand some factors associated with its development, but there remain many unanswered questions.},

  Abstract                 = {Several factors influence children's ability to report accurate information about their dietary intake. To date, one understudied area of dietary assessment research relates to children's ability to estimate portion sizes of food. The purpose of this cross-sectional research was to examine food portion size estimation accuracy in 7- to 18-year-old children with obesity. Two within-subject experiments (Experiment 1: n=28, Experiment 2: n=27) were conducted in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, during 2007-2008. Three types of portion size measurement aids (PSMAs) (eg, measuring cups and spoons, household objects [full and half-sized], and modeling clay) were counterbalanced in a Latin Square design for participants to estimate four types of foods (ie, solid, liquid, amorphous pieces, and amorphous masses). Analyses of variance conducted on percent of signed and absolute errors yielded significant PSMA typexfood type interactions (P<0.01) in both experiments. Across all food types, for Experiments 1 and 2, measuring cups and spoons produced the least accurate estimates with respect to absolute error (54.2% and 53.1%, respectively), whereas modeling clay produced the most accurate estimates (40.6% and 33.2%, respectively). Half sizes of household objects also yielded enhanced accuracy (47.9% to 37.2%). Finally, there were significant differences in accuracy between amorphous pieces (eg, grapes) vs amorphous masses (eg, mashed potatoes; P<0.01), indicating that there are qualitative differences in how different amorphous foods are estimated. These data are relevant when collecting food intake data from children with obesity and indicate that different PSMAs may be needed to optimize food portion size estimation accuracy for different food types.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The current study investigated individual growth in autonomy development across the adolescent transition, comparing the trajectories of children with and without spina bifida. METHOD: Individual growth curve modeling procedures were utilized to describe the developmental course of autonomy across four waves of data collection, from ages 9 to 15, and to test whether illness status [spina bifida vs. matched comparison group (N = 68 for both groups at Time 1)] would significantly predict individual variability in autonomy development. Potential moderators [child gender, SES, and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) score] of the association between illness status and autonomy development were also examined. RESULTS: Children with spina bifida demonstrated distinct developmental trajectories, though the nature of the group differences varied by type of autonomy development (emotional vs. behavioral), context (i.e. school vs. family), and reporter. Significant interactions with PPVT score and child gender were found. CONCLUSION: Overall, children with spina bifida show considerable developmental resiliency, but may lag behind their peers in specific areas of autonomy. Boys with spina bifida, and children with spina bifida who have lower than average levels of verbal intelligence, appear to be at greater risk for exhibiting delays in autonomy development.},

The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: This prospective cohort study examined the association between educational level and breast cancer incidence in Japan. METHOD: A baseline survey was conducted between 1988 and 1990 among 110,792 residents of 45 areas, aged 40-79 years. Data were restricted to 24 areas where incidence registry data were available, and to subjects which provided information on educational level (32,646). The subjects were assigned to three groups according to their level of education (<16, 16-18, 18<). During 13 years of follow-up (328,931 person-year), 169 cases of breast cancer were newly diagnosed. RESULTS: Women with a high level of education had an increased risk of breast cancer (HR = 1.93, 95 percent confidence interval (95% CI): 1.18, 3.16, in women with the highest educational level) compared with women with the lowest educational level. Adjustment for lifestyle and reproductive factors did not substantially change the results. In addition, when analyses were stratified by age subgroups, the educational difference in breast cancer incidence was more evident among the younger than the elder subgroup. CONCLUSION: The present results suggested that cancer prevention strategies should recognize women with a higher educational level as a high risk group for breast cancer.},

We collected data on the number of births by place from the Palestinian Ministry of Health and Holy Family Hospital (HFH) in Bethlehem and on Israeli army's invasions into Bethlehem. We then analysed these factors. We see the percentage of births in government hospitals increased after a new health insurance scheme was introduced in 2001. The number of births in HFH decreased during this period. Israeli army invasions also contributed to the decrease of births in HFH during April 2002. However, reducing the charge for delivery at HFH in December 2002 greatly increased the number of births there. We concluded that, in urban Bethlehem, although movement restrictions contributed to the change in the place of birth, economic support programmes have also contributed to offsetting the movement restriction effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Doubly robust estimation combines a form of outcome regression with a model for the exposure (i.e., the propensity score) to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. When used individually to estimate a causal effect, both outcome regression and propensity score methods are unbiased only if the statistical model is correctly specified. The doubly robust estimator combines these 2 approaches such that only 1 of the 2 models need be correctly specified to obtain an unbiased effect estimator. In this introduction to doubly robust estimators, the authors present a conceptual overview of doubly robust estimation, a simple worked example, results from a simulation study examining performance of estimated and bootstrapped standard errors, and a discussion of the potential advantages and limitations of this method. The supplementary material for this paper, which is posted on the Journal's Web site (http://aje.oupjournals.org/), includes a demonstration of the doubly robust property (Web Appendix 1) and a description of a SAS macro (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) for doubly robust estimation, available for download at http://www.unc.edu/~mfunk/dr/.},

METHODS: We examined the correlations of age, sex, smoking, oral hygiene score, blood pressure, body mass index, and blood chemical data with the mean depth of periodontal pockets or the number of remaining teeth. PATIENTS: One hundred outpatients with type 2 diabetes aged 29 to 77 years. RESULTS: The mean depth of periodontal pockets was significantly associated with smoking, oral hygiene score, and HbA1c; the Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were 0.220, 0.417, and 0.260, respectively. Age, oral hygiene score, and HbA1c were inversely correlated with the number of remaining teeth (r=-0.306, -0.287, and -0.275, respectively). Serum total cholesterol was significantly correlated with the mean depth of pockets after adjustment for smoking, oral hygiene score, and HbA1c (r=0.211; P=0.044), while serum HDL cholesterol tended to be negatively associated with depth (r=-0.202; P=0.055). Serum HDL cholesterol was also associated with an increased number of teeth, which remained significant after adjustment for age, oral hygiene score, and HbA1c (r=0.202; P=0.048). The estimated glomerular filtration rate was significantly and positively correlated with the number of teeth in the univariate analysis, although consideration of the potential confounding factors somewhat weakened the association (r=0.186; P=0.069).

Urban cases resided in counties designated by the U.S. Census Bureau as metropolitan statistical areas (MSA). Rural cases were divided into two groups: "rural, nonremote," if the country of residence was adjacent to an MSA county or if it had a population of 2500, and "rural, remote," if not.Average annual age-adjusted rates of hospitalized and fatal traumatic brain injury varied significantly from 97.8 per 100,000 population for the most urban group to 172.1 per 100,000 population for the residents of rural, remote counties. Similarly, total mortality ranged from 18.1 per 100,000 population among residents of the most urban counties to 33.8 among residents of rural, remote counties. Prehospital mortality ranged from 10.0 to 27.7 traumatic brain injuries per 100,000 population.These results provide justification for expanding efforts to prevent traumatic brain injury to include the small, but high-risk group of residents in rural areas.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: In 1992, the first consensus definition of severe sepsis was published. Subsequent epidemiologic estimates were collected using administrative data, but ongoing discrepancies in the definition of severe sepsis produced large differences in estimates. OBJECTIVES: We seek to describe the variations in incidence and mortality of severe sepsis in the United States using four methods of database abstraction. We hypothesized that different methodologies of capturing cases of severe sepsis would result in disparate estimates of incidence and mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Using a nationally representative sample, four previously published methods (Angus et al, Martin et al, Dombrovskiy et al, and Wang et al) were used to gather cases of severe sepsis over a 6-year period (2004-2009). In addition, the use of new International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition (ICD-9), sepsis codes was compared with previous methods. MEASUREMENTS: Annual national incidence and in-hospital mortality of severe sepsis. RESULTS: The average annual incidence varied by as much as 3.5-fold depending on method used and ranged from 894,013 (300/100,000 population) to 3,110,630 (1,031/100,000) using the methods of Dombrovskiy et al and Wang et al, respectively. Average annual increase in the incidence of severe sepsis was similar (13.0% to 13.3%) across all methods. In-hospital mortality ranged from 14.7% to 29.9% using abstraction methods of Wang et al and Dombrovskiy et al. Using all methods, there was a decrease in in-hospital mortality across the 6-year period (35.2% to 25.6% [Dombrovskiy et al] and 17.8% to 12.1% [Wang et al]). Use of ICD-9 sepsis codes more than doubled over the 6-year period (158,722 - 489,632 [995.92 severe sepsis], 131,719 - 303,615 [785.52 septic shock]). CONCLUSION: There is substantial variability in incidence and mortality of severe sepsis depending on the method of database abstraction used. A uniform, consistent method is needed for use in national registries to facilitate accurate assessment of clinical interventions and outcome comparisons between hospitals and regions.},

PURPOSE: To test a 16-week group-based weight reduction intervention combining exercise, diet and behaviour change strategies aimed to increase self-efficacy (Healthy Eating and Exercise Lifestyle Program-HEELP) on weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and exercise. METHODS: Participants with CHD and/or T2DM and BMI between 27 to 39 kg/m(2) were randomised to HEELP (n = 83) or usual care (n = 65). RESULTS: Participants were aged a mean 63.47 years (SD 8.9), male (58 %) and Caucasian (79 %). HEELP participants lost significantly more weight, BMI and waist circumference and exercised more days/week for a longer duration/week than usual care. Clinically significant weight loss (>/=5 %) was more common in HEELP than usual care. CONCLUSION: The HEELP resulted in weight loss and improved exercise behaviour in obese people with CHD and T2DM.},

  Abstract                 = {AIM: To evaluate serum ferritin level in children with severe sepsis and septic shock and its association with mortality. METHOD: A cohort study of 36 children aged 1 month-16 years with severe sepsis or septic shock requiring intensive care was conducted. Serum ferritin levels were measured at the time of diagnosis of sepsis and a ferritin index (FI=observed serum ferritin divided by the upper limit of normal ferritin for age and gender) was calculated. RESULTS: The median age (range) of the children was 6 (2-100) months. Ferritin was <200 ng/mL in 13 children, 200-500 ng/mL in 11 children and >500 ng/mL in 12 children. The mortality associated with these groups was 23%, 9% and 58%, respectively. A ferritin>500 ng/mL was associated with a 3.2 (1.3-7.9) relative risk of death (p=0.01). FI of 1.7 was the best cutoff value for identifying those who died. In a logistic regression analysis, ferritin level and PRISM were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Ferritin is raised in children with septic shock and high ferritin level is associated with poorer outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {The mainstay of asthma therapy, glucocorticosteroids (GCs) have among their therapeutic effects the inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production and induction of eosinophil apoptosis. In the absence of prosurvival cytokines (e.g., GM-CSF), eosinophils appear to be short-lived, undergoing apoptosis over 96 h in vitro. In a dose-dependent manner, GC further enhances apoptosis, while prosurvival cytokines inhibit apoptosis and antagonize the effect of GC. The mechanisms of eosinophil apoptosis, its enhancement by GC, and antagonism of GC by GM-CSF are not well-understood. As demonstrated in this study, baseline apoptosis of eosinophils resulted from oxidant-mediated mitochondrial injury that was significantly enhanced by GC. Mitochondrial injury was detected by early and progressive loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the antioxidant protein, Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD). Also observed was the activation/translocation of the proapoptotic protein, Bax, to mitochondria. Underscoring the role of oxidants was the inhibition of mitochondrial changes and apoptosis with culture in hypoxia, or pretreatment with a flavoprotein inhibitor or a SOD mimic. GCs demonstrated early (40 min) and late (16 h) activation of proapoptotic c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and decreased the antiapoptotic protein X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, a recently demonstrated inhibitor of JNK activation. Similarly, inhibition of JNK prevented GC-enhanced mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. Importantly, GM-CSF prevented GC-induced loss of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, late activation of JNK, and mitochondrial injury even in the face of unchanged oxidant production, loss of MnSOD, and early JNK activation. These data demonstrate that oxidant-induced mitochondrial injury is pivotal in eosinophil apoptosis, and is enhanced by GC-induced prolonged JNK activation that is in turn inhibited by GM-CSF.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To describe the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of inhaled tobramycin (TOBI; Chiron Corporation; Seattle, WA), 300-mg dose, delivered by a nebulizer (PARI LC Plus; Pari Respiratory; Richmond, VA) and a compressor (Pulmo-Aide, model 5650D; DeVilbiss Health Care; Somerset, PA) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients during the pivotal phase III trials. DESIGN: Data from two identical, 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies. SETTING: US sites randomized 258 patients with CF to receive tobramycin, 300 mg twice daily, in three 28-day on/28-day off treatment cycles. MEASUREMENT: Tobramycin sputum concentrations were assessed 10 min after the first and last doses were administered in the 20-week study. Serum tobramycin concentrations were assessed before and 1 h after the first and last doses had been administered. The population estimate of the apparent clearance was used to estimate the bioavailability fraction. RESULTS: The mean peak sputum concentration was 1,237 microg/g. About 95% of patients achieved sputum concentrations > 25 times the minimum inhibitory concentration of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. One hour after the dose, the mean serum concentration was 0.95 microg/mL. Tobramycin did not accumulate in the sputum or serum over the course of the study. Pharmacokinetic data were best represented by a two-compartment model with biexponential decay and slope estimates comparable to those following parenteral administration. The estimated systemic bioavailability after aerosol administration was 11.7% of the nominal dose. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of tobramycin, 300 mg bid, in a 28-day off/28-day on regimen produced low serum tobramycin concentrations, reducing the potential for systemic toxicity. High sputum concentrations ensure efficacious antibiotic levels at the site of the infection. Inhaled tobramycin significantly improved the therapeutic ratio over that of parenteral aminoglycosides.},

  Abstract                 = {Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury of the basal ganglia is a significant cause of disability in premature infants. Prolonged, moderate cerebral hypothermia has been shown to be neuroprotective after experimental hypoxia-ischemia; however, it has not been tested in the preterm brain. We therefore examined the effects of severe hypoxia and the potential neuroprotective effects of delayed hypothermia on phenotypic striatal neurons. Preterm (0.7 gestation) fetal sheep received complete umbilical cord occlusion for 25 min followed by cerebral hypothermia (fetal extradural temperature reduced from 39.4+/-0.3 degrees C to 29.5+/-2.6 degrees C) from 90 min to 70 h after the end of occlusion. Hypothermia was associated with a significant overall reduction in striatal neuronal loss compared with normothermia-occlusion fetuses (mean+/-SEM, 5.5+/-1.2% vs. 38.1+/-6.5%, P<0.01). Immunohistochemical studies showed that occlusion resulted in a significant loss of calbindin-28 kd, glutamic acid decarboxylase isoform 67 and neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunopositive neurons (n=7, P<0.05), but not choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons, compared with sham controls (n=7). Hypothermia (n=7) significantly reduced the loss of calbindin-28 kd and neuronal nitric oxide synthase, but not glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunopositive neurons. In conclusion, delayed, prolonged moderate head cooling was associated with selective protection of particular phenotypic striatal projection neurons after severe hypoxia in the preterm fetus. These findings suggest that head cooling may help reduce basal ganglia injury in some premature babies.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by notable phenotypic heterogeneity, which is often viewed as an obstacle to the study of its etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. On the basis of empirical evidence, instead of three binary categories, the upcoming edition of the DSM 5 will use two dimensions - social communication deficits (SCD) and fixated interests and repetitive behaviors (FIRB) - for the ASD diagnostic criteria. Building on this proposed DSM 5 model, it would be useful to consider whether empirical data on the SCD and FIRB dimensions can be used within the novel methodological framework of Factor Mixture Modeling (FMM) to stratify children with ASD into more homogeneous subgroups. Methods: The study sample consisted of 391 newly diagnosed children (mean age 38.3 months; 330 males) with ASD. To derive subgroups, data from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised indexing SCD and FIRB were used in FMM; FMM allows the examination of continuous dimensions and latent classes (i.e., categories) using both factor analysis (FA) and latent class analysis (LCA) as part of a single analytic framework. Results: Competing LCA, FA, and FMM models were fit to the data. On the basis of a set of goodness-of-fit criteria, a 'two-factor/three-class' factor mixture model provided the overall best fit to the data. This model describes ASD using three subgroups/classes (Class 1: 34%, Class 2: 10%, Class 3: 56% of the sample) based on differential severity gradients on the SCD and FIRB symptom dimensions. In addition to having different symptom severity levels, children from these subgroups were diagnosed at different ages and were functioning at different adaptive, language, and cognitive levels. Conclusions: Study findings suggest that the two symptom dimensions of SCD and FIRB proposed for the DSM 5 can be used in FMM to stratify children with ASD empirically into three relatively homogeneous subgroups.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Variation in medical practice has identified opportunities for quality improvement in patient care. The degree of variation in the use of antibiotics in children's hospitals is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 556,692 consecutive pediatric inpatient discharges from 40 freestanding children's hospitals between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2008. We used the Pediatric Health Information System to acquire data on antibiotic use and clinical diagnoses. RESULTS: Overall, 60% of the children received at least 1 antibiotic agent during their hospitalization, including >90% of patients who had surgery, underwent central venous catheter placement, had prolonged ventilation, or remained in the hospital for >14 days. Even after adjustment for both hospital- and patient-level demographic and clinical characteristics, antibiotic use varied substantially across hospitals, including both the proportion of children exposed to antibiotics (38%-72%) and the number of days children received antibiotics (368-601 antibiotic-days per 1000 patient-days). In general, hospitals that used more antibiotics also used a higher proportion of broad-spectrum antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Children's hospitals vary substantially in their use of antibiotics to a degree unexplained by patient- or hospital-level factors typically associated with the need for antibiotic therapy, which reveals an opportunity to improve the use of these drugs.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Intensive care unit beds are limited, yet few guidelines exist for triage of patients to the intensive care unit, especially patients at low risk for mortality. The frequency with which low-risk patients are admitted to intensive care units in different hospitals is unknown. Our objective was to assess variation in the use of intensive care for patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, a common condition with a low risk of mortality. DESIGN: Observational study using the New York State In-patient Database (2005-2007). SETTING: One hundred fifty-nine New York State acute care hospitals. PATIENTS: Fifteen thousand nine hundred ninety-four adult (>/= 18) hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 250.1x). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We calculated reliability- and risk-adjusted intensive care unit utilization, hospital length of stay, and mortality. We identified hospital-level factors associated with increased likelihood of intensive care unit admission after controlling patient characteristics using multilevel, mixed-effects logistic regression analyses; we assessed the amount of residual variation in intensive care unit utilization using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Use of intensive care for diabetic ketoacidosis patients varied widely across hospitals (adjusted range: 2.1% to 87.7%), but was not associated with hospital length of stay or mortality. After multilevel adjustment, hospitals with a high volume of diabetic ketoacidosis admissions admitted diabetic ketoacidosis patients to the intensive care unit less often (odds ratio 0.40, p = .002, highest quintile compared to lowest), whereas hospitals with higher rates of intensive care unit utilization for all nondiabetic ketoacidosis in-patients admitted diabetic ketoacidosis patients to the intensive care unit more frequently (odds ratio 1.31, p = .001, for each additional 10% increase). In the multilevel model, more than half (58%) of the variation in the intensive care unit admission practice attributable to hospitals remained unexplained. CONCLUSIONS: We observed variations across hospitals in the use of intensive care for diabetic ketoacidosis patients that was not associated with differences in-hospital length of stay or mortality. Institutional practice patterns appear to impact admission decisions and represent a potential target for reduction of resource utilization in higher use institutions.},

Before the patient reaches hospital, an organised trauma system that allows rapid resuscitation and transport directly to an experienced trauma centre significantly lowers mortality and morbidity. Only the education of medical personnel and the institution of trauma hospital systems can achieve further improvements in outcome for patients with traumatic brain injuries.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences in sepsis mortality between prepubertal and postpubertal males and females. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective review of the Virtual PICU Systems (VPS) database (including 74 pediatric intensive care units [PICUs]) for 2006-2008. We included prepubertal (aged 2-7 years) and postpubertal (aged 16-21 years) children with a primary diagnosis of sepsis admitted to a participating PICU. RESULTS: Prepubertal females (n = 272; 9.9% mortality) and prepubertal males (n = 303; 10.9% mortality) had similar mortality and severity of illness (Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 risk of mortality [PIM 2 ROM]). Postpubertal females (n = 233; mortality, 5.6%) had lower mortality than postpubertal males (n = 212; mortality, 11.8%; P = .03). PIM 2 ROM was higher for postpubertal males than postpubertal females (P = .02). After controlling for hospital specific effects with multivariate modeling, in postpubertal children, female gender was independently associated with a lower initial severity of illness (PIM 2 ROM: OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.96; P = .02). CONCLUSION: Sepsis mortality is similar in prepubertal males and females. However, postpubertal males have a higher sepsis mortality than postpubertal females, likely related to their greater severity of illness on PICU admission. These outcome differences in postpubertal children may reflect a hormonal influence on the response to infection or differences in underlying comorbidities, source of infection, or behavior.},

Ninety-eight subjects were to be randomized; however, the trial was stopped early because of evidence of a significant microbiological treatment effect. Twenty-one children under age 6 years were randomized (8 active; 13 placebo) and underwent bronchoalveolar lavage at baseline and on Day 28. There was a significant difference between treatment groups in the reduction in Pa density; no Pa was detected on Day 28 in 8 of 8 active group patients compared with 1 of 13 placebo group patients. We observed no differences between treatment groups for clinical indices, markers of inflammation, or incidence of adverse events. No abnormalities in serum creatinine or audiometry and no episodes of significant bronchospasm were observed in association with active treatment. We conclude that 28 days of tobramycin solution for inhalation of 300 mg twice daily is safe and effective for significant reduction of lower airway Pa density in young children with cystic fibrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies based on cell-free systems and on in vitro-cultured living cells support the concept that many cellular processes, such as transcription initiation, are highly dynamic: individual proteins stochastically bind to their substrates and disassemble after reaction completion. This dynamic nature allows quick adaptation of transcription to changing conditions. However, it is unknown to what extent this dynamic transcription organization holds for postmitotic cells embedded in mammalian tissue. To allow analysis of transcription initiation dynamics directly into living mammalian tissues, we created a knock-in mouse model expressing fluorescently tagged TFIIH. Surprisingly and in contrast to what has been observed in cultured and proliferating cells, postmitotic murine cells embedded in their tissue exhibit a strong and long-lasting transcription-dependent immobilization of TFIIH. This immobilization is both differentiation driven and development dependent. Furthermore, although very statically bound, TFIIH can be remobilized to respond to new transcriptional needs. This divergent spatiotemporal transcriptional organization in different cells of the soma revisits the generally accepted highly dynamic concept of the kinetic framework of transcription and shows how basic processes, such as transcription, can be organized in a fundamentally different fashion in intact organisms as previously deduced from in vitro studies.},

  Abstract                 = {The locational and orientational structure and the dynamics of cholesterol in the bilayer membrane were studied by using the solution-state NMR. The intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) was analyzed for large unilamellar vesicles (100 nm in diameter) composed of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and cholesterol at cholesterol concentrations of 9-33 mol %. The DMPC headgroups show (1)H-{(1)H}-NOEs with the methyl groups at the hydrophobic terminals of both cholesterol and DMPC, illustrating the significant fluctuation of the bilayer membrane in the vertical (bilayer normal) direction. Cholesterol was found to keep the hydroxyl (OH) group toward the outer water pool on the basis of the following observations: (1) the cross correlation between the DMPC headgroup and the cholesterol terminal methyl group is weaker than those between the DMPC headgroups and (2) the methyl group at the hydrophobic terminal of cholesterol shows strong correlation with the terminal group of the DMPC chain portion. The OH group plays a crucial role in orienting cholesterol with its OH group outward, since cholestane, which has a molecular structure similar to that of cholesterol except for the absence of the OH group, was found to have no orientational preference in the bilayer membrane. The dynamic slowdown at high cholesterol concentrations is demonstrated on the basis of the correlation times for NOE as well as the broadening of the proton linewidths.},

METHODS: A concurrent retrospective chart review of all cervical spine injuries treated at TCHA between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 1994 was performed. Data collected included patient demographics, date and time of injury, mechanism and site of injury, presence of associated injuries, clinical management, and outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with cervical spine injuries were seen at TCHA in the 36-month study period. The leading mechanism of injury was motor vehicle crashes (23/34 or 68%). Head injuries were associated with cervical spine injury in 53% of patients. Of the 20 patients aged 8 years or less, 10 (50%) had "low" cervical spine injuries (below C4). Overall mortality was 41% (14/34). Of the 15 vehicle occupants, 12 were unrestrained or inappropriately restrained. Two of those appropriately restrained were young school-aged children in lap-shoulder belts who sustained isolated cervical spine injuries. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The number of pediatric cervical spine injuries in our institution appears to be increasing. 2. Cervical spine injury in children less than 8 years of age are not exclusively confined to the region above C4. 3. Occurrence of cervical spine injuries despite lap-shoulder belt use suggests that efforts should be focused on refinement of motor vehicle restraint devices in young school-aged children.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Utah state trauma audit filters assess expeditious care at referring emergency departments for severely injured patients to avoid delays in transfer. We evaluated two state performance measures related to pediatric trauma care before arrival at the Level I trauma center. METHODS: Analysis of the Primary Children's Medical Center (PCMC) trauma database for children with Injury Severity Scores (ISS)>15 from 2006 to 2009 was performed. Patient care was evaluated for referring hospital emergency department triage time of <2 hours and total transfer time of </=6 hours for rural and </=4 hours for urban place of injury. RESULTS: Four hundred twelve patients with ISS>15 were admitted via interhospital transfer from within Utah. Approximately 50% of patients were triaged<2 hours, which increased to almost two thirds when restricted to those initially evaluated within 100 miles (helicopter range) of PCMC. Factors associated with delayed triaged included lower ISS, less severe head injury, greater distance from the trauma center, and primary chest/abdominal injuries. Death and poor outcome did not differ significantly by triage in <2 hours or >/=2 hours. Adherence with the total transfer time goal was 94% for rural and 76% for urban place of injury. CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial nonadherence with trauma performance measures for triage in <2 hours among pediatric trauma patients with ISS >15. Because of low rates of poor outcome, we are unable to determine whether adherence with state triage goals lessens morbidity or mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) was developed as a convenience sample of registry data from contributing trauma centers (TCs), thus, inferences about trauma patients may not be valid at the national level. The NTDB National Sample was created to obtain nationally representative estimates of trauma patients treated in the US level I and II TCs. METHODS: Level I and II TCs in the Trauma Information Exchange Program were identified and a random stratified sample of 100 TCs was selected. The probability-proportional-to-size method was used to select TCs and sample weights were calculated. National Sample Program estimates from 2003 to 2006 were compared with raw NTDB data, and to a subset of TCs in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a population-based dataset drawn from community hospitals. RESULTS: Weighted estimates from the NTDB National Sample range from 484,000 (2004) to 608,000 (2006) trauma incidents. Crude NTDB data over-represented the proportion of younger patients (0 years-14 years) compared with the NTDB National Sample, which does not include children's hospitals. Few TCs in Trauma Information Exchange Program are included in Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample, but estimates based on this subset indicate a higher percentage of older patients (age 65 year or older, 23.98% versus 17.85%), lower percentage male patients, and a lower percentage of motor vehicle accidents compared with NTDB National Sample. CONCLUSION: Although nationally representative data regarding trauma patients are available in other population-based samples, they do not represent TCs patients and lack the specificity of National Sample Program data, which contains detailed information on injury mechanisms, diagnoses, and hospital treatment.},

The PPR logic determines whether the reason for readmission is clinically related to a prior admission, and therefore potentially preventable. The likelihood of a PPR was found to be dependent on severity of illness, extremes of age, and the presence of mental health diagnoses. Analyses using PPRs show that readmission rates increase with increasing severity of illness and increasing time between admission and readmission, vary by the type of prior admission, and are stable within hospitals over time.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The presence of effusion/empyema in pediatric pneumonia can increase treatment complexity by possibly requiring pleural drainage. Currently, no data support the superiority of any drainage modalities in children. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information System database from 2003 to 2008. RESULTS: A total of 14,936 children were hospitalized with effusion/empyema. Fifty-two percent of children were treated with antibiotics alone. Compared with patients receiving a chest tube, patients receiving antibiotics alone, thoracotomy, and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery had a shorter length of stay, lower mortality rates, and fewer re-interventions. Delaying drainage by 1 to 3 days was associated with a lower mortality rate, and a delay of more than 7 days was associated with a higher mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Half of all children with effusion/empyema are treated with antibiotics alone with low morbidity and mortality. Initial video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or thoracotomy had improved outcomes compared with other interventions. Intervention should not be delayed beyond 7 days.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare the use of triple therapy versus monotherapy for children and adolescents with perforated appendicitis and to determine whether there has been a transition to monotherapy within the freestanding children's hospitals that contribute to the Pediatric Health Information System database. METHODS: We used the Pediatric Health Information System database, which includes billing and discharge data for 32 children's hospitals in the United States, to examine the trend in antibiotic usage and whether the postappendectomy antibiotic regimen was associated with differences in complication-related readmissions, length of stay, or charges in a population of children and adolescents with ruptured appendicitis and discharge dates between March 1, 1999, and September 30, 2004. Pairwise regression analyses were performed to compare the most common monotherapy regimens with the triple therapy. RESULTS: A total of 8545 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 58%, over the entire study period, received the aminoglycoside-based triple antibiotic therapy on postoperative day 1. There was, however, a notable transition over this 6-year period, from 69% to 52% of surgeons using aminoglycoside-based combination therapy. There were no significant differences in the odds of readmission at 30 days except for the group receiving ceftriaxone, which was associated with significantly decreased odds. The subgroup receiving piperacillin/tazobactam monotherapy demonstrated significantly decreased length of stay (-0.90 days) and total hospital charges, and the group receiving cefoxitin demonstrated significantly decreased length of stay (-1.89 days), as well as decreased pharmacy and total hospital charges. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent antibiotic therapy in the treatment of perforated appendicitis is being used with increasing frequency, is at least equal in efficacy to the traditional aminoglycoside-based combination therapy, and may offer improvements in terms of length of stay, pharmacy charges, and hospital charges.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Although general definitions of the sepsis continuum have been published for adults, no such work has been done for the pediatric population. Physiologic and laboratory variables used to define the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and organ dysfunction require modification for the developmental stages of children. An international panel of 20 experts in sepsis and clinical research from five countries (Canada, France, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States) was convened to modify the published adult consensus definitions of infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction for children. DESIGN: Consensus conference. METHODS: This document describes the issues surrounding consensus on four major questions addressed at the meeting: a) How should the pediatric age groups affected by sepsis be delineated? b) What are the specific definitions of pediatric SIRS, infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock? c) What are the specific definitions of pediatric organ failure and the validity of pediatric organ failure scores? d) What are the appropriate study populations and study end points required to successfully conduct clinical trials in pediatric sepsis? Five subgroups first met separately and then together to evaluate the following areas: signs and symptoms of sepsis, cell markers, cytokines, microbiological data, and coagulation variables. All conference participants approved the final draft of the proceedings of the meeting. RESULTS: Conference attendees modified the current criteria used to define SIRS and sepsis in adults to incorporate pediatric physiologic variables appropriate for the following subcategories of children: newborn, neonate, infant, child, and adolescent. In addition, the SIRS definition was modified so that either criteria for fever or white blood count had to be met. We also defined various organ dysfunction categories, severe sepsis, and septic shock specifically for children. Although no firm conclusion was made regarding a single appropriate study end point, a novel nonmortality end point, organ failure-free days, was considered optimal for pediatric clinical trials given the relatively low incidence of mortality in pediatric sepsis compared with adult populations. CONCLUSION: We modified the adult SIRS criteria for children. In addition, we revised definitions of severe sepsis and septic shock for the pediatric population. Our goal is for these first-generation pediatric definitions and criteria to facilitate the performance of successful clinical studies in children with sepsis.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the rate of increase of the population of adults seeking care as inpatients in children's hospitals over time. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2008, from patients hospitalized at 30 academic children's hospitals, including growth rates according to age group (pediatric: aged <18 years; transitional: aged 18-21 years; or adult: aged >21 years) and disease. RESULTS: There were 3 343 194 hospital discharges for 2 143 696 patients. Transitional patients represented 2.0%, and adults represented 0.8%, totaling 59 974 patients older than 18 years. The number of unique patients, admissions, patient-days, and charges increased in all age groups over the study period and are projected to continue to increase. Resource use was disproportionately higher in the older ages. The growth of transitional patients exceeded that of others, with 6.9% average annual increase in discharges, 7.6% in patient-days, and 15% in charges. Chronic conditions occurred in 87% of adults compared with 48% of pediatric patients. Compared with pediatric patients, the rates of increase of inpatient-days increased significantly for transitional age patients with cystic fibrosis, malignant neoplasms, and epilepsy, and for adults with cerebral palsy. Annual growth rates of charges increased for transitional and adult patients for all diagnoses except cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. CONCLUSIONS: The population of adults with diseases originating in childhood who are hospitalized at children's hospitals is increasing, with varying disease-specific changes over time. Our findings underscore the need for proactive identification of strategies to care for adult survivors of pediatric diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Until recently, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was a diagnosis reserved for children and adolescents as it was believed to dissipate before adulthood. New evidence, however, supports the persistence of ADHD beyond adolescence, and it is now recognized as a chronic neurobehavioral disorder in adults. Adults with ADHD have difficulties with school, work, family interactions, and social activities. Although treatments are available for adult ADHD, many patients never receive an accurate diagnosis that would afford them appropriate therapeutic intervention. If left untreated, adult ADHD can cause significant personal, social, and economic burdens that can have a negative impact on overall quality of life. This article discusses how ADHD presents in adults and the effects of the disorder on educational, occupational, interpersonal, and social functioning. Currently available treatments for ADHD in adults are also reviewed.},

METHODS: 10-week interim analysis of the Quality of life, Effectiveness, Safety, and Tolerability (QU.E.S.T.) trial, an ongoing, 30-week, open-label, multicenter investigation of once-daily MAS XR (10-60 mg/day) in adults (>or=18 years of age) with ADHD in community practice settings. FINDINGS: With up to 10 weeks of open-label MAS XR 10 to 60 mg/day (final visit mean dose: 37.2 mg/day), 725 adults exhibited rapid, sustained improvement in ADHD symptoms. At end point, significant decreases from baseline were seen in ADHD Rating Scale IV total scores (-19.8+/-11.6; P<.0001), hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale (-8.1+/-6.1; P<.0001), and inattentive subscale (-11.6+/-6.7; P<.0001). Most subjects (74.4%) were rated as very much/much improved. Based on the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (version 2), significant improvements in quality of life were seen in the domains of general health, physical and mental health, vitality, and social, emotional and physical role functioning (P<.0001). Few subjects (6.9%) withdrew due to adverse events; the most common MAS XR-related adverse events were decreased appetite and dry mouth (19.2% each), insomnia (17.8%), and headache (16.8%). CONCLUSION: In adults with ADHD, MAS XR treatment is generally safe and demonstrates significant improvement in ADHD symptoms and related quality of life.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Diagnosis information from existing data sources is used commonly for epidemiologic, administrative, and research purposes. The quality of such data for emergency department (ED) visits is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine the agreement on final diagnoses between two sources, electronic administrative sources and manually abstracted medical records, for pediatric ED visits, in a multicenter network. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study at 19 EDs nationwide. The authors obtained data from two sources at each ED during a three-month period in 2003: administrative sources for all visits and abstracted records for randomly selected visits during ten days over the study period. Records were matched using unique identifiers and probabilistic linkage. The authors recorded up to three diagnoses from each abstracted medical record and up to ten for the administrative data source. Diagnoses were grouped into 104 groups using a modification of the Clinical Classification System. RESULTS: A total of 8,860 abstracted records had at least one valid diagnosis code (with a total of 12,895 diagnoses) and were successfully matched to records in the administrative source. Overall, 67% (95% confidence interval = 66% to 68%) of diagnoses from the administrative and abstracted sources were within the same diagnosis group. Agreement varied by site, ranging from 54% to 77%. Agreement varied substantially by diagnosis group; there was no difference by method of linkage. Clustering clinically similar diagnosis groups improved agreement between administrative and abstracted data sources. CONCLUSIONS: ED diagnoses retrieved from electronic administrative sources and manual chart review frequently disagree, even if similar diagnosis codes are grouped. Agreement varies by institution and by diagnosis. Further work is needed to improve the accuracy of diagnosis coding; development of a grouping system specific to pediatric emergency care may be beneficial.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of glomerulonephritis, and many patients are at risk of at least slow progression. However, prediction of the renal outcome in individual patients remains difficult. METHODS: To develop a practical and user-friendly scheme for risk stratification of IgAN patients, data were extracted from a prospective cohort study conducted in 97 clinical units in Japan from 1995. Specifically, we examined deterioration in renal function, defined as doubling of serum creatinine, within 10 years of follow-up in 790 adult IgAN patients without substantial renal dysfunction at baseline using a decision tree induction algorithm. RESULTS: Recursive partitioning indicated that the best single predictor of renal deterioration was severe proteinuria on urine dipstick testing, followed by hypoalbuminaemia and the presence of mild haematuria for patients with and without severe proteinuria, respectively. Serum total protein levels, diastolic blood pressure and histological grade were placed in the third tier of the decision tree model. With these six variables, patients can be readily stratified into seven risk groups whose incidence of renal deterioration within 10-year follow-up ranges from 1.0% to 51.4%. Logistic regression also identified severe proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and mild haematuria as significant predictors of deterioration. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the prediction were comparable between the decision tree model and the logistic regression model [0.830 (95% confidence interval, 0.777-0.883) versus 0.808 (95% confidence interval, 0.754-0.861)]. CONCLUSION: Risk of substantial renal deterioration in IgAN patients can be validly estimated using six predictors obtained from clinical routine.},

We evaluated the prevalence of children using invasive HMV in Utah from 1996 to 2004. Residents of Utah, 16 years old and less ventilated via a tracheostomy between 1996 and 2004 were identified. Children ventilated in 1996 and 2004 were compared. Data including demographic information, diagnosis leading to HMV, and age at initiation were compared between the two groups. The prevalence of HMV in 1996 was 5.0/100,000 (95% CI: 4.4-8.1) and 6.3/100,000 (95% CI: 4.7-8.4) in 2004. Median age at initiation was 6.5 months (IQR: 1.3, 24.0). Sixty-one percent (n = 47) were male, 84% (n = 65) lived in an urban county, and 86% (n = 66) had public insurance. The most frequent diagnostic category was abnormal ventilatory control (n = 36, 47%), followed by chronic lung disease (n = 19, 25%), airway abnormalities (n = 12, 16%), and neuromuscular weakness (n = 10, 13%). Thirteen patients died (17%). The median length of HMV was 39 months (IQR: 15, 102). Diagnostic categories, age at initiation of HMV, and sex did not differ significantly over the 8 years. The prevalence of children requiring HMV differed very little between 1996 and 2004. Moreover, the diagnoses for which children received this therapy remained constant.},

  Abstract                 = {Newborns on ventilatory support often receive morphine to induce analgesia. Animal experiments suggest that this may impair subsequent cognitive and behavioral development. There are sparse human data on long-term effects of neonatal morphine. We aimed to investigate the effects of continuous morphine administered in the neonatal period on the child's functioning. We conducted a follow-up study among 5-year-olds who, as mechanically ventilated neonates, had participated in a placebo-controlled trial on effects of morphine administration on pain and neurologic outcome. They were now tested on intelligence, visual motor integration, behavior, chronic pain, and health-related quality of life. Univariate analyses showed significantly lower overall intelligence quotient (IQ) scores for children who earlier had received morphine, that is, mean 94 (SD 14.5) versus 100 (SD 12.9) for those who received placebo (P = 0.049). Other between-group differences in outcomes were not found. The statistical difference disappeared after correction for treatment condition, open-label morphine consumption over the first 28 days, and a propensity score for clinically relevant co-variables in multiple regression analyses. However, scores on one IQ subtest, "visual analysis," were significantly negatively related to having received morphine and to open-label morphine consumption the first 28 days. The finding of a significant effect of morphine on the "visual analysis" IQ subtest calls for follow-up at a later age focusing on the higher-order neurocognitive functions. Morphine received in the neonatal period has negative effects on the child's cognitive functioning at the age of 5 years which warrants follow-up at a later age.},

  Abstract                 = {When estimating the effect of treatment on HIV using data from observational studies, standard methods may produce biased estimates due to the presence of time-dependent confounders. Such confounding can be present when a covariate, affected by past exposure, is both a predictor of the future exposure and the outcome. One example is the CD4 cell count, being a marker for disease progression for HIV patients, but also a marker for treatment initiation and influenced by treatment. Fitting a marginal structural model (MSM) using inverse probability weights is one way to give appropriate adjustment for this type of confounding. In this paper we study a simple and intuitive approach to estimate similar treatment effects, using observational data to mimic several randomized controlled trials. Each 'trial' is constructed based on individuals starting treatment in a certain time interval. An overall effect estimate for all such trials is found using composite likelihood inference. The method offers an alternative to the use of inverse probability of treatment weights, which is unstable in certain situations. The estimated parameter is not identical to the one of an MSM, it is conditioned on covariate values at the start of each mimicked trial. This allows the study of questions that are not that easily addressed fitting an MSM. The analysis can be performed as a stratified weighted Cox analysis on the joint data set of all the constructed trials, where each trial is one stratum. The model is applied to data from the Swiss HIV cohort study.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence of snow-sports-related head injuries among children and adolescents reported to emergency departments (EDs), and to examine the trend from 1996 to 2010 in ED visits for snow-sports-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) among children and adolescents. METHODS: A retrospective, population-based cohort study was conducted using data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System for patients (aged </=17 years) treated in EDs in the USA from 1996 to 2010, for TBIs associated with snow sports (defined as skiing or snowboarding). National estimates of snow sports participation were obtained from the National Ski Area Association and utilised to calculate incidence rates. Analyses were conducted separately for children (aged 4-12 years) and adolescents (aged 13-17 years). RESULTS: An estimated number of 78 538 (95% CI 66 350 to 90 727) snow sports-related head injuries among children and adolescents were treated in EDs during the 14-year study period. Among these, 77.2% were TBIs (intracranial injury, concussion or fracture). The annual average incidence rate of TBI was 2.24 per 10 000 resort visits for children compared with 3.13 per 10 000 visits for adolescents. The incidence of TBI increased from 1996 to 2010 among adolescents (p<0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Given the increasing incidence of TBI among adolescents and the increased recognition of the importance of concussions, greater awareness efforts may be needed to ensure safety, especially helmet use, as youth engage in snow sports.},

  Abstract                 = {Phenytoin (DPH) is commonly used to treat seizures associated with acute head injury. Consequent to decreases in DPH protein binding in such patients, the DPH free fraction (DPHff) may increase and thereby produce symptoms compatible with DPH toxicity despite the presence of total serum concentrations within the usually accepted therapeutic range. We examined the effect of acute traumatic injury on DPH protein binding in 13 hospitalized pediatric patients. In addition to total and free DPH serum concentrations, biochemical variables including blood pH, total and direct bilirubin, serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, albumin, gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), and free fatty acid concentrations were measured serially over 10 days. The DPHff was compared between selected time intervals in hospitalized patients and data obtained in a control population of 27 epileptic outpatients who were maintained on DPH. Additionally, a multiple regression model was used to examine for covariance between the DPHff and the respective biochemical variables in the hospitalized patients. In the study patients, the DPHff progressively increased, attaining a maximum value (8.5 +/- 0.7%) on the fifth hospital day which was significantly greater (6.4 +/- 0.7%, p less than .05) than that on day 1 and also in the control group (6.1 +/- 0.3%; p less than .01). Blood pH, serum albumin, free fatty acids, creatinine and bilirubin concentrations did not change, but GGT did increase significantly over the 10-day sampling period. A significant (r = .51, p less than .0001) linear relationship was found between the DPHff and the serum albumin concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: One of the most perplexing features of systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is the association with macrophage activation syndrome, a life-threatening complication caused by excessive activation and proliferation of T cells and macrophages. The main purpose of the review is to summarize current understanding of the relation between macrophage activation syndrome and other clinically similar hemophagocytic disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinically, macrophage activation syndrome has strong similarities with familial and virus-associated reactive hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The better understood familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a constellation of rare, autosomal recessive immune disorders. The most consistent immunologic abnormalities in patients with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are decreased natural killer and cytotoxic cell functions. In approximately one third of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis patients, these immunologic abnormalities are secondary to mutations in the gene encoding perforin, a protein that mediates cytotoxic activity of natural killer and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Several recent studies have suggested that profoundly depressed natural killer cell activity and abnormal levels of perforin expression may be a feature of macrophage activation syndrome in systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis as well. Although it has been proposed that in both hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage activation syndrome, natural killer and cytotoxic cell dysfunction may lead to inadequate control of cellular immune responses, the exact nature of such dysregulation and the relation between macrophage activation syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis still remain to be determined.},

  Abstract                 = {We performed a retrospective review of patients admitted to two Level I trauma centres over a 15-year period with arterial injuries (excluding primary amputations). Preoperative factors analysed included mechanism of injury, site and type of arterial and venous injury and repair, time to operating room, initial blood pressure, evidence of ipsilateral limb fracture and/or extensive tissue damage, status of preoperative pulses and angiographic data. One hundred and fifty-one arterial injuries were treated (80 penetrating). Overall mortality was 10 (6.6%) and limb loss 16 (10.6%). Only two factors that might possibly be modified by specific interventions were noted. The incidence of limb loss was higher in patients who developed compartment syndrome (41% versus 7% without, P=0.003) and in those who did not receive intra- or immediately postoperative anticoagulation (15% without versus 3% with, P=0.02). Unfortunately, no factor was found that reliably predicted the risk of compartment syndrome. In addition, patients who did not receive peri-operative anticoagulation were more severely injured than those that did were. Despite this, there were no bleeding complications associated with anticoagulation. These findings suggest that the primary interventions that may improve limb salvage include liberal use of fasciotomy (recognising that any patient may require this) as well as early use of anticoagulation.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the rate of, and risk factors for, abusive head trauma (AHT) among infants born to military families and compare with civilian population rates. METHODS: Electronic International Classification of Diseases data from the US Department of Defense (DoD) Birth and Infant Health Registry were used to identify infants born to military families from 1998 through 2005 (N = 676 827) who met the study definition for AHT. DoD Family Advocacy Program data were used to identify infants with substantiated reports of abuse. Rates within the military were compared with civilian population rates by applying an alternate AHT case definition used in a civilian study. RESULTS: Applying the study definition, the estimated rate of substantiated military AHT was 34.0 cases in the first year of life per 100 000 live births. Using the alternate case definition, the estimated AHT rate was 25.6 cases per 100 000 live births. Infant risk factors for AHT included male sex, premature birth, and a diagnosed major birth defect. Parental risk factors included young maternal age (<21 years), lower sponsor rank or pay grade, and current maternal military service. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large database study of AHT with the ability to link investigative results to cases. Overall rates of AHT were consistent with civilian populations when using the same case definition codes. Infants most at risk, warranting special attention from military family support programs, include infants with parents in lower military pay grades, infants with military mothers, and infants born premature or with birth defects.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) is a serious and potentially life threatening histiocytic disorder in children and adults. The most commonly used protocol-based therapy includes corticosteroids, cyclosporine-A, and etoposide. However, patients are often started on corticosteroid alone with or without the addition of intravenous gamma-globulin. The role of the various therapies in HLH/MAS remains undefined. OBJECTIVE: To identify patient-related factors that led to the use of full protocol therapy (HLH 1994/2004) and to determine treatment-related factors that were associated with adverse outcome including relapse and death. DESIGN/METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed with HLH/MAS between January 1998 and December 2005 were included in this study. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients had a median age of 9.1 years at diagnosis. Underlying diagnoses were: viral/other 42%; rheumatologic 37%; and malignancy 21%. Initial treatment included corticosteroids 29%; intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 18%; steroids+IVIG 8%; cyclosporine 5%; etoposide 5%; HLH protocol 32%. Etoposide was eventually used in 21% (3/14) of rheumatology and 75% (18/25) viral/other patients. In all, 5/14 (36%) rheumatology and 12/16 (75%) viral/other patients required intensive care unit admission, and 1/14 (7.1%) rheumatology, and 6/16 (38%) viral/other patients died. Three children received a bone marrow transplant. Eleven of 38 (29%) patients died, despite 8 having received etoposide therapy. Three deaths were secondary to underlying malignancy and one from transplant-related complication for malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HLH are at high risk for death early in their disease course. However, corticosteroids and/or IVIG may be sufficient as first-line therapy for patients with underlying rheumatologic disease who present with HLH/MAS. Further prospective studies are required to more precisely define early risk factors for poor outcomes in this often fatal disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Difficulties with negotiating and achieving desired social outcomes in life may be exacerbated by the experience of childhood cancer, including adverse effects from therapies used to achieve a cure. This review of previous publications from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) and other relevant literature provides insight into the prevalence of, and risk factors for, poor educational attainment, less than optimal employment status, and interpersonal relationship issues among long-term survivors of childhood cancer. The impacts of emotional health and physical disability on social outcomes are also examined. Study results suggest that childhood cancer survivors generally have similar high school graduation rates, but are more likely to require special education services than sibling comparison groups. Survivors are slightly less likely than expected to attend college, and are more likely to be unemployed and not married as young adults. Cancers and treatments that result in impairment to the CNS, particularly brain tumors, or that impact sensory functioning, such as hearing loss, are associated with greater risk for undesirable social outcomes, as are emotional health problems and physical disability. This review of relevant data from CCSS and other studies provides information on risk factors for social problems into adulthood. A greater understanding of the long-term social impacts from the diagnosis and treatment of childhood cancer is critically important for developing targeted interventions to prevent or ameliorate adverse psychosocial effects.},

  Abstract                 = {There is ample and compelling evidence to suggest that medications are frequently used inappropriately in the nursing home. The occurrence of avoidable adverse drug reactions is the most serious consequence of inappropriate prescribing; economic implications are also of interest. With increasing concern over the quality of care in nursing homes, and with the revision of regulations governing such care by the Health Care Financing Administration, it is important to consider the experience thus far in monitoring and improving drug use in nursing homes. A number of studies have investigated approaches designed to reduce inappropriate prescribing and drug utilization in this setting. In contrast to the wide range of approaches that have been evaluated and implemented in the hospital setting, interventions in the nursing home have centered primarily around consultant-pharmacist activities. Although these activities are now federally mandated in all nursing homes, there is little evidence from adequately controlled studies to document their impact or cost-effectiveness. By contrast, face-to-face educational interventions directed at physicians ("academic detailing") have been shown to be effective in improving prescribing for some medications. The prominent role played by the nursing staff in the utilization of many medications in the nursing home implies that an educational intervention excluding nursing staff would be insufficient to influence drug utilization positively in many situations (eg, psychoactive medications and laxatives). Future research efforts must pay greater attention to adequate study design considerations as well as to the clinical outcomes of such interventions and their cost-effectiveness.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To identify and to generate national estimates of the principal gastrointestinal (GI) diagnoses associated with hospital utilization and to describe national hospital utilization patterns associated with pediatric GI disorders. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed a nationwide and stratified probability sample of 1.9 million hospital discharges from 1997 of children 18 years and younger, weighted to 6.7 million discharges nationally. Principal GI diagnoses were identified through the use of the Clinical Classification Software and Major Diagnostic Categories. RESULTS: In 1997 in the United States, there were 329,825 pediatric discharges associated with a principal GI diagnosis, accounting for more than 2.6 billion US dollars in hospital charges and more than 1.1 million hospital days. Appendicitis, intestinal infection, noninfectious gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, esophageal disorders, and digestive congenital anomalies combined accounted for 75.1% of GI discharge diagnoses, 64.2% of GI hospital charges, and 68.0% of GI hospital days. Excluding normal newborn infants and conditions related to pregnancy, GI disorders were the third leading cause of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: GI disorders are a leading cause of hospitalization of children. A minority of GI conditions account for the majority of measures of utilization. Children are hospitalized for GI conditions and at institutions that are distinct from adults.},

Ten of 16 (63%) patients randomized to RHC, and 9 of 17 (53%) to no RHC, died (difference: -10%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -43% to 24%). Mean number of days in the intensive care unit were 10.3 for RHC and 8.1 for no RHC (difference, -2.2; CI, -10.2 to 5.8). The lowest modified APACHE score achieved after randomization was 10.8 for RHC and 8.1 for no RHC (difference, -3.8; CI, -7.0 to -0.6), and the mean modified APACHE score was 14.4 for RHC and 11.1 for no RHC (difference, -3.3; CI, -6.47 to -0.2). Physiological measures in this trial showed statistically significant differences in favor of patients not receiving RHC. Confidence intervals around other outcomes include clinically important differences in favor of both RHC and control groups. Although other controlled trials of RHC are crucial, investigators face major practical difficulties.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe the safety and risks of placing pediatric patients in the prone position during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for the treatment of respiratory failure. DESIGN: Single-center retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary pediatric ICUs. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to the pediatric ICU who required ECMO for respiratory failure from 1995 to 2000. INTERVENTIONS: None. Measurements and results: Medical records for 93 patients representing 95 ECMO runs for treatment of respiratory failure were reviewed. Of these, 63 patients (66%) received intermittent prone positioning. Demographic data and clinical information were recorded. The median age was 12 months, and the median weight was 9.8 kg. There were 962 position changes. Complications surveyed for included bleeding from appliance insertion sites, appliance dislodgment, unplanned extubation, cutaneous pressure ulceration, corneal abrasion, and extreme hemodynamic instability. These complications were noted as to whether they were present prior to the initiation of prone positioning or whether they developed after prone positioning began. Twenty-four percent of patients had bleeding from cannulation sites prior to prone positioning, and 18% of patients had bleeding begin after prone positioning was initiated. Two patients had chest tubes dislodge after prone positioning began, but neither patient had bleeding occur or required reinsertion of the chest tube. There were no unplanned extubations, appliance displacements, development of cutaneous pressure ulcerations, or corneal abrasions associated with prone-positioning maneuvers. No patient had ECMO support removed secondary to the surveyed complications. Eighty-two percent of children who received prone positioning during ECMO for treatment of respiratory failure survived to hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: We found that prone positioning may be used in pediatric ECMO patients without increasing the risk of complications. A multi-institutional, prospective, randomized, controlled study would better evaluate the efficacy of this practice and whether it is associated with a shorter length of ECMO or shorter post-ECMO ventilation and outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The influence of central corneal thickness (CCT) on the measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) has been discussed extensively in recent years. The problem, however, has not been solved so far. In addition to CCT there are probably further biomechanical properties that play a role in IOP measurement. We wanted to find out whether these properties are related to Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT), noncontact tonometry (NCT), or CCT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Biomechanical properties of the cornea such as corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) can be measured with the Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA, Reichert Ophthalmic Instruments, Depew, NY, USA). Furthermore, a corneal compensated IOP (IOPcc) is given. We examined 156 normal eyes of 80 patients who did not show corneal pathology nor glaucoma. In each eye GAT, NCT, and ORA data as well as CCT were measured. Data were statistically analyzed with respect to agreement and the influence of CH and CRF on IOP measurement. RESULTS: In our patients the following average values were calculated: GAT 14.8+/-3.0 mmHg, NCT 16.4+/-3.9 mmHg, IOPcc 16.2+/-4.1 mmHg, CH 10.6+/-2.3 mmHg, CRF 10.9+/-2.4 mmHg, and CCT 557+/-36 microm. IOPcc was not related to CCT in normal eyes and the only IOP value related to CH (p<0.01). CRF, however, was related to GAT and NCT values (p<0.01). DISCUSSION: In our group of normal eyes IOPcc, i.e., the value that is adjusted by measurement of viscoelastic properties of the cornea, in contrast to GAT and NCT does not depend on central corneal thickness. Corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor provide further information about biomechanical properties of the cornea beyond central corneal thickness.},

Ninety-two of 937 children with head injuries (9.8\%) experienced posttraumatic seizures. In 94.5\% of these patients (87 of 92), seizures developed within the first 24 hours after injury. Three children convulsed between 24 hours and 7 days, but only 2 children developed seizures after the 1st week. Factors found to influence the likelihood of seizures included severe head injury (GCS, 3 to 8), diffuse cerebral edema, and acute subdural hematoma (P less than 0.001). Seizures occurred in 35\% of severely head-injured children compared to 5.1\% with minor head injury (P less than 0.001). A less significant correlation (P less than 0.1) was noted between seizures and open, depressed skull fractures. We found no significant correlation between seizure occurrence and numerous other factors including age, sex, fracture location and type (other than open, depressed fractures), parenchymal injuries, fixed neurological deficits, and cranial operation. Based on our observations, we recommend the prophylactic use of anticonvulsants in children at higher risk for posttraumatic seizures: those with diffuse cerebral edema, acute subdural hematoma, open, depressed skull fracture with parenchymal damage, or severe head injury (GCS less than or equal to 8).},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine if insurance or race status affect trauma outcomes in pediatric trauma patients. METHODS: Using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB; v6.2), the following variables were extracted: age (0-17 years), payment type (insured, Medicaid/Medicare, or self-pay), race (white, Black/African American, or Hispanic), Injury Severity Score (ISS > 8), type of trauma (blunt or penetrating), and discharge status (alive or dead). Data were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 70,781 patient visits analyzed, 67% were insured, 23% were Medicaid/Medicare, and 10% were self-pay. Self-pay patients had higher mortality (11%, compared to Medicaid/Medicare at 5% and insured at 4%; p < 0.001). African Americans and Hispanics also had higher mortality (7 and 6%) compared to whites (4%; p < 0.001). Self-pay patients more likely suffered penetrating trauma than insured patients (12% vs. 4%; p < 0.001), and mortality for penetrating trauma self-pay patients was 29%, compared to only 11% for penetrating trauma insured patients (p < 0.001). The mortality rate varied from a low of 3% for insured whites, to 18% for self-pay African Americans. Logistic regression (including race, insurance status, injury type, and ISS) revealed that African Americans and Hispanics both had an increased risk of death compared to whites (African American odds ratio [OR] = 1.37, Hispanic OR = 1.20). Medicaid/Medicare patients had a slightly increased risk of death with OR = 1.14, but self-pay patients were almost three times more likely to die (adjusted OR = 2.92). CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for ISS and type of injury, mortality disparity exists for uninsured, African American, and Hispanic pediatric trauma patients. Although the reasons for this are unclear, efforts to decrease these disparities are needed.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of inhaled tobramycin (TOBI) in the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in a randomized, double-blind pilot study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients from a cohort of 108 mechanically ventilated patients with documented clinical and bacteriological evidence of VAP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter spp. in the surgical and trauma intensive care units of a university teaching hospital were randomized to receive either TOBI (n = 5) or intravenous tobramycin (TOBRA; n = 5). The two groups were similar in their Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score, Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), and Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS) prior to randomization. The primary outcome measure was resolution of pneumonia. The CPIS and MODS were used as objective indicators of clinical progress. RESULTS: All TOBI patients had clinical resolution of VAP. Two TOBRA patients were considered failures. One had deterioration in MODS, and the other had doubling of his serum creatinine concentration. The patients treated with TOBI may have had more ventilator-free days than those receiving TOBRA, but the difference was not statistically significant owing to the small sample size (24 +/- 3 vs. 14 +/- 13 days; p = 0.12). CONCLUSION: Aerosolized tobramycin for the treatment of VAP appeared safe and effective in this pilot study. A larger study is warranted to determine if aerosolized tobramycin will lead to better outcomes than intravenous tobramycin when used for the treatment of VAP.},

The incidence of adverse drug effects during the first 2 weeks of treatment, however, was low and not significantly different between the treated and placebo groups. Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 0.6\% of the patients in the phenytoin-treated group compared with 0\% in the placebo group (p = 1.0) during week 1, and in 2.5\% of phenytoin-treated compared with 0\% of placebo-treated patients (p = 0.12) for the first 2 weeks of treatment. Mortality rates were also similar in both groups. Although the mortality rate was higher in patients who developed seizures, this increase was related to the greater severity of the injuries sustained by these patients at the time of the original trauma.The results of this study indicate that the incidence of early posttraumatic seizure can be effectively reduced by prophylactic administration of phenytoin for 1 or 2 weeks without a significant increase in drug-related side effects. Reduction in posttraumatic seizure during the 1st week, however, was not associated with a reduction in the mortality rate.},

  Abstract                 = {Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common occurrence among intubated pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. However, little is known about the epidemiology, risk factors, and microbiology of VAP in pediatric TBI. We reviewed a cohort of 119 pediatric moderate-to-severe TBI patients and identified 42 with VAP by positive protected bronchial brush specimens. Location of intubation, severity of injury, and antibiotic administration within 2 days after injury were not associated with VAP. Most treatments for elevated intracranial pressure were associated with increased risk of VAP; however, in a multi-variable analysis barbiturate coma (hazard ratio [HR], 3.2; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-7.3), neuromuscular blockade (NMBA; HR, 3.4; 95\% CI 1.6-7.3), and use of a cooling blanket for euthermia (HR 2.4; 95\% CI 1.1-5.5) remained independently associated with VAP. Most VAP (55\%) occurred prior to hospital Day 4 and only 7\% developed VAP after Day 7. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (34\%), Haemophilus influenzae (22\%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (15\%) were the most common organisms, comprising 71\% of isolated pathogens (36\% of infections were polymicrobial). Patients with VAP had significantly longer intensive care unit and hospital stays, as well as increased risk of chronic care needs after discharge, but not mortality. VAP is a common occurrence in pediatric TBI patients, and early empiric therapy for patients requiring barbiturate infusion, NMBA, or use of a cooling blanket could mitigate morbidity.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: For patients with coronary heart disease, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improves survival rate and has beneficial effects on risk factors for coronary artery disease. The relationship between the number of sessions attended and long-term outcomes is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a national 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries, we identified 30 161 elderly patients who attended at least 1 cardiac rehabilitation session between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2005. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the relationship between the number of sessions attended and death and myocardial infarction (MI) at 4 years. The cumulative number of sessions was a time-dependent covariate. After adjustment for demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and subsequent hospitalization, patients who attended 36 sessions had a 14% lower risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 0.97) and a 12% lower risk of MI (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.93) than those who attended 24 sessions; a 22% lower risk of death (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.87) and a 23% lower risk of MI (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.87) than those who attended 12 sessions; and a 47% lower risk of death (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.59) and a 31% lower risk of MI (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.81) than those who attended 1 session. CONCLUSIONS: Among Medicare beneficiaries, a strong dose-response relationship existed between the number of cardiac rehabilitation sessions and long-term outcomes. Attending all 36 sessions reimbursed by Medicare was associated with lower risks of death and MI at 4 years compared with attending fewer sessions.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Inpatient clinical registries generally have limited ability to provide a longitudinal perspective on care beyond the acute episode. We present a method to link hospitalization records from registries with Medicare inpatient claims data, without using direct identifiers, to create a unique data source that pairs rich clinical data with long-term outcome data. METHODS AND RESULTS: The method takes advantage of the hospital clustering observed in each database by demonstrating that different combinations of indirect identifiers within hospitals yield a large proportion of unique patient records. This high level of uniqueness also allows linking without advance knowledge of the Medicare provider number of each registry hospital. We applied this method to 2 inpatient databases and were able to identify 81% of 39,178 records in a large clinical registry of patients with heart failure and 91% of 6,581 heart failure records from a hospital inpatient database. The quality of the link is high, and reasons for incomplete linkage are explored. Finally, we discuss the unique opportunities afforded by combining claims and clinical data for specific analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of direct identifiers, it is possible to create a high-quality link between inpatient clinical registry data and Medicare claims data. The method will allow researchers to use existing data to create a linked claims-clinical database that capitalizes on the strengths of both types of data sources.},

Of 183 participants, 161 patients experienced 1 RTAC episode, 17 had 2, and 5 had 3. The mean time from rehabilitation admission to first RTAC was 22±22 days. The mean duration in acute care during RTAC was 7±8 days. Eighty-four participants (46\%) had ≥1 RTAC episodes for medical reasons, 102 (56\%) had ≥1 RTAC episodes for surgical reasons, and 6 (3\%) participants had RTAC episodes for unknown reasons. Most common surgical RTAC reasons were neurosurgical (65\%), pulmonary (9\%), infection (5\%), and orthopedic (5\%); most common medical reasons were infection (26\%), neurological (23\%), and cardiac (12\%). Any RTAC was predicted as more likely for patients with older age, history of coronary artery disease, history of congestive heart failure, acute care diagnosis of depression, craniotomy or craniectomy during acute care, and presence of dysphagia at rehabilitation admission. RTAC was less likely for patients with higher admission FIM motor scores and education less than high school diploma. RTAC occurrence during rehabilitation was significantly associated with longer RLOS and smaller likelihood of discharge home.Approximately 9\% of patients with TBI experienced RTAC episodes during inpatient rehabilitation for various medical and surgical reasons. This information may help inform interventions aimed at reducing interruptions in rehabilitation for RTAC. RTACs were associated with longer RLOS and discharge to an institutional setting.},

The mean time from rehabilitation discharge to first rehospitalization was 113 days. The mean rehospitalization duration was 6.5 days. Logistic regression analyses revealed that older age, history of seizures before injury or during acute care or rehabilitation, history of brain injuries, and non-brain injury medical severity increased the risk of rehospitalization. Injury etiology of motor vehicle collision and high motor functioning at discharge decreased rehospitalization risk.Approximately 28\% of patients with TBI were rehospitalized within 9 months of TBI rehabilitation discharge owing to various medical and surgical reasons. Future research should evaluate whether some of these occurrences may be preventable (such as infections, injuries, and psychiatric disorders) and should evaluate the extent to which persons at risk may benefit from additional screening, surveillance, and treatment protocols.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Experimental and clinical studies of septic shock support the concept that early resuscitation with fluid and inotropic therapies improves survival in a time-dependent manner. The new American College of Critical Care Medicine-Pediatric Advanced Life Support (ACCM-PALS) Guidelines for hemodynamic support of newborns and children in septic shock recommend this therapeutic approach. The objective of this study was to determine whether early septic shock reversal and use of resuscitation practice consistent with the new ACCM-PALS Guidelines by community physicians is associated with improved outcome. METHODS: A 9-year (January 1993-December 2001) retrospective cohort study was conducted of 91 infants and children who presented to local community hospitals with septic shock and required transport to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Shock reversal (defined by return of normal systolic blood pressure and capillary refill time), resuscitation practice concurrence with ACCM-PALS Guidelines, and hospital mortality were measured. RESULTS: Overall, 26 (29%) patients died. Community physicians successfully achieved shock reversal in 24 (26%) patients at a median time of 75 minutes (when the transport team arrived at the patient's bedside), which was associated with 96% survival and >9-fold increased odds of survival (9.49 [1.07-83.89]). Each additional hour of persistent shock was associated with >2-fold increased odds of mortality (2.29 [1.19-4.44]). Nonsurvivors, compared with survivors, were treated with more inotropic therapies (dopamine/dobutamine [42% vs 20%] and epinephrine/norepinephrine [42% vs 6%]) but not increased fluid therapy (median volume; 32.9 mL/kg vs 20.0 mL/kg). Resuscitation practice was consistent with ACCM-PALS Guidelines in only 27 (30%) patients; however, when practice was in agreement with guideline recommendations, a lower mortality was observed (8% vs 38%). CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and aggressive resuscitation of pediatric-neonatal septic shock by community physicians can save lives. Educational programs that promote ACCM-PALS recommended rapid, stepwise escalations in fluid as well as inotropic therapies may have value in improving outcomes in these children.},

  Abstract                 = {Guanabenz (2,6-dichlorobenzylidene-amino-guanidine) is a centrally acting antihypertensive drug whose mechanism of action is via alpha2 adrenoceptors or, more likely, imidazoline receptors. Guanabenz is marketed as an antihypertensive agent in human medicine (Wytensin tablets, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals). Guanabenz has reportedly been administered to racing horses and is classified by the Association of Racing Commissioners International as a class 3 foreign substance. As such, its identification in a postrace sample may result in significant sanctions against the trainer of the horse. The present study examined liquid chromatographic/tandem quadrupole mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) detection of guanabenz in serum samples from horses treated with guanabenz by rapid i.v. injection at 0.04 and 0.2 mg/kg. Using a method adapted from previous work with clenbuterol, the parent compound was detected in serum with an apparent limit of detection of approximately 0.03 ng/ml and the limit of quantitation was 0.2 ng/ml. Serum concentrations of guanabenz peaked at approximately 100 ng/ml after the 0.2 mg/kg dose, and the parent compound was detected for up to 8 hours after the 0.04 mg/kg dose. Urine samples tested after administration of guanabenz at these dosages yielded evidence of at least one glucuronide metabolite, with the glucuronide ring apparently linked to a ring hydroxyl group or a guanidinium hydroxylamine. The LC-MS/MS results presented here form the basis of a confirmatory test for guanabenz in racing horses.},

  Abstract                 = {Delays, omissions, and inaccuracy of discharge information are common at hospital discharge and put patients at risk for adverse outcomes. We assembled an interdisciplinary team of stakeholders to evaluate our current discharge process between hospitalists and primary care providers (PCPs). We used a fishbone diagram to identify potential causes of suboptimal discharge communication to PCPs. Opportunities for improvement (leverage points) to achieve optimal transfer of discharge information were identified using tally sheets and Pareto charts. Quality improvement strategies consisted of training and implementation of a new discharge process including: (1) enhanced PCP identification at discharge, (2) use of an electronic discharge order and instruction system, and (3) autofaxing discharge information to PCPs. The new discharge process's impact was evaluated on 2,530 hospitalist patient discharges over a 34-week period by measuring: (1) successful transfer of discharge information (proportion of discharge information sheets successfully faxed to PCPs), (2) timeliness (proportion of sheets faxed within 2 days of discharge), and (3) content (presence of key clinical elements in discharge sheets). Postintervention, success, and timeliness of discharge information transfer between pediatric hospitalists and PCPs significantly improved while content remained high.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Existing research on hospitalist-primary care provider (PCP) communication focuses mainly on adult hospitalist models with little known about the quality of current pediatric hospitalist-PCP communication. Our objective was to perform a needs assessment by exploring important issues around communication between pediatric hospitalists and PCPs. METHODS: Six previously identified issues around hospitalist-PCP communication from the adult hospitalist literature were abstracted and incorporated into an open-ended and closed-ended questionnaire. The questionnaire was pretested, revised, and administered by phone to 10 pediatric hospitalists and 12 pediatric PCPs residing in our 5-state catchment area. Interviews were transcribed and openly coded, and themes compared using qualitative methods. RESULTS: The 6 identified issues were: quality of communication, barriers to communication, methods of information sharing, key data element requirements, critical timing, and perceived benefits. Hospitalists and PCPs rated overall quality of communication from "poor" to "very good." Both groups acknowledge that significant barriers to optimal communication currently exist, yet the barriers differ for each group. Hospitalists and PCPs agree on what information is important to transmit (diagnoses, medications, follow-up needs, and pending laboratory test results) and critical times for communication during the hospitalization (at discharge, admission, and during major clinical changes). Both groups also agree that optimal communication could improve many aspects of patient care. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying and addressing barriers to these 6 issues may help both hospitalists and PCPs implement targeted interventions aimed at improving communication. Future studies will need to demonstrate the link between improved hospitalist-PCP communication and improved patient care and outcomes.},

As an example, the method is applied to the use of the treadmill exercise test in evaluating the prognosis of patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

  Abstract                 = {Regression models such as the Cox proportional hazards model have had increasing use in modelling and estimating the prognosis of patients with a variety of diseases. Many applications involve a large number of variables to be modelled using a relatively small patient sample. Problems of overfitting and of identifying important covariates are exacerbated in analysing prognosis because the accuracy of a model is more a function of the number of events than of the sample size. We used a general index of predictive discrimination to measure the ability of a model developed on training samples of varying sizes to predict survival in an independent test sample of patients suspected of having coronary artery disease. We compared three methods of model fitting: (1) standard 'step-up' variable selection, (2) incomplete principal components regression, and (3) Cox model regression after developing clinical indices from variable clusters. We found regression using principal components to offer superior predictions in the test sample, whereas regression using indices offers easily interpretable models nearly as good as the principal components models. Standard variable selection has a number of deficiencies.},

We engineered sensors based on the staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin pore to allow the single-molecule detection and characterization of protein kinase-peptide interactions. We enhanced this approach by using site-specific proteolysis to generate pores bearing a single peptide sensor element attached by an N-terminal peptide bond to the trans mouth of the pore. Kinetics and affinities for the Pim protein kinases (Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase were measured and found to be independent of membrane potential and in good agreement with previously reported data. Kinase binding exhibited a distinct current noise behavior that forms a basis for analyte discrimination. Finally, we observed unusually high association rate constants for the interaction of Pim kinases with their consensus substrate Pimtide (~10(7) to 10(8) M(-1) . s(-1)), the result of electrostatic enhancement, and propose a cellular role for this phenomenon.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Pathological waves of spreading mass neuronal depolarisation arise repeatedly in injured, but potentially salvageable, grey matter in 50-60% of patients after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We aimed to ascertain whether spreading depolarisations are independently associated with unfavourable neurological outcome. METHODS: We did a prospective, observational, multicentre study at seven neurological centres. We enrolled 109 adults who needed neurosurgery for acute TBI. Spreading depolarisations were monitored by electrocorticography during intensive care and were classified as cortical spreading depression (CSD) if they took place in spontaneously active cortex or as isoelectric spreading depolarisation (ISD) if they took place in isoelectric cortex. Investigators who treated patients and assessed outcome were masked to electrocorticographic results. Scores on the extended Glasgow outcome scale at 6 months were fitted to a multivariate model by ordinal regression. Prognostic score (based on variables at admission, as validated by the IMPACT studies) and spreading depolarisation category (none, CSD only, or at least one ISD) were assessed as outcome predictors. FINDINGS: Six individuals were excluded because of poor-quality electrocorticography. A total of 1328 spreading depolarisations arose in 58 (56%) patients. In 38 participants, all spreading depolarisations were classified as CSD; 20 patients had at least one ISD. By multivariate analysis, both prognostic score (p=0.0009) and spreading depolarisation category (p=0.0008) were significant predictors of neurological outcome. CSD and ISD were associated with an increased risk of unfavourable outcome (common odds ratios 1.56 [95% CI 0.72-3.37] and 7.58 [2.64-21.8], respectively). Addition of depolarisation category to the regression model increased the proportion of variance in outcome that could be attributed to predictors from 9% to 22%, compared with the prognostic score alone. INTERPRETATION: Spreading depolarisations were associated with unfavourable outcome, after controlling for conventional prognostic variables. The possibility that spreading depolarisations have adverse effects on the traumatically injured brain, and therefore might be a target in the treatment of TBI, deserves further research.

Twenty-one of 32 children (66\%) underwent electroencephalographic monitoring. Those monitored were more likely to have a lower admission Glasgow Coma Scale (8 vs 15, p = 0.05) and be intubated (16 vs 2, p = 0.002). Electrographic seizures occurred in 12 of 21 children (57\%) and constituted electrographic status epilepticus in 8 of 12 children (67\%). Electrographic seizures were entirely nonconvulsive in 8 of 12 children (67\%). Electroencephalographic background category (discontinuous and slow-disorganized) (p = 0.02) and neuroimaging evidence of ischemia were associated with the presence of electrographic seizures (p = 0.05). Subjects who had electrographic seizures were no more likely to have clinical seizures at admission (67\% electrographic seizures vs 33\% none, p = 0.6), parenchymal imaging abnormalities (61\% electrographic seizures vs 39\% none, p = 0.40), or extra-axial imaging abnormalities (56\% electrographic seizures vs 44\% none, p = 0.72). Four of 21 (19\%) children died prior to discharge; none had electrographic seizures, but all had attenuated-featureless electroencephalographic backgrounds. Follow-up outcome data were available for 16 of 17 survivors at a median duration of 9.5 months following PICU admission, and the presence of electrographic seizures or electrographic status epilepticus was not associated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale score (p = 0.10).Electrographic seizures and electrographic status epilepticus are common in children with abusive head trauma. Most seizures have no clinical correlate. Further study is needed to determine whether seizure identification and management improves outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {Here we present a set of methods for documenting (exo-)morphology by applying autofluorescence imaging. For arthropods, but also for other taxa, autofluorescence imaging combined with composite imaging is a fast documentation method with high-resolution capacities. Compared to conventional micro- and macrophotography, the illumination is much more homogenous, and structures are often better contrasted. Applying different wavelengths to the same object can additionally be used to enhance distinct structures. Autofluorescence imaging can be applied to dried and embedded specimens, but also directly on specimens within their storage liquid. This has an enormous potential for the documentation of rare specimens and especially type specimens without the need of preparation. Also for various fossils, autofluorescence can be used to enhance the contrast between the fossil and the matrix significantly, making even smallest details visible. 'Life-colour' fluorescence especially is identified as a technique with great potential. It provides additional information for which otherwise more complex methods would have to be applied. The complete range of differences and variations between fluorescence macrophotography and different types of fluorescence microscopy techniques are here explored and evaluated in detail. Also future improvements are suggested. In summary, autofluorescence imaging is a powerful, easy and fast-to-apply tool for morphological studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract We present a technique for extracting 3D information from small-scale fossil and Recent material and give a summary of other contemporary techniques for 3D methods of investigation. The only hardware needed for the here-presented technique is a microscope that can perform dark field and/or differential interference contrast with a mounted digital camera and a computer. Serial images are taken while the focus is successively shifted from the uppermost end of the specimen to the lowermost end, resulting in about 200 photographs. The data are then processed almost completely automatically by successive use of three freely available programs. Firstly, the stack of images is aligned by the use of CombineZM, which is used to produce a combined image with a high depth of field. Secondly, the aligned images are cropped and sharp edges extracted with the aid of ImageJ. Thirdly, although ImageJ is also capable of producing 3D representations, we preferred to process the image stack further using osirix as it has the facility to export various formats. One of the interesting export formats is a virtual Quicktime movie file (QTVR), which can be used for documentation, and stereo images can also be produced from this Quicktime VR. This method is easy to apply and can be used for documenting specimens in 3D (at least some aspects) without having to prepare them. Therefore, it is particularly useful as a safe method for documenting limited material, before using methods that may destroy the specimen of interest, or to investigate type material that cannot be treated with any preparatory technique. As light microscopes are available in most labs and free computer programs are easily accessible, this method can be readily applied.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Substantial uncertainty persists about the indications for radioactive iodine for thyroid cancer. Use of radioactive iodine over time and the correlates of its use remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine practice patterns, the degree to which hospitals vary in their use of radioactive iodine, and factors that contribute to this variation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Time trend analysis of radioactive iodine use in a cohort of 189,219 patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer treated at 981 hospitals associated with the US National Cancer Database between 1990 and 2008. We used multilevel analysis to assess the correlates of patient and hospital characteristics on radioactive iodine use in the cohort treated from 2004 to 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Use of radioactive iodine after total thyroidectomy. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2008, across all tumor sizes, there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer receiving radioactive iodine (1373/3397 [40.4%] vs 11,539/20,620 [56.0%]; P < .001). Multivariable analysis of patients treated from 2004 to 2008 found that there was a statistical difference in radioactive iodine use between American Joint Committee on Cancer stages I and IV (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.37) but not between stages II/III and IV (for stage II vs stage IV, OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.88-1.07 and for stage III vs stage IV, OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.95-1.17). In addition to patient and tumor characteristics, hospital volume was associated with radioactive iodine use. Wide variation in radioactive iodine use existed, and only 21.1% of this variation was accounted for by patient and tumor characteristics. Hospital type and case volume accounted for 17.1% of the variation. After adjusting for available patient, tumor, and hospital characteristics, 29.1% of the variance was attributable to unexplained hospital characteristics. CONCLUSION: Among patients treated for well-differentiated thyroid cancer at hospitals in the National Cancer Database, there was an increase in the proportion receiving radioactive iodine between 1990 and 2008; much of the variation in use was associated with hospital characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {Systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA) is a rare inflammatory disorder. It can result in disease and treatment-related disability. SoJIA is characterized by remitting fevers, evanescent rash, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly/splenomegaly, and/or serositis. Non-responsiveness to standard therapy with corticosteroids and disease modifying antirheumatic drugs is not uncommon. IL-1beta has been shown to be a main contributor to the pathogenesis of SoJIA. Anakinra, a recombinant IL-1beta receptor antagonist, was shown to be effective in small cohorts of therapy-resistant adult and pediatric Still's patients. In order to assess the efficacy and safety of first-line anakinra treatment in SoJIA, we reviewed the charts of all SoJIA patients in our institution from 2005 to 2010, searching for first-line anakinra-treated patients. We report the clinical and laboratory course of four SoJIA patients. The mean follow-up was 13.5 (range: 2-50) months. Anakinra was started at doses from 1.5 to 4 mg/kg for a median duration of 3 (range: 3-18) months. Two patients responded to anakinra mono-therapy; two cases required corticosteroids. Normalized body temperatures and the absence of evanescent rashes were achieved after a median of 4 (range: 2-10) days. We did not see treatment-related adverse reactions other than local injection site inflammation. This is the first single-center series, reporting anakinra as first-line treatment in SoJIA. We show rapid efficacy of anakinra in early SoJIA with reduced treatment-related side effects. A subset of patients remains corticosteroid dependent. Further studies are warranted to follow larger cohorts and to assess long-term safety.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To compare restraint-use practices and injuries among children in crashes with grandparent versus parent drivers. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of motor vehicle crashes that occurred from January 15, 2003, to November 30, 2007, involving children aged 15 years or younger, with cases identified via insurance claims and data collected via follow-up telephone surveys. We calculated the relative risk of significant child-passenger injury for grandparent-driven versus parent-driven vehicles. Logistic regression modeling estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for several child occupant, driver, vehicle, and crash characteristics. RESULTS: Children driven by grandparents comprised 9.5% of the sample but resulted in only 6.6% of the total injuries. Injuries were reported for 1302 children, for an overall injury rate of 1.02 (95% CI: 0.90-1.17) per 100 child occupants. These represented 161 weighted injuries (0.70% injury rate) with grandparent drivers and 2293 injuries (1.05% injury rate) with parent drivers. Although nearly all children were reported to have been restrained, children in crashes with grandparent drivers used optimal restraint slightly less often. Despite this, children in grandparent-driven crashes were at one-half the risk of injuries as those in parent-driven crashes (OR: 0.50 [95% CI: 0.33- 0.75]) after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Grandchildren seem to be safer in crashes when driven by grandparents than by their parents, but safety could be enhanced if grandparents followed current child-restraint guidelines. Additional elucidation of safe grandparent driving practices when carrying their grandchildren may inform future child-occupant driving education guidelines for all drivers.},

In HLH-2004 three additional criteria are introduced; low/absent NK-cell-activity, hyperferritinemia, and high-soluble interleukin-2-receptor levels. Altogether five of these eight criteria must be fulfilled, unless family history or molecular diagnosis is consistent with HLH. HLH-2004 chemo-immunotherapy includes etoposide, dexamethasone, cyclosporine A upfront and, in selected patients, intrathecal therapy with methotrexate and corticosteroids. Subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is recommended for patients with familial disease or molecular diagnosis, and patients with severe and persistent, or reactivated, disease. In order to hopefully further improve diagnosis, therapy and biological understanding, participation in HLH studies is encouraged.},

  Abstract                 = {Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is, without treatment, an invariably fatal disease of infancy and early childhood characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and a widespread accumulation of T-lymphocytes and macrophages. During recent years, the diagnosis and the survival as well as the understanding of the disease have improved dramatically. Recent studies suggest that FHL is caused by impaired lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity and defective triggering of apoptosis, and that the symptoms are mediated by a pro-inflammatory hypercytokinemia. Moreover, specific genetic alterations, mutations in the perforin gene, have been revealed in FHL patients. Perforin, which normally is secreted from cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells upon conjugation between effector and target cells, is able to insert into the membrane of the target cell. It there polymerizes to form a cell death-inducing pore through which toxic granzymes may enter the cell and trigger apoptosis. The establishment of perforin deficiency as a cause of the rapidly fatal disease FHL has demonstrated the essential role of perforin in human immune homeostasis.},

The lipoprotein pattern in nine children with FHL was studied with a quantitative method measuring cholesterol and triglycerides in each major class of lipoproteins. Triglycerides were markedly elevated during active FHL in serum, very low density lipoproteins, and low density lipoproteins. Cholesterol was increased in very low density lipoproteins whereas both triglycerides and cholesterol were extremely low in high density lipoproteins. These lipoprotein abnormalities, reversible on successful therapy, are compatible with a depressed lipolytic activity. Post-heparin levels of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase in plasma were studied in four children and found to be markedly low during active FHL. We suggest that inflammatory cytokines, which may strongly suppress lipoprotein lipase activity, can be important mediators in the pathophysiology of FHL and that they may participate in the development of the lipid abnormalities.},

  Abstract                 = {Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a frequently missed and almost uniformly fatal childhood disorder. It is characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, coagulopathy, and hypertriglyceridemia. The pathogenesis of FHL is not known but the above clinical and laboratory findings are compatible with reported in vitro and in vivo effects of several inflammatory cytokines. We measured circulating interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor/cachectin (TNF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in nine children with FHL. During active disease, elevated IFN-gamma was detected in seven of seven children, TNF in six of six, and IL-6 in two of six children studied. Thus, important inflammatory cytokines are augmented in active FHL and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Soluble CD8 was also increased in seven of seven children, which suggests a pathophysiologic importance of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Because FHL appears to be associated with a systemic hypercytokinemia, our results also indicate that studies of FHL may contribute to the understanding of cytokine effects in vivo. Moreover, FHL is a hereditary disorder, suggesting that the hypercytokinemia is caused by a genetic defect in cytokine regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {We retrospectively studied the incidence of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) in children during the 16-year period 1971-86. First, all departments of pediatrics, pathology, and infectious diseases were enquired for children with FHL or disorders resembling FHL. Secondly, the causes of death of all children who died during the study period in Sweden (n = 19,542) were also investigated. Files and histological specimens were further studied in selected children. By using a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria, we found 32 children with FHL. The incidence was 1.2/1,000,000 children per year. One child per 50,000 live borns developed FHL during this period. The sex ratio was close to 1:1. Prominent early clinical signs were fever (91%), splenomegaly (84%), hepatomegaly (90%), rash (43%), and lymph node enlargement (42%). Neurological symptoms, which developed in 47%, could totally dominate the clinical picture and develop prior to other symptoms and signs. Common laboratory findings were pancytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated serum transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, and a moderate spinal fluid pleocytosis. Chest X-ray often revealed mostly discrete pulmonary infiltrates. FHL is an underdiagnosed disease and in only 11/32 children was diagnosis made during their lifetime. It is important to be aware of the disorder as potential therapy now exists.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an autosomal recessive disorder with very high mortality rates, mainly affecting infants and young children, which is characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and cytopenias. Of great clinical importance are the neurologic symptoms, which are common and may even dominate the clinical picture and precede the systemic presentation. These symptoms are extremely variable, ranging from irritability, bulging fontanelle, and neck stiffness, to convulsions, cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, hemiplegia/tetraplegia, and unconsciousness. METHODS: To elucidate this neurologic involvement further, we reviewed the neuropathologic postmortem findings from 23 children and their neurologic symptoms. RESULTS: Macroscopically, edema was present in many cases, and in some with advanced disease, softening and destruction of the tissue were conspicuous. The microscopic picture was exceedingly variable, ranging from almost normal to very advanced changes. In the mildest form of HLH, only the meninges were involved with infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages (stage I), whereas more advanced cases in addition also showed perivascular infiltrates (stage II). In even more advanced disease there was also a diffuse infiltration in the tissue (stage III), as well as a multifocal necrosis. A prominent astrogliosis was present in such cases. Hemophagocytosis was seen in most patients, most commonly in the leptomeninges. CONCLUSIONS: HLH affecting the central nervous system imitates several neurologic disorders and may be misdiagnosed. A staging system for the neuropathologic findings is presented. In children with obscure central nervous systems symptoms and a progressive encephalopathy, the diagnosis of HLH may be considered, in particular because treatments are available.},

  Abstract                 = {Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) comprises familial (primary) hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) and secondary HLH (SHLH), both clinically characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and cytopenia. FHL, an autosomal recessive disease invariably fatal when untreated, is associated with defective triggering of apoptosis and reduced cytotoxic activity, resulting in a widespread accumulation of T lymphocytes and activated macrophages. In 1994 the Histiocyte Society initiated a prospective international collaborative therapeutic study (HLH-94), aiming at improved survival. It combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy (etoposide, corticosteroids, cyclosporin A, and, in selected patients, intrathecal methotrexate), followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in persistent, recurring, and/or familial disease. Between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1998, 113 eligible patients aged no more than 15 years from 21 countries started HLH-94. All had either an affected sibling (n = 25) and/or fulfilled the Histiocyte Society diagnostic criteria. At a median follow-up of 3.1 years, the estimated 3-year probability of survival overall was 55% (95% confidence interval +/- 9%), and in the familial cases, 51% (+/- 20%). Twenty enrolled children were alive and off therapy for more than 12 months without BMT. For patients who received transplants (n = 65), died prior to BMT (n = 25), or were still on therapy (n = 3), the 3-year survival was 45% (+/- 10%). The 3-year probability of survival after BMT was 62% (+/- 12%). HLH-94 is very effective, allowing BMT in most patients. Survival of children with HLH has been greatly improved.},

  Abstract                 = {A method based on indirect photometric detection (IPD) in CE employing a blue LED (473 nm) as a light source and the highly absorbing (478 nm) anionic dye, Orange G, as the probe ion was developed for the sensitive analysis of inorganic and organic anions. The use of nonaqueous solvents was examined as a simple way to reduce the adsorption of the dye onto the capillary wall and to thereby improve the baseline stability. The benefits of this approach were confirmed by experiments using BGEs in methanol (MeOH) and DMSO in which superior baselines were obtained relative to those achieved using aqueous electrolyte systems. A range of commercial LEDs was tested to improve the detection performance, with a difference of 25% in sensitivity being observed between the best and worst performing LED. The final system (4 mM Orange G, 0.05% w/v hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), 20 mM triethanolamine (TEA) in pure MeOH) exhibited stable baselines and very low LODs (0.10-0.18 microM) for a test mixture comprising nine inorganic and organic anions. These values represent a two- to six-fold improvement over previous studies and the proposed method provides the most sensitive IPD method for the determination of anions using CE published to date. RSDs for ten replicates were in the ranges of 0.42-0.62% for migration time, 1.41-3.46% for peak area and 3.20-5.78% for peak height.},

Outcome according to risk category was evaluated, and although there were no significant differences in the whole cohort, or low and intermediate-risk categories, high-risk adolescent patients had a significantly worse outcome compared to that of young adults. In these high-risk patients, 5-year event free survival was 43.6% in adolescents compared to 58.7% in young adults (log-rank survival p=0.03), and the 5-year overall survival in adolescents was 66.7% compared to 84.4% in the young adults (p=0.04). Possible contributing factors to this inferior outcome in these high-risk patients were explored. The difference could not be explained in terms of differences in histological subtype (p=0.5), proportion of patients with bulky (p=0.6) or extranodal disease (p=0.6), initial treatment received (chemotherapy alone compared to combination therapy, p=0.2), or proportion proceeding to high-dose treatment after initial treatment failure (p=0.6). There was no difference in the documented number of delays, dose reductions or episodes of non-compliance during initial treatment in the two high-risk age groups. A significantly greater proportion of high-risk adolescents had primary progressive disease (PPD) [eight high-risk adolescents (33.3%) compared to two high-risk young adults (7.7%), p=0.02].},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe trends in antibiotic management for Staphylococcus aureus infections among hospitalized children from 1999 to 2008. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted by using the Pediatric Health Information Systems database to describe antibiotic treatment of inpatients with S aureus infection at 25 children's hospitals in the United States. Patients who were admitted from 1999 to 2008 with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for S aureus infection were included. Trends in the use of vancomycin, clindamycin, linezolid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefazolin, and oxacillin/nafcillin were examined for percentage use and days of therapy per 1000 patient-days. RESULTS: A total of 64813 patients had a discharge diagnosis for S aureus infection. The incidence of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) infections during this period increased 10-fold, from 2 to 21 cases per 1000 admissions, whereas the methicillin-susceptible S aureus infection rate remained stable. Among patients with S aureus infections, antibiotics that treat MRSA increased from 52% to 79% of cases, whereas those that treat only methicillin-susceptible S aureus declined from 66% to <30% of cases. Clindamycin showed the greatest increase, from 21% in 1999 to 63% in 2008. Similar trends were observed by using days of therapy per 1000 patient-days. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic prescribing patterns for the treatment of S aureus infections have changed significantly during the past decade, reflecting the emergence of community-associated MRSA. Clindamycin is now the most commonly prescribed antibiotic for S aureus infections among hospitalized children. The substantial use of clindamycin emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring of local S aureus susceptibility patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we describe the methods used to link birth and infant mortality and morbidity surveillance data sets into sibships using deterministic or multistage probabilistic linkage methods. We describe nine linked data sets: four in the United States (Georgia, Missouri, Utah and Washington State), and four elsewhere (Scotland, Norway, Israel and Western Australia). Norway and Israel use deterministic methods to link births and deaths into sibships. The deterministic linkage is usually dependent on the availability of national identification numbers. In both countries they assign these numbers at birth. Deterministic linkage is usually highly successful, and the major problem is the validation of linkages. In the United States, Western Australia and UK linkage is multistage and probabilistic. This approach is usually dependent on the calculation linkage weights from sociodemographic variables. The success rates of probabilistic methods are above 80%. Maternally-linked perinatal data open new vistas for epidemiological research. Recurrence of poor perinatal outcomes is more appropriately studied using longitudinally-linked data sets. In addition, the emergence of risk factors and the recurrence of risk factors can be studied.},

  Abstract                 = {A substantial number of patients admitted to the ICU because of an acute illness, complicated surgery, severe trauma, or burn injury will develop a de novo form of muscle weakness during the ICU stay that is referred to as "intensive care unit acquired weakness" (ICUAW). This ICUAW evoked by critical illness can be due to axonal neuropathy, primary myopathy, or both. Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms comprise microvascular, electrical, metabolic, and bioenergetic alterations, interacting in a complex way and culminating in loss of muscle strength and/or muscle atrophy. ICUAW is typically symmetrical and affects predominantly proximal limb muscles and respiratory muscles, whereas facial and ocular muscles are often spared. The main risk factors for ICUAW include high severity of illness upon admission, sepsis, multiple organ failure, prolonged immobilization, and hyperglycemia, and also older patients have a higher risk. The role of corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents remains unclear. ICUAW is diagnosed in awake and cooperative patients by bedside manual testing of muscle strength and the severity is scored by the Medical Research Council sum score. In cases of atypical clinical presentation or evolution, additional electrophysiological testing may be required for differential diagnosis. The cornerstones of prevention are aggressive treatment of sepsis, early mobilization, preventing hyperglycemia with insulin, and avoiding the use parenteral nutrition during the first week of critical illness. Weak patients clearly have worse acute outcomes and consume more healthcare resources. Recovery usually occurs within weeks or months, although it may be incomplete with weakness persisting up to 2 years after ICU discharge. Prognosis appears compromised when the cause of ICUAW involves critical illness polyneuropathy, whereas isolated critical illness myopathy may have a better prognosis. In addition, ICUAW has shown to contribute to the risk of 1-year mortality. Future research should focus on new preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for this detrimental complication of critical illness and on clarifying how ICUAW contributes to poor longer-term prognosis.},

The difference between association and causation is described-the redundant expression "causal effect" is used throughout the article to avoid confusion with a common use of "effect" meaning simply statistical association-and shows why, in theory, randomisation allows the estimation of causal effects without further assumptions. The article concludes with a discussion on the limitations of randomised studies. These limitations are the reason why methods for causal inference from observational data are needed.},

However, observational research is often the only alternative for causal inference. This article reviews a condition that permits the estimation of causal effects from observational data, and two methods -- standardisation and inverse probability weighting -- to estimate population causal effects under that condition.

We review the definition of an instrumental variable, describe the conditions required to obtain consistent estimates of causal effects, and explore their implications in the context of a recent application of the instrumental variables approach. We also present (1) a description of the connection between 4 causal models-counterfactuals, causal directed acyclic graphs, nonparametric structural equation models, and linear structural equation models-that have been used to describe instrumental variables methods; (2) a unified presentation of IV methods for the average causal effect in the study population through structural mean models; and (3) a discussion and new extensions of instrumental variables methods based on assumptions of monotonicity.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The clinical effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in older patients with heart failure has not been established, and older patients have been underrepresented in previous studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified patients with heart failure who were aged 65 years or older and were eligible for an ICD, had left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less, and were discharged alive from hospitals participating in the Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure and the Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure quality-improvement programs during the period January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2006. We matched the patients to Medicare claims to examine long-term outcomes. The main outcome measure was all-cause mortality over 3 years. The study population included 4685 patients who were discharged alive and were eligible for an ICD. Mean age was 75.2 years, 60% of the patients were women, mean ejection fraction was 25%, and 376 (8.0%) patients received an ICD before discharge. Mortality was significantly lower among patients who received an ICD compared with those who did not (19.8% versus 27.6% at 1 year, 30.9% versus 41.9% at 2 years, and 38.1% versus 52.3% at 3 years; P<0.001 for all comparisons). The inverse probability-weighted adjusted hazard of mortality at 3 years for patients receiving an ICD was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less who were selected for ICD therapy had lower risk-adjusted long-term mortality compared with those who did not receive an ICD.

Leading causes of infant, neonatal, and postneonatal death are also presented. This report supplements the annual report of final mortality statistics. METHODS: Data in this report are based on information from all death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia in 2003. Causes of death classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to rankable causes. RESULTS: In 2003, the 10 leading causes of death were (in rank order): Diseases of heart; Malignant neoplasms; Cerebrovascular diseases; Chronic lower respiratory diseases; Accidents (unintentional injuries); Diabetes mellitus; Influenza and pneumonia; Alzheimer's disease; Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis; and Septicemia and accounted for about 78 percent of all deaths occurring in the United States. Differences in the ranking are evident by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. Leading causes of infant death for 2003 were (in rank order): Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities; Disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, not elsewhere classified; Sudden infant death syndrome; Newborn affected by maternal complications of pregnancy; Newborn affected by complications of placenta, cord and membranes; Accidents (unintentional injuries); Respiratory distress of newborn; Bacterial sepsis of newborn; Neonatal hemorrhage; and Diseases of the circulatory system. Important variation in the leading causes of infant death is noted for the neonatal and postneonatal periods.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: There have been few detailed, in-person interviews and examinations to obtain follow-up data on 5-year outcomes among survivors of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: We evaluated 109 survivors of ARDS at 3, 6, and 12 months and at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after discharge from the intensive care unit. At each visit, patients were interviewed and examined; underwent pulmonary-function tests, the 6-minute walk test, resting and exercise oximetry, chest imaging, and a quality-of-life evaluation; and reported their use of health care services. RESULTS: At 5 years, the median 6-minute walk distance was 436 m (76% of predicted distance) and the Physical Component Score on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey was 41 (mean norm score matched for age and sex, 50). With respect to this score, younger patients had a greater rate of recovery than older patients, but neither group returned to normal predicted levels of physical function at 5 years. Pulmonary function was normal to near-normal. A constellation of other physical and psychological problems developed or persisted in patients and family caregivers for up to 5 years. Patients with more coexisting illnesses incurred greater 5-year costs. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise limitation, physical and psychological sequelae, decreased physical quality of life, and increased costs and use of health care services are important legacies of severe lung injury.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Little is known about the transfer of care process from pediatric to adult rheumatology for patients with chronic rheumatic disease. The purpose of this study is to examine changes in disease status, treatment and health care utilization among adolescents transferring to adult care at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). METHODS: We identified 31 eligible subjects who transferred from pediatric to adult rheumatology care at UCSF between 1995-2005. Subject demographics, disease characteristics, disease activity and health care utilization were compared between the year prior to and the year following transfer of care. RESULTS: The mean age at the last pediatric rheumatology visit was 19.5 years (17.4-22.0). Subject diagnoses included systemic lupus erythematosus (52%), mixed connective tissue disease (16%), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (16%), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (13%) and vasculitis (3%). Nearly 30% of subjects were hospitalized for disease treatment or management of flares in the year prior to transfer, and 58% had active disease at the time of transfer. In the post-transfer period, almost 30% of subjects had an increase in disease activity. One patient died in the post-transfer period. The median transfer time between the last pediatric and first adult rheumatology visit was 7.1 months (range 0.7-33.6 months). Missed appointments were common in the both the pre and post transfer period. CONCLUSION: A significant percentage of patients who transfer from pediatric to adult rheumatology care at our center are likely to have active disease at the time of transfer, and disease flares are common during the transfer period. These findings highlight the importance of a seamless transfer of care between rheumatology providers.},

  Abstract                 = {To evaluate the attributable morbidity and mortality of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, we conducted a prospective, matched cohort study. Patients expected to be ventilated for > 48 h were prospectively followed for the development of VAP. To determine the excess ICU stay and mortality attributable to VAP, we matched patients with VAP to patients who did not develop clinically suspected pneumonia. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of different populations, onset of pneumonia, diagnostic criteria, causative organisms, and adequacy of empiric treatment on the outcome of VAP. One hundred and seventy-seven patients developed VAP. As compared with matched patients who did not develop VAP, patients with VAP stayed in the ICU for 4.3 d (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5 to 7. 0 d) longer and had a trend toward an increase in risk of death (absolute risk increase: 5.8%; 95% CI: -2.4 to 14.0 d; relative risk (RR) increase: 32.3%; 95% CI: -20.6 to 85.1%). The attributable ICU length of stay was longer for medical than for surgical patients (6. 5 versus 0.7 d, p < 0.004), and for patients infected with "high risk" organisms as compared with "low risk" organisms (9.1 d versus 2.9 d). The attributable mortality was higher for medical patients than for surgical patients (RR increase of 65% versus -27.3%, p = 0. 04). Results were similar for three different VAP diagnostic criteria. We conclude that VAP prolongs ICU length of stay and may increase the risk of death in critically ill patients. The attributable risk of VAP appears to vary with patient population and infecting organism.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Imported malaria remains a public health concern in the United States, but the health impact on children and the financial costs to society have not been well defined. METHODS: Inpatient and outpatient malaria cases diagnosed at Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) in Washington, DC over an 8-year period are retrospectively reviewed. Cases are mapped against Census Bureau population data. These observations are compared with the national burden of pediatric malaria, including both disease severity and cost, by reviewing inpatient malaria cases in the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), January 2003 to June 2008. RESULTS: At CNMC, malaria most commonly affects children who traveled to West Africa to visit friends and relatives. Poor adherence to prophylaxis and self-treatment with antimalarial medications were commonly identified. Mapping demonstrates case clustering in communities with large sub-Saharan African populations. The cumulative incidence (CI) of malaria at CNMC of 9.0 per 10,000 admissions is 7.6 times the national average. The CI of malaria at PHIS hospitals is 1.2 per 10,000 admissions with an average cost of $17,519. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria is a preventable disease for which the risk to life and costs of treatment are significant. Patterns of risk can be used by health planners to target prevention strategies at the community level. In regions with a high density of immigrants, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa, physicians must be aware of the risk, understand recommended prophylaxis and treatment regimens, and advocate for their appropriate use in the community.},

  Abstract                 = {Intrauterine constraint is responsible for a number of structural defects of the craniofacial and peripheral skeleton including plagiocephaly, micrognathia, congenital hip dislocation, and talipes equinovarus. This report describes five infants with serious craniofacial alterations, all attributable to intrauterine constraint. All five children had clinical and laboratory evidence strongly suggestive of craniosynostosis. In three of the five, sutural fusion was documented either at operation or at necropsy. In the other two the clinical course indicated that true synostosis was not present. In all cases the sutural involvement corresponded to the dimension in which head growth had been restricted. This determaination was based upon an assessment of the other craniofacial alterations that were present. The etiology of the intrauterine constrain was different in each case. Factors involved included breech presentation, primagravidity, uterine malformations, amniotic bands, and defects in fetal neuromuscular development, all of which are known to produce fetal deformations. As further evidence of severe constraint, fetal activity was greatly reduced during four of the five pregnancies. There was no history of craniosynostosis in other family members. We propose that in utero compression may lead to a spectrum of craniofacial defects that includes craniosynostosis when the constraint is particularly prolonged. The data suggest that mechanical forces may play a role in the etiology of some cases of craniosynostosis. The fact that head shape spontaneously remolded in one of the five cases suggests further that surgical correction may not be required in all cases in which constraint is the suspected etiology of the deformation.

  Abstract                 = {Alcohol consumption is a strong risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). The genetic polymorphisms aldehyde dehydrogenase2 (ALDH2) Glu487Lys and alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ADH2) His47Arg, which have a strong impact on alcohol metabolism, are common in the Japanese population. To clarify the significance of these polymorphisms in SCCHN carcinogenesis, we conducted a matched case-control study with 239 incident SCCHN subjects and 716 non-cancer controls. Both ADH2 Arg/Arg and ALDH2 Glu/Lys were found to be independently associated with increased risk, with odds ratios (OR) of 2.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51-4.57) and 1.66 (95% CI 1.20-2.31), respectively. Further, compared with subjects having both ADH2 His/His and ALDH2 Glu/Glu, the adjusted OR and its 95% CI for those with both ADH2 Arg/Arg and ALDH2 Glu/Lys was 5.00 (2.32-10.71) in all subjects. This combination effect was evident in heavy drinkers (OR 11.3, 95% CI 2.97-43.3) but not in moderate or non-drinkers. Statistically significant gene-environment interactions between the two polymorphisms and drinking level were seen (ADH2 P = 0.035, ALDH2, P = 0.013). Furthermore, we also found a statistically significant gene-gene interaction between the two polymorphisms (P = 0.042). In conclusion, this case-control study showed a significantly increased risk of SCCHN in subjects with the ADH2 Arg/Arg and ALDH2 Glu/Lys polymorphisms in a Japanese population. In addition, our results also demonstrated that this risk was associated with significant gene-gene interactions between ADH2 and ALDH2 polymorphisms, as well as gene-environment interactions between these polymorphisms and alcohol drinking.},

  Abstract                 = {Coffee has become a popular beverage worldwide. Caffeine, a major ingredient of coffee, has been proposed to have a favorable affect on the modulation of circulating estrogen levels and therefore may be of importance in developments on hormone-related cancers. However, epidemiological evidence is limited and inconsistent. We examined the relationship between intake of coffee and hormone-related cancer risk among Japanese women using data from the hospital-based epidemiological research program at Aichi Cancer Center (HERPACC). In total, 2122 breast, 229 endometrial and 166 ovarian cancer cases were included, and 12 425 women, confirmed as free of cancer, were recruited as the control group. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis. A statistically significant inverse association between risk of endometrial cancer and coffee consumption was noted in Japanese women, with no clear association evident for breast and ovarian cancer risk. Compared to non-drinker, the OR of daily drinking of 1-2 cups and 3 or more cups per day for endometrial cancer were 0.64 (95% CI: 0.43-0.94) and 0.41 (95% CI: 0.19-0.87), respectively, and the linear trend was also statistically significant (P < 0.01). However, there was no statistically significant association between caffeine intake and endometrial cancer. In summary, the results of the present study suggest that coffee consumption reduces the risk of endometrial cancer in Japanese subjects. Given the scarcity of studies of coffee intake and endometrial cancer and other hormone-dependent cancer risk, additional investigations are warranted.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Because clinicians fear missing occult cervical-spine injuries, they obtain cervical radiographs for nearly all patients who present with blunt trauma. Previous research suggests that a set of clinical criteria (decision instrument) can identify patients who have an extremely low probability of injury and who consequently have no need for imaging studies. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study of such a decision instrument at 21 centers across the United States. The decision instrument required patients to meet five criteria in order to be classified as having a low probability of injury: no midline cervical tenderness, no focal neurologic deficit, normal alertness, no intoxication, and no painful, distracting injury. We examined the performance of the decision rule in 34,069 patients who underwent radiography of the cervical spine after blunt trauma. RESULTS: The decision instrument identified all but 8 of the 818 patients who had cervical-spine injury (sensitivity, 99.0 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 98.0 to 99.6 percent]). The negative predictive value was 99.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 99.6 to 100 percent), the specificity was 12.9 percent, and the positive predictive value was 2.7 percent. Only two of the patients classified as unlikely to have an injury according to the decision instrument met the preset definition of a clinically significant injury (sensitivity, 99.6 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 98.6 to 100 percent]; negative predictive value, 99.9 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 99.8 to 100 percent]; specificity, 12.9 percent; positive predictive value, 1.9 percent), and only one of these two patients received surgical treatment. According to the results of assessment with the decision instrument, radiographic imaging could have been avoided in the cases of 4309 (12.6 percent) of the 34,069 evaluated patients. CONCLUSIONS: A simple decision instrument based on clinical criteria can help physicians to identify reliably the patients who need radiography of the cervical spine after blunt trauma. Application of this instrument could reduce the use of imaging in such patients.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Many pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass have a predictable fall in the cardiac index 6 to 18 hours after surgery, the so-called low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS). Because patients who have LCOS require more monitoring and support and have a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit, the syndrome is associated with a costly morbidity. Milrinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, improves cardiac muscle contractile force and vascular muscle relaxation through positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects. The purpose of the Prophylactic Intravenous Use of Milrinone After Cardiac Operation in Pediatrics (PRIMACORP) study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the prophylactic use of milrinone in pediatric patients at high risk for development of LCOS after undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: Patients in the multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel treatment study will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: (1) low-dose milrinone (25 microg/kg intravenous bolus over 60 minutes followed by a 0.25 microg/kg/min infusion for 35 hours), (2) high-dose milrinone (75 microg/kg intravenous bolus over 60 minutes followed by a 0.75 microg/kg/min infusion for 35 hours), or (3) placebo. RESULTS: The primary end point for efficacy evaluation will be based on a composite variable consisting of death or development of LCOS requiring additional mechanical or pharmacologic support, up to 36 hours after randomization. A 2-sided test with a 0.025 type I error will be used for the primary end point analysis. The PRIMACORP study will enroll a total of 240 patients. Six additional secondary end points will be analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The PRIMACORP study will address several questions regarding the safety and efficacy of prophylactic milrinone use in pediatric patients at high risk for development of LCOS after cardiac surgery.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose was to assess differences in neonatal morbidity and mortality between maternally transferred, neonatally transferred and inborn neonates. We evaluated a continuous series of all antenatal transported infants (ATI, n=247) and postnatal transported infants (PTI, n=34) to the NICU and all preterm inborns (NTI, n=120) delivered at the University Hospital of Vienna. Data collected included sociodemographic, obstetrical and neonatal data. Mild neonatal morbidity was defined as RDS, BPD, ROP, PDA, NEC or IVH I-II, whereas severe neonatal morbidity was defined as the presence of PVL or IVH III-IV. Data were analyzed statistically using the Spearman correlation Coefficient, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and a multivariate model. There was a substantial gain in gestational age from transfer to delivery in the ATI group and from admission to delivery in the NTI group (2.1 and 5.6 weeks, respectively). The neonatal survival rate was 88.7% in the ATI and 97.5% in the NTI group. No neonate died in the PTI group; there was a significantly higher percentage of severe neonatal morbidity than in the ATI group (11.8% vs. 4.9%). We could not observe a significant difference with respect to the risk of death among the three study groups. There was a strong trend towards higher probability of severe neonatal morbidity in the NTI group. The risk of severe neonatal morbidity is much higher in the PTI-group (rel. risk 0.19, 0.06). Antenatal transfer guaranteed a significantly better neonatal outcome concerning severe neonatal morbidity than postnatal transport, and compared favorably with inborn admissions, even given the higher gestational age and birth weight in the NTI-group.},

  Abstract                 = {Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), an adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been characterized as a putative tumor suppressor because it is frequently down-regulated in aggressive types of cancer cells. Recently, however, several studies have shown that CEACAM1 actively contributes to malignant progression or migration in some types of tumor cells, suggesting that the role of CEACAM1 might be diverse among different types of cancer cells. To investigate the functional consequences of CEACAM1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma, we analyzed the status of CEACAM1 in hepatoma cell lines HLF, PLC/PRF/5, HepG2 and KYN-2. We found that CEACAM1 was only expressed in HepG2 cells, which show a unique property for enhanced anchorage-independent growth. When HepG2 cells were treated with small interfering RNA targeted against CEACAM1, the growth rate in monolayer culture was increased. In contrast, when HepG2 cells were cultured in suspension, inhibition of CEACAM1 expression significantly decreased the growth rate, and the speed of cell-cell attachment was repressed. Hyaluronidase treatment attenuated the growth rate of HepG2 cells in suspension culture, indicating that cell-cell attachment is a requisite for anchorage-independent growth. Our data may reveal the dual role of CEACAM1 on hepatocarcinogenesis, by showing that CEACAM1 acts as a tumor suppressor in HepG2 cells in anchorage-dependent growth conditions, while in anchorage-independent growth conditions, it augments cell proliferation by potentiating the cell-cell attachment.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Black patients with peripheral arterial disease undergo amputation at two to four times the rate of white patients. In order to determine whether differences in attempts at limb salvage might contribute to this disparity, we studied the limb care received prior to amputation by black patients compared with whites. METHODS: Using inpatient Medicare data for the years 2003 through 2006, we identified a retrospective sample of all beneficiaries who underwent major lower extremity amputation. "Limb salvage care" was defined as limb-related admissions and procedures that occurred during the 2 years prior to amputation. We used multiple logistic regression to compare rates of revascularization and other limb care received by black versus white amputees, adjusting for individual patient characteristics. We then controlled for hospital referral region in order to assess whether differences in care might be attributable to the geographic regions in which black and white patients received care. Finally, we examined the timing of revascularization relative to amputation for both races. RESULTS: Our sample included 24,600 black and 65,881 white amputees. Compared with whites, black amputees were more likely to be female and had lower socioeconomic status. Average age, rates of diabetes, and levels of comorbidity were similar between races. Black amputees were significantly less likely than whites to have undergone revascularization (23.6% vs 31.6%; P < .0001), any limb-related admission (39.6% vs 44.7%; P < .0001), toe amputation (12.9% vs 13.8%; P < .0005), or wound debridement (11.6% vs 14.2%; P < .0001) prior to amputation. After adjusting for differences in individual patient characteristics, black amputees remained significantly less likely than whites to undergo revascularization (odds ratios [OR], 0.72 [95% confidence interval, .68-.76]), limb-related admission (OR, 0.81 [0.78-0.84]), or wound debridement prior to amputation (OR, 0.80 [0.75-0.85]). Timing of revascularization relative to amputation was similar between races. Observed differences in care were shown to exist within hospital referral regions and were not accounted for by regional differences in where black and white patients received care. CONCLUSION: Black patients are much less likely than whites to undergo attempts at limb salvage prior to amputation. Further studies should explore whether this disparity might be attributable to race-related differences in severity of arterial disease, patient preferences, or physician decision making.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Enrolling children in research studies in the emergency department (ED) is typically dependent on the presence of a guardian to provide written informed consent. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to determine the rate of guardian availability during the initial ED evaluation of children with nontrivial blunt head trauma, to identify the reasons why a guardian is unavailable, and to compare clinical factors in patients with and without a guardian present during initial ED evaluation. METHODS: This was a prospective study of children (<18 years of age) presenting to a single Level 1 trauma center after nontrivial blunt head trauma over a 10-month period. Physicians documented patient history and physical examination findings onto a structured data form after initial evaluation. The data form contained data points regarding the presence or absence of the patient's guardian during the initial ED evaluation. For those children for whom the guardian was not available during the initial ED evaluation, the physicians completing the data forms documented the reasons for the absence. RESULTS: The authors enrolled 602 patients, of whom 271 (45%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 41% to 49%) did not have a guardian available during the initial ED evaluation. In these 271 patients, 261 had reasons documented for lack of guardian availability, 43 of whom had multiple reasons. The most common of these was that the guardian did not ride in the ambulance (51%). Those patients without a guardian available were more likely to be older (mean age, 11.4 years vs. 7.6 years; p < 0.001), be victims of a motor vehicle collision (MVC; 130/268 [49%] vs. 35/328 [11%]; p < 0.001), have a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score <14 (21/269 [7.8%] vs. 11/331 [3.3%]; p = 0.02), and undergo cranial computed tomography (CT) scanning (224/271 [83%] vs. 213/331 [64%]; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified similar independent risk factors for lack of guardian presence. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-half of children with nontrivial blunt head trauma evaluated in the ED may not have a guardian available during their initial ED evaluation. Patients whose guardians are not available at the time of initial ED evaluation are older and have more severe mechanisms of injury and more serious head trauma. ED research studies of pediatric trauma patients that require written informed consent from a guardian at the time of initial ED evaluation and treatment may have difficulty enrolling targeted sample size numbers and will likely be limited by enrollment bias.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: We validate the accuracy of a previously derived clinical prediction rule for the identification of children with intra-abdominal injuries after blunt torso trauma. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of children with blunt torso trauma who were evaluated for intra-abdominal injury with abdominal computed tomography (CT), diagnostic laparoscopy, or laparotomy at a Level I trauma center during a 3-year period to validate a previously derived prediction rule. The emergency physician providing care documented history and physical examination findings on a standardized data collection form before knowledge of the results of diagnostic imaging. The clinical prediction rule being evaluated included 6 "high-risk" variables, the presence of any of which indicated that the child was not at low risk for intra-abdominal injury: low age-adjusted systolic blood pressure, abdominal tenderness, femur fracture, increased liver enzyme levels (serum aspartate aminotransferase concentration >200 U/L or serum alanine aminotransferase concentration >125 U/L), microscopic hematuria (urinalysis >5 RBCs/high powered field), or an initial hematocrit level less than 30%. RESULTS: One thousand three hundred twenty-four children with blunt torso trauma were enrolled, and 1,119 (85%) patients had the variables in the decision rule documented by the emergency physician and therefore made up the study sample. The prediction rule had the following test characteristics: sensitivity=149 of 157, 94.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.2% to 97.7%) and specificity=357 of 962, 37.1% (95% CI 34.0 to 40.3%). Three hundred sixty-five patients tested negative for the rule; thus, strict application would have resulted in a 33% reduction in abdominal CT scanning. Of the 8 patients with intra-abdominal injury not identified by the prediction rule, 1 underwent a laparotomy. This patient had a serosal tear and a mesenteric hematoma at laparotomy, neither of which required specific surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: A clinical prediction rule consisting of 6 variables, easily available to clinicians in the ED, identifies most but not all children with intra-abdominal injury. Application of the prediction rule to this sample would have reduced the number of unnecessary abdominal CT scans performed but would have failed to identify 1 child undergoing (a nontherapeutic) laparotomy. Thus, further refinement of this prediction rule in a large, multicenter cohort is necessary before widespread implementation.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: We derive and validate clinical prediction rules to identify adult patients at very low risk for intra-abdominal injuries after blunt torso trauma. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled adult patients (>or=18 years old) after blunt torso trauma for whom diagnostic testing for intra-abdominal injury was performed. In the derivation phase, we used binary recursive partitioning to create a rule to identify patients with intra-abdominal injury who were undergoing acute intervention (including therapeutic laparotomy or angiographic embolization) and a separate rule for identifying patients with any intra-abdominal injury present. We considered only clinical variables readily available with acceptable interrater reliability. The prediction rules were then prospectively validated in a separate cohort of patients. RESULTS: In the derivation phase, we enrolled 3,435 patients, including 311 (9.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.1% to 10.1%) with intra-abdominal injury and 109 (35.0%; 95% CI 29.7% to 40.6%) with intra-abdominal injury requiring acute intervention. In the validation study, we enrolled 1,595 patients, including 143 (9.0%; 95% CI 7.6% to 10.5%) with intra-abdominal injury. The derived rule for patients with intra-abdominal injuries who were undergoing acute intervention consisted of hypotension, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score less than 14, costal margin tenderness, abdominal tenderness, hematuria level greater than or equal to 25 red blood cells/high powered field, and hematocrit level less than 30% and identified all 44 patients in the validation phase with intra-abdominal injury who were undergoing acute intervention (sensitivity 44/44, 100%; 95% CI 93.4% to 100%). The derived rule for the presence of any intra-abdominal injury consisted of GCS score less than 14, costal margin tenderness, abdominal tenderness, femur fracture, hematuria level greater than or equal to 25 red blood cells/high powered field, hematocrit level less than 30%, and abnormal chest radiograph result (pneumothorax or rib fracture). In the validation phase, the rule for any intra-abdominal injury present had the following test performance: sensitivity 137 of 143 (95.8%; 95% CI 91.1% to 98.4%), specificity 434 of 1,452 (29.9%; 95% CI 27.5% to 32.3%), and negative predictive value 434 of 440 (98.6%; 95% CI 97.1% to 99.5%). CONCLUSION: These derived and validated clinical prediction rules can aid physicians in the evaluation of adult patients after blunt torso trauma. Patients without any of these variables are at very low risk for having intra-abdominal injury, particularly intra-abdominal injury requiring acute intervention, and are unlikely to benefit from abdominal computed tomography scanning.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Nonoperative management (NOM) is the accepted treatment of most pediatric solid organ injuries (SOI) and, is typically successful. We sought to elucidate predictors of, and the time course to, failure in the subset of children suffering SOI who required operative intervention. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed from January 1997 through December 2002 of all pediatric patients (age 0-20 years) with a SOI (liver, spleen, kidney, pancreas) from the trauma registries of seven designated, level I pediatric trauma centers. Failure of NOM was defined as the need for intra-abdominal operative intervention. Data reviewed included demographics, injury mechanism, injury severity (ISS, AIS, SOI grade, and GCS), and outcome. For the failures of NOM, time to operation and relevant clinical variables were also abstracted. A summary AIS (sAIS) was calculated for each patient by summing the AIS values for each SOI, to account for multiple SOI in the same patient. Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed, and significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 1,880 children were identified. Of these, 62 sustained nonsurvivable head injuries that precluded assessment of NOM outcome and were thus excluded. The remaining 1,818 patients comprised the overall study population. There were 1,729 successful NOM patients (controls -- C) and 89 failures (F), for an overall NOM failure rate of 5%. For isolated organ injuries, the failure rates were: kidney 3%, liver 3%, spleen 4%, and pancreas 18%. There were 14 deaths in the failure group from nonsalvageable injuries (mean ISS = 54 +/- 15). The two groups did not differ with respect to mean age or gender. An MVC was the most common injury mechanism in both groups. Only bicycle crashes were associated with a significantly increased risk of failing NOM (RR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.02-3.04, p < 0.05). Injury severity and organ specific injuries were associated with NOM failure. When controlling for ISS and GCS, multivariate regression analysis confirmed that a sAIS > or = 4, isolated pancreatic injury, and >1 organ injured were significantly associated with NOM failure (p < 0.01). The median time to failure was 3 hours (range, 0.5-144 hours) with 38% having failed by 2 hours, 59% by 4 hours, and 76% by 12 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Failure of NOM is un common (5%) and typically occurs within the first 12 hours after injury. Failure is associated with injury severity and multiplicity, as well as isolated pancreatic injuries.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: There is a commonly held belief that randomized, placebo-controlled trials in pediatric critical care should incorporate "rescue" therapy (open-label administration of active drug) when a child's condition is deteriorating. The ethical, conceptual, and analytic challenges related to rescue therapy in randomized trials can be misrepresented. DESIGN: Narrative review. METHODS: The ethical basis of rescue therapy, the equipoise concept, and intention-to-treat analysis are examined in the setting of a hypothetical randomized trial comparing corticosteroids vs. placebo in pediatric septic shock. FINDINGS: The perceived need for rescue therapy may be partly motivated by the moral imperative to save a child's life. However, allowing rescue therapy in a trial is misconceived and inconsistent with equipoise regarding the efficacy of the study drug. If rescue therapy is permitted, intention-to-treat analysis can only compare immediate vs. delayed use of the study drug. When rescue therapy is beneficial, the observed treatment effect is substantially diminished from true effect of the study drug, leading to increased sample size and thereby placing more children at risk (18 "excess" placebo-arm deaths occur in our hypothetical example). Analysis of a trial incorporating rescue therapy cannot definitively assess overall efficacy of the agent, or distinguish beneficial or harmful treatment effects related to timing of drug use. CONCLUSIONS: Although a rescue therapy component in a randomized trial may be perceived as ethically desirable, inconsistency of rescue therapy with full equipoise may itself raise significant ethical concerns. Increased sample sizes expose more children to the risks of study participation, including death. Researchers should be aware that clinical trials designed with rescue therapy cannot definitively determine the beneficial or harmful effects of a treatment per se, and can only assess the effects of delayed vs. immediate provision of the treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Limited multicenter data exist regarding the prevalence of postoperative complications after the Norwood operation and their associated mortality risk. METHODS: We evaluated infants in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database who underwent the Norwood operation from 2000 to 2009. The prevalence of postoperative complications after the Norwood operation and associated in-hospital mortality were described. Patient factors associated with complications were evaluated in multivariable analyses. RESULTS: A total of 2,557 patients from 53 centers were included. Median age at operation was 6 days (interquartile range, 4 to 9 days) and 90% had a right dominant ventricle. Overall mortality was 22%, and 75% had 1 complication or more. Mortality increased with increasing number of complications: 1 complication, 17%; 2 complications, 21%; 3 complications, 26%; 4 complications, 33%; and 5 or more complications, 45%. Renal and cardiovascular complications carried the greatest mortality risk. Patient factors associated with 1 complication or more included weight less than 2.5 kg (odds ratio [OR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 2.1), single right versus single left ventricle (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.0), preoperative shock (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.1), non-cardiac/genetic abnormality (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9), and preoperative mechanical ventilatory (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.6) or circulatory (OR 4.0; 95%CI, 1.6 to 10.2) support. CONCLUSIONS: Complications after the Norwood operation are common, carry significant mortality risk, and are associated with several preoperative patient characteristics. These data may aid in providing prognostic information to families and in guiding quality improvement initiatives.},

  Abstract                 = {The time course of biochemical changes related to cell loss and damage during exposure to 95% O2 [DNA and protein content of dishes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release] was studied in postconfluent endothelial cells isolated from pig aorta, cultured in standard medium and in medium supplemented with 2 X 10(-7) M selenomethionine (Se-Met). A fourfold increase in glutathione peroxidase (G-Px) was the only major enzymatic Se-related effect under both normoxic and hyperoxic conditions, the other antioxidant enzymes being little or not at all affected by this treatment. The addition of Se-Met had a clearcut protective action against the cytotoxic effect of O2 as shown by measurements of DNA and protein content of Petri dishes and of LDH release. On the other hand, the most sensitive O2-related effect, namely the decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, was not affected by Se-Met addition. These experiments suggest that some of the O2-related toxic effects (but not the inhibition of DNA synthesis) could be mediated by lipid peroxides, since they were, at least partly, prevented by a Se-Met-induced increase in G-Px activity.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of ventilator-associated pneumonia on resource utilization, morbidity, and mortality. DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study based on prospectively collected data. SETTING: Medical intensive care unit of a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Case-patients were all patients receiving mechanical ventilation for 48 hours or more who experienced an episode of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Control-patients were matched for number of discharge diagnoses, duration of mechanical support before the onset of pneumonia among case-patients, age, admission diagnosis, gender, and study period. RESULTS: One hundred six cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia were identified in 452 patients receiving mechanical ventilation. The matching procedure selected 97 pairs. Length of stay in the intensive care unit and duration of mechanical ventilation were greater among case-patients by a mean of 7.2 days (P< .001) and 5.1 days (P< .001), respectively. Median costs were $24,727 (interquartile range, $18,348 to $39,703) among case-patients and $17,438 (interquartile range, $12,261 to $24,226) among control-patients (P < .001). The attributable mortality rate was 7.3% (P = .26). The attributable extra hospital stay was 10 days with an extra cost of $15,986 per episode of pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Ventilator-associated pneumonia negatively affects patient outcome and represents a significant burden on intensive care unit and hospital resources.},

  Abstract                 = {With a limited supply of donor hearts, individuals with end-stage heart failure have been offered hope through the use of mechanical devices. Left ventricular-assist devices (LVADs) are a technology designed to work in parallel with the heart but have yet to see widespread use since uncertainty remains as to the cost-effectiveness of this evolving new technology. We have systematically reviewed evidence of cost-effectiveness for LVADs in the bridge-to-transplant and long-term chronic support indications. A total of 18 studies reporting costs were identified. Of these, only four studies reported results in cost-effectiveness terms; two in cost per life-year saved and two in cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The majority of the other studies were simple cost summations (cost per day or incremental cost) without consideration of efficacy. In the bridge-to-transplant indication, a Danish abstract reported a cost per life-year saved of DKK270k (US$48,000), a UK study reported a cost per QALY of GB pound39,787 (US$78,000) and a Canadian study reported a cost per life-year saved of Can$91,332 (US$86,000). Regarding the long-term chronic support indication, the same Canadian study reported a cost per life-year saved of Can$59,842 (US$56,000), whereas a US study reported a cost per QALY of $36,255-60,057. Assuming a willingness to pay the threshold of GB pound30,000 (US$59,000) per QALY, there is arguably stronger evidence to support the cost-effectiveness of LVAD technology for the long-term chronic support indication. However, the methodological quality of the majority of studies was poor, as was their generalizability, raising concerns over the reliability of these figures. With the limited and declining availability of donor hearts for transplantation, it appears that the future of this technology is in its use as long-term chronic support. Further analyses should be undertaken, particularly alongside randomized, controlled trials and utilizing second- and third-generation devices.},

We also determined the association between these physiologic insults and unfavorable outcome using regression analysis. There were more patients with episodes of hypotension or low cerebral perfusion pressure in the hypothermia therapy group than in the normothermia group. These physiologic insults were associated with unfavorable outcome in both intervention groups.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Hypothermia therapy improves survival and the neurologic outcome in animal models of traumatic brain injury. However, the effect of hypothermia therapy on the neurologic outcome and mortality among children who have severe traumatic brain injury is unknown. METHODS: In a multicenter, international trial, we randomly assigned children with severe traumatic brain injury to either hypothermia therapy (32.5 degrees C for 24 hours) initiated within 8 hours after injury or to normothermia (37.0 degrees C). The primary outcome was the proportion of children who had an unfavorable outcome (i.e., severe disability, persistent vegetative state, or death), as assessed on the basis of the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score at 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 225 children were randomly assigned to the hypothermia group or the normothermia group; the mean temperatures achieved in the two groups were 33.1+/-1.2 degrees C and 36.9+/-0.5 degrees C, respectively. At 6 months, 31% of the patients in the hypothermia group, as compared with 22% of the patients in the normothermia group, had an unfavorable outcome (relative risk, 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 2.22; P=0.14). There were 23 deaths (21%) in the hypothermia group and 14 deaths (12%) in the normothermia group (relative risk, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.90 to 2.27; P=0.06). There was more hypotension (P=0.047) and more vasoactive agents were administered (P<0.001) in the hypothermia group during the rewarming period than in the normothermia group. Lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital and other adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In children with severe traumatic brain injury, hypothermia therapy that is initiated within 8 hours after injury and continued for 24 hours does not improve the neurologic outcome and may increase mortality.

Average annual rates were computed for rural and urban children, separately by gender. The 1980 census was used to compute rates. Rate ratios were calculated to summarize information related to specific external causes of deaths, contrasting rural and urban children. These differences were evaluated using Z tests.Statistically significant elevated risks were found along rural children for motor vehicle injury deaths. Firearms were involved more often in rural deaths among unintentional injury deaths of children older than 4 years of age, and among homicide related deaths of children 5 years and younger. All rural children who committed suicide used a firearm.Comparisons between rural and urban injury deaths provide important information that can be used to guide prevention strategies. For example, in Colorado, a child restraint law, passed in 1984, covered children under 4 years of age or under 40 pounds. It was not until 1995, however, that legislation was passed requiring restraint of children 5-16 years of age. Traditionally, rural residents are slower to accept new ideas and to alter current practices than urban residents.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: This report describes the case mix and outcome (mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay) for admissions to ICU for head injury and evaluates the predictive ability of five risk adjustment models. METHODS: A secondary analysis was conducted of data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) Case Mix Programme, a high quality clinical database, of 374,594 admissions to 171 adult critical care units across England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 1995 to 2005. The discrimination and calibration of five risk prediction models, SAPS II, MPM II, APACHE II and III and the ICNARC model plus raw Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) were compared. RESULTS: There were 11,021 admissions following traumatic brain injury identified (3% of all database admissions). Mortality in ICU was 23.5% and in-hospital was 33.5%. Median ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 3.2 and 24 days, respectively, for survivors and 1.6 and 3 days, respectively, for non-survivors. The ICNARC model, SAPS II and MPM II discriminated best between survivors and non-survivors and were better calibrated than raw GCS, APACHE II and III in 5,393 patients eligible for all models. CONCLUSION: Traumatic brain injury requiring intensive care has a high mortality rate. Non-survivors have a short length of ICU and hospital stay. APACHE II and III have poorer calibration and discrimination than SAPS II, MPM II and the ICNARC model in traumatic brain injury; however, no model had perfect calibration.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: We sought to identify the clinical variables most critical to successful treatment of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among the factors tested were age at diagnosis (< 2 years or > or = 2 years), time from diagnosis to initiation of treatment with or without etoposide-containing regimens, timing of cyclosporin A (CSA) administration during induction therapy, and the presence or absence of etoposide. RESULTS: By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the overall survival rate for the entire cohort of 47 patients, most of whom had moderately severe to severe disease, was 78.3% +/- 6.7% (SE) at 4 years. The probability of long-term survival was significantly higher when etoposide treatment was begun less than 4 weeks from diagnosis (90.2% +/- 6.9% v 56.5% +/- 12.6% for patients receiving this agent later or not at all; P <.01, log-rank test). Multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated the independent prognostic significance of a short interval from EBV-HLH diagnosis to etoposide administration (relative risk of death for patients lacking this feature, 14.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 166.7; P =.04). None of the competing variables analyzed had significant predictive strength in the Cox model. However, concomitant use of CSA with etoposide in a subset of patients appears to have prevented serious complications from neutropenia during the first year of treatment. CONCLUSION: We conclude that early administration of etoposide, preferably with CSA, is the treatment of choice for patients with EBV-HLH.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Disparities in health care have been documented between different racial groups in the United States. We hypothesize that there will be racial variance in the timing of the Glenn and Fontan procedures for children with single-ventricle physiology.
DESIGN AND SETTING: We performed a retrospective review of a national pediatric intensive care unit database (Virtual PICU Performance System, LLC).
PATIENTS: Children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tricuspid atresia, and common ventricle, admitted from January 2006 to July 2008, were included. Data included race, weight, age, medical length of stay, Paediatric Index of Mortality 2 score, and survival.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 423 patients from 29 hospitals. The study population was 7.6% black, 13.0% Hispanic, 59.8% white, 9.2% "other," and 11.6% had missing racial/ethnic information. Diagnoses included 255 patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, 91 with tricuspid atresia, and 77 with common ventricle. The median age for the Glenn procedure (n = 205) was 5.5 months (interquartile range, 4.6-7.0 months) and 39.7 months (interquartile range, 32.4-50.6 months) for the Fontan procedure (n = 218). There was no difference between the median age at the time of the Glenn or Fontan procedures between the different racial/ethnic groups (p = .65 and p = .16, respectively). The medical length of intensive care unit stay for patients receiving the Glenn and Fontan procedures was 3.7 days (interquartile range, 1.9-6.1 days) and 3.7 days (interquartile range, 1.9-6.8 days), respectively. There were no differences in medical length of intensive care unit stay for the Glenn procedure between the different racial/ethnic groups (p = .21). Hispanic patients had a longer medical length of intensive care unit stay (6.3 days; interquartile range, 3.1-9.9 days) than white patients (2.9 days; interquartile range, 1.8-5.3 days) for the Fontan procedure (p = .008).
CONCLUSION: The timing of single-ventricle palliative procedures was not affected by race/ethnicity.},

  Abstract                 = {Kinetic data for structural relaxation in silver iodomolybdates at the glass transition temperature (Tg) are obtained by high-pressure differential scanning calorimetry (HP-DSC) and are compared with activation energies (EA) and volumes (VA) obtained earlier from conductivities below Tg. The results are fitted to an empirical equation, EA = MVA, and displayed in the form of a master plot of EA versus VA, an approach previously applied to strongly coupled systems, including polymer electrolytes and molten salts above their glass transition temperatures. The parameter M emerges as a localized modulus, expressive of interatomic forces within the medium, linking together EA,sigma, VA,sigma and EA,s, VA,s, the "apparent" activation parameters for ionic conductivity and structural relaxation, respectively. The VA and EA values for ion transport are much smaller than the corresponding values for structural relaxation. However, remarkably close agreement emerges between the "process parameters", Ms and Msigma, both close to 8 GPa, thus establishing a quantitative link between ion transport and structural relaxation in this highly decoupled system. A new EA versus VA master plot is constructed, which points the way to a unified approach to ion transport in polymers and glasses.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: We conducted a systematic review of epidemiological evidence to evaluate the association between alcohol drinking and total cancer risk among the Japanese population. METHODS: Original data were obtained from MEDLINE searches using PubMed or from searches of the Ichushi database, complemented with manual searches. Evaluation of associations was based on the strength of evidence and the magnitude of association, together with biological plausibility as previously evaluated by the International Agency of Research on Cancer. RESULTS: Of eight cohort studies identified, six studies, three of which included women, were subjected to evaluation. In men, all six studies showed a weak to moderate positive association between alcohol drinking and total cancer risk. While light drinking had little effect on total cancer risk, heavy drinking of more than 46-69 g of alcohol per day contributed to total cancer risk for most of these Japanese populations. However, no association was reported in women in any of the three studies. CONCLUSION: We conclude that there is convincing evidence that alcohol drinking increases the risk of total cancer in the Japanese population, specifically among heavy drinking men.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: In Nepal, male adolescent students are at high risk for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because of their risky sexual behaviours. This study examined whether two subscales of the Health Belief Model (HBM), perceived severity and perceived susceptibility, are associated with abstinence intention among Nepalese male adolescent students for HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A school-based study was conducted at a single school located in central Kathmandu from July to August 2002. Participants included 183 male students in Grades 9-12 aged 14-19 years. Anonymous self-reported questionnaires were used, and Zagumny's AIDS Health Belief Scale was adopted as a measure of perceived severity and perceived susceptibility. RESULTS: Over half of the students (53%) strongly agreed with abstinence intention. Students with higher levels of perceived severity strongly agreed with abstinence intention [crude odds ratio 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-3.38; adjusted odds ratio 1.94, 95% CI 1.05-3.58], but those with higher levels of perceived susceptibility did not. Moreover, age-stratified analysis showed that a high level of perceived susceptibility tended to decrease strong abstinence intention among students aged 16-19 years. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived severity enhanced abstinence intention. The interpretations of perceived susceptibility need further examination through a longitudinal study among students aged 16-19 years. Furthermore, future research is needed to assess the effect of HIV/AIDS education on HIV/AIDS prevention strategies using perceived severity as a motivational tool to help persuade Nepalese male students to abstain from sexual intercourse.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in gastric mucosa may cause systemic inflammatory reaction. This study aimed to examine the association between the infection and serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). METHODS: Subjects were comprised of three groups; 453 health checkup examinees from Yakumo town inhabitants in Hokkaido, Japan (YTI, 153 males and 300 females), 449 health checkup examinees (ENUH, 273 males and 176 females), and 255 female patients of an infertility clinic (PIC), Nagoya University Hospital. Twenty participants with hsCRP more than 1 mg/dl were excluded from the analysis. Those with hsCRP more than 0.1mg/dl were defined as high hsCRP individuals. H. pylori infection status was examined with a serum IgG antibody test. RESULTS: When the three groups were combined, the geometric mean of hsCRP concentration was significantly higher among the seropositives (0.047 mg/dl) than among the seronegatives (0.035 mg/dl); p<0.0001 by a t-test. The percentage of high hsCRP individuals was also higher in the seropositives than in the seronegatives among any group; 23.3% and 20.1% in YTI, 22.0% and 16.0% in ENUH, and 32.7% and 18.7% in PIC, respectively, although the difference was significant only in ENUH. The summary odds ratio of the high hsCRP for the seropositives relative to the seronegatives was 1.38 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.89), when age, sex, body mass index, smoking, and subject group were adjusted by a logistic model. CONCLUSIONS: In three groups, hsCRP was higher among the infected individuals. The summary odd ratio indicated that H. pylori infection could influence the serum hsCRP level.},

This article sought to review the data on the current patterns of use of interhospital transfer and identify systematic barriers to optimal integration of transfer as a mechanism for improving patient outcomes and value of care. DATA SOURCE: Narrative review of medical and organizational literature. SUMMARY: Interhospital transfer of patients is common, but not optimized to improve patient outcomes. Although there is a wide variability in quality among hospitals of nominally the same capability, patients are not consistently transferred to the highest quality nearby hospital. Instead, transfer destinations are selected by organizational routines or non-patient-centered organizational priorities. Accomplishing a transfer is often quite difficult for sending hospitals. But once a transfer destination is successfully found, the mechanics of interhospital transfer now appear quite safe. CONCLUSION: Important technological advances now make it possible to identify nearby hospitals best able to help critically ill patients, and to successfully transfer patients to those hospitals. However, organizational structures have not yet developed to insure that patients are optimally routed, resulting in potentially significant excess mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the absolute number of Medicare beneficiaries surviving at least 3 years after severe sepsis and to estimate their burden of cognitive dysfunction and disability. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of Medicare data. SETTING: All short-stay inpatient hospitals in the United States, 1996 to 2008. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older. MEASUREMENTS: Severe sepsis was detected using a standard administrative definition. Case-fatality, prevalence, and incidence rates were calculated. RESULTS: Six hundred thirty-seven thousand eight hundred sixty-seven Medicare beneficiaries were alive at the end of 2008 who had survived severe sepsis 3 or more years earlier. An estimated 476,862 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 455,026-498,698) had functional disability, with 106,311 (95% CI = 79,692-133,930) survivors having moderate to severe cognitive impairment. The annual number of new 3-year survivors after severe sepsis rose 119% during 1998 to 2008. The increase in survivorship resulted from more new diagnoses of severe sepsis rather than a change in case-fatality rates; severe sepsis rates rose from 13.0 per 1,000 Medicare beneficiary-years to 25.8 (P < .001), whereas 3-year case fatality rates changed much less, from 73.5% to 71.3% (P < .001) for the same cohort. Increasing rates of organ dysfunction in hospitalized individuals drove the increase in severe sepsis incidence, with an additional small contribution from population aging. CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis survivorship, which has substantial long-term morbidity, is a common and rapidly growing public health problem for older Americans. There has been little change in long-term case-fatality, despite changes in practice. Clinicians should anticipate more-frequent sequelae of severe sepsis in their patient populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Internationally accepted approaches to the study of functioning and disability can inform critical care practitioners and scholars in their study of functional limitations, disability, and quality of life after critical illness and intensive care. Therefore this article provides an introduction to the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The Institute of Medicine has also recommended this approach for the study of disability. This conceptual framework divides potential problems as follows: problems in body structure and tissue, limitations in activity (i.e., functional limitations as assessed in standardized environments), and restrictions in participation (i.e., the inability to fulfill a social role). The ICF draws attention to effect modifiers that can prevent problems at one level from progressing (or conversely can hasten their progression) to profound decrements in a patient's quality of life. It is particularly relevant for studies of long-term outcomes after critical illness and post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). This article provides a discussion of the ICF specific to the intensive care unit and the disablement process, with particular attention to new opportunities for intervention and their implications for cost and quality of life.},

  Abstract                 = {RATIONALE: Survivors of critical illness suffer significant limitations and disabilities. OBJECTIVES: Ascertain whether severe sepsis is associated with increased risk of so-called geriatric conditions (injurious falls, low body mass index [BMI], incontinence, vision loss, hearing loss, and chronic pain) and whether this association is measured consistently across three different study designs. METHODS: Patients with severe sepsis were identified in the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative cohort interviewed every 2 years, 1998 to 2006, and in linked Medicare claims. Three comparators were used to assess an association of severe sepsis with geriatric conditions in survivors: the prevalence in the United States population aged 65 years and older, survivors' own pre-sepsis levels assessed before hospitalization, or survivors' own pre-sepsis trajectory. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Six hundred twenty-three severe sepsis hospitalizations were followed a median of 0.92 years. When compared with the 65 years and older population, surviving severe sepsis was associated with increased rates of low BMI, injurious falls, incontinence, and vision loss. Results were similar when comparing survivors to their own pre-sepsis levels. The association of low BMI and severe sepsis persisted when controlling for patients' pre-sepsis trajectories, but there was no association of severe sepsis with injurious falls, incontinence, vision loss, hearing loss, and chronic pain after such controls. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric conditions are common after severe sepsis. However, severe sepsis is associated with increased rates of only a subset of geriatric conditions, not all. In studying outcomes after acute illness, failing to measure and control for both preillness levels and trajectories may result in erroneous conclusions.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:: Severe sepsis is a common and costly problem. Although consistently defined clinically by consensus conference since 1991, there have been several different implementations of the severe sepsis definition using ICD-9-CM codes for research. We conducted a single center, patient-level validation of 1 common implementation of the severe sepsis definition, the so-called "Angus" implementation. METHODS:: Administrative claims for all hospitalizations for patients initially admitted to general medical services from an academic medical center in 2009-2010 were reviewed. On the basis of ICD-9-CM codes, hospitalizations were sampled for review by 3 internal medicine-trained hospitalists. Chart reviews were conducted with a structured instrument, and the gold standard was the hospitalists' summary clinical judgment on whether the patient had severe sepsis. RESULTS:: Three thousand one hundred forty-six (13.5%) hospitalizations met ICD-9-CM criteria for severe sepsis by the Angus implementation (Angus-positive) and 20,142 (86.5%) were Angus-negative. Chart reviews were performed for 92 randomly selected Angus-positive and 19 randomly-selected Angus-negative hospitalizations. Reviewers had a kappa of 0.70. The Angus implementation's positive predictive value was 70.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 51.2%, 90.5%]. The negative predictive value was 91.5% (95% CI: 79.0%, 100%). The sensitivity was 50.4% (95% CI: 14.8%, 85.7%). Specificity was 96.3% (95% CI: 92.4%, 100%). Two alternative ICD-9-CM implementations had high positive predictive values but sensitivities of <20%. CONCLUSIONS:: The Angus implementation of the international consensus conference definition of severe sepsis offers a reasonable but imperfect approach to identifying patients with severe sepsis when compared with a gold standard of structured review of the medical chart by trained hospitalists.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Critically ill children with bronchiolitis often require red blood cell transfusions. Anemia normally results in increased circulating erythropoietin concentrations; however, critical illness has been associated with a blunted erythropoietin response. Treatment with erythropoietin decreases the need for red blood cell transfusion in several disease states. We hypothesized that critically ill children with bronchiolitis and anemia would have a circulating erythropoietin deficiency and that treatment with exogenous erythropoietin would increase reticulocyte count and hematocrit and reduce red blood cell transfusion requirements. DESIGN: Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Children's hospital. PATIENTS: Critically ill children with bronchiolitis, anemia, and respiratory failure. Anemia was defined as a hematocrit >2 SD below normal for age. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to one of two groups. In the erythropoietin group, patients received daily intravenous erythropoietin. In the control group, patients received daily intravenous placebo. Both groups were treated with elemental iron. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood for complete blood count, reticulocyte count, and ferritin and erythropoietin concentration was obtained at admission and discharge. Red blood cell transfusions were administered to patients with a persistent oxygen requirement and a hematocrit of <25%. Outcome variables included number of red blood cell transfusions, change in reticulocyte count, ferritin values, and circulating erythropoietin values between groups. Forty-four patients completed the study (mean 3.1 +/- 0.6 months), with a baseline hematocrit of 27.6 +/- 0.5%, ventilator days of 8.2 +/- 0.6, and pediatric intensive care unit length of stay of 9.8 +/- 0.6 days. There were no significant baseline demographic differences between the control and erythropoietin groups. Ten of 22 (45%) children in the erythropoietin group required red blood cell transfusion compared with 11 of 22 (50%) in the control group (p = nonsignificant). The increase in reticulocyte count was greater in the erythropoietin group compared with the control group (2.1 +/- 0.3% to 4.7 +/- 0.7%, p = .003 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.3% to 2.7 +/- 0.5%, p = nonsignificant). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a favorable reticulocyte and circulating erythropoietin response, red blood cell transfusion requirements were not significantly diminished by erythropoietin treatment in children with bronchiolitis and respiratory failure. Erythropoietin cannot be routinely recommended for this patient population.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare database complements The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database by providing information about long-term outcomes and cost. This study demonstrates the feasibility of linking STS data to CMS data and examines the penetration, completeness, and representativeness of the STS database. METHODS: Using variables common to both STS and CMS databases, STS operations were linked to CMS data for all CMS coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) hospitalizations discharged between 2000 and 2007, inclusive. For each CMS CABG hospitalization, it was determined whether a matching STS record existed. RESULTS: Center-level penetration (number of CMS sites with at least one matched STS participant divided by the total number of CMS CABG sites) increased from 45% to 78%. In 2007, 854 of 1,101 CMS CABG sites (78%) were linked to an STS site. Patient-level penetration (number of CMS CABG hospitalizations done at STS sites divided by the total number of CMS CABG hospitalizations) increased from 51% to 84%. In 2007, 94,409 of 111,967 CMS CABG hospitalizations (84%) were at an STS site. Completeness of case inclusion at STS sites (number of CMS CABG cases at STS sites linked to STS records divided by the total number of CMS CABG cases at STS sites) increased from 88% to 97%. In 2007, 88,857 of 91,363 CMS CABG hospitalizations at STS sites (97%) were linked to an STS record. CONCLUSIONS: The successful linking of STS and CMS databases demonstrates high and increasing penetration and completeness of the STS database. Linking STS and CMS data will facilitate studying long-term outcomes of cardiothoracic surgery.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Long-term evaluation of cardiothoracic surgical outcomes is a major goal of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS). Linking the STS Database to the Social Security Death Master File (SSDMF) allows for the verification of "life status." This study demonstrates the feasibility of linking the STS Database to the SSDMF and examines longitudinal survival after cardiac operations. METHODS: For all operations in the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database performed in 2008 in patients with an available Social Security Number, the SSDMF was searched for a matching Social Security Number. Survival probabilities at 30 days and 1 year were estimated for nine common operations. RESULTS: A Social Security Number was available for 101,188 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting, 12,336 patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement, and 6,085 patients undergoing isolated mitral valve operations. One-year survival for isolated coronary artery bypass grafting was 88.9% (6,529 of 7,344) with all vein grafts, 95.2% (84,696 of 88,966) with a single mammary artery graft, 97.4% (4,422 of 4,540) with bilateral mammary artery grafts, and 95.6% (7,543 of 7,890) with all arterial grafts. One-year survival was 92.4% (11,398 of 12,336) for isolated aortic valve replacement (95.6% [2,109 of 2,206] with mechanical prosthesis and 91.7% [9,289 of 10,130] with biologic prosthesis), 86.5% (2,312 of 2,674) for isolated mitral valve replacement (91.7% [923 of 1,006] with mechanical prosthesis and 83.3% [1,389 of 1,668] with biologic prosthesis), and 96.0% (3,275 of 3,411) for isolated mitral valve repair. CONCLUSIONS: Successful linkage to the SSDMF has substantially increased the power of the STS Database. These longitudinal survival data from this large multi-institutional study provide reassurance about the durability and long-term benefits of cardiac operations and constitute a contemporary benchmark for survival after cardiac operations.},

  Abstract                 = {This review discusses the historical aspects, current state of the art, and potential future advances in the areas of nomenclature and databases for the analysis of outcomes of treatments for patients with congenitally malformed hearts. We will consider the current state of analysis of outcomes, lay out some principles which might make it possible to achieve life-long monitoring and follow-up using our databases, and describe the next steps those involved in the care of these patients need to take in order to achieve these objectives. In order to perform meaningful multi-institutional analyses, we suggest that any database must incorporate the following six essential elements: use of a common language and nomenclature, use of an established uniform core dataset for collection of information, incorporation of a mechanism of evaluating case complexity, availability of a mechanism to assure and verify the completeness and accuracy of the data collected, collaboration between medical and surgical subspecialties, and standardised protocols for life-long follow-up. During the 1990s, both The European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons created databases to assess the outcomes of congenital cardiac surgery. Beginning in 1998, these two organizations collaborated to create the International Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project. By 2000, a common nomenclature, along with a common core minimal dataset, were adopted by The European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and published in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery. In 2000, The International Nomenclature Committee for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease was established. This committee eventually evolved into the International Society for Nomenclature of Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease. The working component of this international nomenclature society has been The International Working Group for Mapping and Coding of Nomenclatures for Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease, also known as the Nomenclature Working Group. By 2005, the Nomenclature Working Group crossmapped the nomenclature of the International Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project of The European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons with the European Paediatric Cardiac Code of the Association for European Paediatric Cardiology, and therefore created the International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code, which is available for free download from the internet at [http://www.IPCCC.NET]. This common nomenclature, the International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code, and the common minimum database data set created by the International Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project, are now utilized by both The European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Between 1998 and 2007 inclusive, this nomenclature and database was used by both of these two organizations to analyze outcomes of over 150,000 operations involving patients undergoing surgical treatment for congenital cardiac disease. Two major multi-institutional efforts that have attempted to measure the complexity of congenital heart surgery are the Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 system, and the Aristotle Complexity Score. Current efforts to unify the Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 system and the Aristotle Complexity Score are in their early stages, but encouraging. Collaborative efforts involving The European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons are under way to develop mechanisms to verify the completeness and accuracy of the data in the databases. Under the leadership of The MultiSocietal Database Committee for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease, further collaborative efforts are ongoing between congenital and paediatric cardiac surgeons and other subspecialties, including paediatric cardiac anaesthesiologists, via The Congenital Cardiac Anesthesia Society, paediatric cardiac intensivists, via The Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society, and paediatric cardiologists, via the Joint Council on Congenital Heart Disease and The Association for European Paediatric Cardiology. In finalizing our review, we emphasise that analysis of outcomes must move beyond mortality, and encompass longer term follow-up, including cardiac and non cardiac morbidities, and importantly, those morbidities impacting health related quality of life. Methodologies must be implemented in these databases to allow uniform, protocol driven, and meaningful, long term follow-up.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The analysis of the second harvest of the STS Congenital Heart Surgery Database produced meaningful outcome data and several critical lessons relevant to congenital heart surgery outcomes analysis worldwide. METHODS: This data harvest represents the first STS multi-institutional experience with software utilizing the nomenclature and database requirements adopted by the STS and EACTS (April 2000 Annals of Thoracic Surgery). Members of the STS Congenital Heart Committee analyzed the STS data. RESULTS: This STS harvest includes data from 16 centers (12787 cases, 2881 neonates, 4124 infants). In 2002, the EACTS reported similar outcome data utilizing the same database definitions (41 centers, 12736 cases, 2245 neonates, 4195 infants). Lessons from the analysis include: (1) Death must be clearly defined. (2) The Primary Procedure in a given operation must be documented. (3) Inclusionary and exclusionary criteria for all diagnoses and procedures must be agreed upon. (4) Missing data values remain an issue for the database. (5) Generic terms in the nomenclature lists, that is terms ending in Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), are redundant and decrease the clarity of data analysis. (6) Methodology needs to be developed and implemented to assure and verify data completeness and data accuracy. 'Operative Mortality' and 'Mortality Assigned to this Operation' were defined by the STS and EACTS; these definitions were not utilized uniformly. 'Thirty Day Mortality' was problematic because some centers did not track mortality after hospital discharge. Only 'Mortality Prior to Discharge' was consistently reported. Designation of Primary Procedure for a given operation determines its location for analysis. Until Complexity Scores lead to automated methodology for choosing the Primary Procedure, the surgeon must designate the Primary Procedure. Inclusionary and exclusionary criteria for all diagnoses and procedures have been developed in an effort to define acceptable concomitant diagnoses and procedures for each analysis. Improvements in data completeness can be achieved using a variety of techniques including developing more functional techniques of data entry at individual institutions and software improvements. Future versions of the STS Congenital Database will request that the coding of diagnoses and procedures avoid the terms ending in NOS. CONCLUSIONS: Lessons from this data harvest should improve congenital heart surgery outcome analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: We evaluated outcomes for common operations in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (STS-CHSDB) to provide contemporary benchmarks and examine variation between centers. METHODS: Patients undergoing surgery from 2005 to 2009 were included. Centers with greater than 10% missing data were excluded. Discharge mortality and postoperative length of stay (PLOS) among patients discharged alive were calculated for 8 benchmark operations of varying complexity. Power for analyzing between-center variation in outcome was determined for each operation. Variation was evaluated using funnel plots and Bayesian hierarchical modeling. RESULTS: Eighteen thousand three hundred seventy-five index operations at 74 centers were included in the analysis of 8 benchmark operations. Overall discharge mortality was: ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair = 0.6% (range, 0% to 5.1%), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair = 1.1% (range, 0% to 16.7%), complete atrioventricular canal repair (AVC) = 2.2% (range, 0% to 20%), arterial switch operation (ASO) = 2.9% (range, 0% to 50%), ASO + VSD = 7.0% (range, 0% to 100%), Fontan operation = 1.3% (range, 0% to 9.1%), truncus arteriosus repair = 10.9% (0% to 100%), and Norwood procedure = 19.3% (range, 0% to 100%). Funnel plots revealed that the number of centers characterized as outliers were VSD = 0, TOF = 0, AVC = 1, ASO = 3, ASO + VSD = 1, Fontan operation = 0, truncus arteriosus repair = 4, and Norwood procedure = 11. Power calculations showed that statistically meaningful comparisons of mortality rates between centers could be made only for the Norwood procedure, for which the Bayesian-estimated range (95% probability interval) after risk-adjustment was 7.0% (3.7% to 10.3%) to 41.6% (30.6% to 57.2%). Between-center variation in PLOS was analyzed for all operations and was larger for more complex operations. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis documents contemporary benchmarks for common pediatric cardiac surgical operations and the range of outcomes among centers. Variation was most prominent for the more complex operations. These data may aid in quality assessment and quality improvement initiatives.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Workforce on Congenital Heart Surgery undertook a second subspecialty Practice and Manpower Survey (2005, 2010) to obtain contemporary data. METHODS: Preliminary research suggested a potential target group of 273 congenital heart surgeons, including 258 at 125 US centers and 15 at 8 Canadian centers. The web-based survey was sent to these surgeons, plus all individuals listing pediatric cardiac surgery on CTSNet. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-six responders included 213 active congenital heart surgeons, 16 retired congenital heart surgeons, and 17 surgeons in training. Retirement age was 63.5+/-7.5 years. Two hundred thirteen active congenital heart surgeon responders represent 78% of the original estimate. Their responses generated the following data: The mean age was 49.2+/-8.5 (range, 35 to 75 years). American medical school graduates included 159 of 201 respondents (79%). Years of postgraduate training was 9.7+/-1.7. One hundred ninety-seven (92%) respondents were certified in thoracic surgery by the American Board of Thoracic Surgery (ABTS). Twenty-eight of 200 (14%) received their congenital heart surgery training outside the United States or Canada. One hundred forty-three of 190 respondents (75%) perform exclusively congenital heart operations; 31 (16%) perform exclusively pediatric heart operations. Of 186 respondents, 54 (29%) perform fewer than 100 major congenital heart operations per year, 78 (42%) perform 100 to 199 procedures, and 54 (29%) perform 200 procedures or more. Active congenital heart surgeons have been in their current positions for 9.3+/-8.6 years. Eight respondents are in their first year of practice. For 203 respondents, mean anticipated years to retirement is 16.1+/-7.6. Twenty-eight anticipate retirement within 5 years; 31 in 6 to 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: These data should help facilitate rational plans to meet workforce needs for an expanding patient population.},

  Abstract                 = {In a retrospective analysis of 2110 admissions to the pediatric intensive care unit, 564 cases of septic shock were identified (26.7% of the total admissions). Septic shock was defined in patients with: (1) clinical evidence of sepsis; (2) fever (greater than 38.3 degrees C) or hypothermia (less than 35.6 degrees C); (3) tachycardia; (4) tachypnea; and (5) inadequate organ perfusion. Inadequate perfusion was defined as hypotension or evidence of peripheral hypoperfusion (poor capillary refill or cyanosis with hypoxemia, oliguria, acidosis or altered mentation). Inotropic support was required to maintain an adequate blood pressure and perfusion in 268 of 564 patients (47.5%). Septic shock with confirmed bacterial infection occurred in 143 patients (143 of 564, 25.2%); these cases were caused by Haemophilus influenzae, type b (59 of 143, 41.3%), Neisseria meningitidis (26 of 143, 18.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (16 of 143, 11.2%). Eight of 564 (1.4%) cases of septic shock were not clinically apparent on initial evaluation and were diagnosed within 24 hours after admission to the hospital. We conclude that septic shock occurs more frequently in children than previously appreciated and may develop after admission to the hospital.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECT: The management strategies and outcomes in pediatric patients with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are examined in this study. METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of a prospectively acquired pediatric trauma database. More than 750 pediatric patients with brain injury were seen over a 10-year period. Records were retrospectively reviewed to determine interventions for correcting ICP, and surviving patients were contacted prospectively to determine functional status and quality of life. Only patients with 2 years of follow-up were included in the study. RESULTS: Ninety-six pediatric patients (age range 3-18 years) were identified with a Glasgow Coma Scale score<8 and elevated ICP>20 mm Hg on presentation. The mean injury severity score was 65 (range 30-100). All patients were treated using a standardized head injury protocol. The mean time course until peak ICP was 69 hours postinjury (range 2-196 hours). Intracranial pressure control was achieved in 82 patients (85%). Methods employed to achieve ICP control included maximal medical therapy (sedation, hyperosmolar therapy, and paralysis) in 34 patients (35%), ventriculostomy in 23 patients (24%), and surgery in 39 patients (41%). Fourteen patients (15%) had refractory ICP despite all interventions, and all of these patients died. Seventy-two patients (75%) were discharged from the hospital, whereas 24 (25%) died during hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of vascular injury, refractory ICP, and cisternal effacement at presentation had the highest correlation with subsequent death (p<0.05). Mean follow-up was 53 months (range 11-126 months). Three patients died during the follow-up period (2 due to infections and 1 committed suicide). The mean 2-year Glasgow Outcome Scale score was 4 (median 4, range 1-5). The mean patient competency rating at follow-up was 4.13 out of 5 (median 4.5, range 1-4.8). Univariate analysis revealed that the extent of intracranial and systemic injuries had the highest correlation with long-term quality of life (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Controlling elevated ICP is an important factor in patient survival following severe pediatric TBI. The modality used for ICP control appears to be less important. Long-term follow-up is essential to determine neurocognitive sequelae associated with TBI.},

  Abstract                 = {Patients with palliated tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) often require pulmonary valve replacement in adulthood, yet the data regarding their outcomes are scarce. This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with postoperative complications in these patients and to establish long-term survival data for this patient group. A retrospective cohort study investigated 153 consecutive patients with a history of TOF repair who underwent pulmonary valve replacement at a single large academic center between March 1996 and March 2010. In part 1 of the study, logistic models were constructed to assess demographic, medical, and surgical risk factors for operative mortality; occurrence of a major adverse event (stroke, renal failure, prolonged ventilation, deep sternal infection, reoperation, or operative mortality); and prolonged hospital stay (>7 days). Risk factors with a p value less than 0.10 by univariate analysis were included in the subsequent multivariate analysis. In part 2 of the study, long-term, all-cause mortality was determined by construction of a Kaplan-Meier curve for the cohort. Seven patients died (4.5%). Significant risk factors for mortality in the multivariable analysis included age older than 40 years (odds ratio (OR) 9.89) and concomitant surgery (OR 6.65). A major adverse event occurred for 22 patients (14.4%). The only significant risk factor in the multivariable analysis for an adverse event was concomitant surgery (OR 6.42). The hospital stay was longer than 7 days for 31 patients (20.3%). The significant risk factors for a prolonged hospital stay included the presence of preoperative arrhythmias (OR 4.17), New York Heart Association class 3 (OR 4.35), and again, concomitant surgery (OR 4.2). Among the 146 hospital survivors, only 5 patients died in the intervening period. The predicted survival rates were 98.5% at 1 year, 96.7% at 5 years, and 93.5% at 10 years. Pulmonary valve replacement in adults with palliated TOF is a safe procedure with excellent long-term survival, but there remain important risk factors for postoperative mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and major adverse events. Awareness and modification of important risk factors may help to improve outcomes.},

Sixty patients received 120 bolus infusions of mannitol (0.18-2.5 g/kg/dose) with a prompt peak reduction at 44 minutes (range 18 to 120 minutes). There was no relationship between dosage and rapidity of peak response. All administrations of 1.0g/kg/dose, or higher, consistently reduced ICP 10% or more from control values, but dosages below 1 gm/kg/dose did not always reduce ICP. Return to control ICP following mannitol was unpredictable, and was related to the initial ICP and the volume of fluid replacement. A continuous infusion of mannitol was administered to maintain ICP below 25 torr in 18 patients. This infusion ranged from 6 to 100 hours (X 28.8+/-28.9 hours) and required a total dosage of 2-20 mg/kg, and was successful in 16 of the 18 patients. Emphasis is placed on close observation of the patient's serum osmolality and electrolytes during therapy, as well as quality and magnitude of replacement. No set rules are given for control of ICP, but a guideline is made to meet the individual patient's requirements.},

Ten patients (Group A) underwent shunt removal and, in addition to receiving systemic antibiotics, were treated by either external ventricular drainage or intermittent ventricular taps for decompression and antibiotic administration; 10 patients (Group B) were treated by removal and immediate replacement of the shunt and intrashunt antibiotic therapy; and 10 patients (Group C) received antibiotics without removal or replacement of the shunt. All patients were given intravenous and intraventricular antibiotics as follows: in Group A, antibiotics were given by both the intravenous and the intraventricular routes for a minimal period of 7 days; in Group B, intravenous antibiotics were administered for a minimal period of 3 weeks and twice daily intraventricular antibiotics were given for a minimal period of 2 weeks; in Group C, intravenous antibiotics were administered for a minimal period of 3 weeks and twice daily intraventricular antibiotics were given for a minimal period of 2 weeks. In all patients, CSF was obtained from the shunt and cultured 48 hours after the cessation of antibiotic therapy, and the cultures were repeated within 4 months of the completion of treatment. All patients in Group A and 9 of 10 patients in Group B were treated successfully. They were clinically asymptomatic, and cultures after treatment were sterile. However, only 3 patients in Group C responded to treatment. The remaining patients of Group C had persistent infections requiring additional therapy. The mean follow-up of the study group was 23 +/- 14 (SD) months. The mean hospitalization time for the study group was 33 +/- 21 days; the hospitalization time was 24.7 +/- 17 days for Group A alone, 32.7 +/- 8 days for Group B, and 47 +/- 37 days Group C.},

Biochemical markers include elevated ferritin and triglycerides, and low fibrinogen. Whereas in children several inherited immune deficiencies may lead to this syndrome, most adults with HLH have no known underlying immune defect. Nevertheless, impaired function of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) is characteristic for both genetic and acquired forms of HLH. Frequent triggers are infectious agents, mostly viruses of the herpes group. Malignant lymphomas, especially in adults, may be associated with HLH. A special form of HLH in rheumatic diseases is called macrophage-activation syndrome. Initially HLH may masquerade as a normal infection since all symptoms, even though less pronounced, may also be found in immune competent patients. Patients with HLH, however, cannot control the hyperinflammatory response which, if untreated, is fatal in genetic cases and in a high percentage of acquired cases. Awareness of the clinical symptoms and of the diagnostic criteria of HLH is important to start life-saving therapy with immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agents in time.},

  Abstract                 = {There is uncertainty whether the 2009 seasonal influenza vaccination influences the risk of infection with the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus. This issue was investigated in 548 healthcare workers from Capital and Coast District Health Board, Wellington, New Zealand, presenting with influenza-like illness during the influenza pandemic between June and August 2009. All workers completed an assessment sheet and had a nasopharyngeal swab tested by real-time RT-PCR. The risk of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) infection associated with the 2009 seasonal inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine was determined by logistic regression, with adjustment for potential confounding variables. In 96 workers pandemic influenza A(H1N1) RNA was detected and 452 tested negative. The multivariate analysis did not show any effect of vaccination on PCR-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection (odds ratio 1.2, 95% confidence interval 0.7-1.9, p=0.48). We conclude that 2009 seasonal influenza vaccination had no protective effect against influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection amongst healthcare workers. To protect against further waves of the current pandemic influenza or future pandemics in which the influenza virus is antigenically distinct from contemporary seasonal influenza viruses, it would be necessary to vaccinate with a specific pandemic influenza vaccine, or a seasonal influenza vaccine that includes the pandemic influenza serotype.},

Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,437,180 new cancer cases and 565,650 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2008. Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality include stabilization of incidence rates for all cancer sites combined in men from 1995 through 2004 and in women from 1999 through 2004 and a continued decrease in the cancer death rate since 1990 in men and since 1991 in women. Overall cancer death rates in 2004 compared with 1990 in men and 1991 in women decreased by 18.4% and 10.5%, respectively, resulting in the avoidance of over a half million deaths from cancer during this time interval. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, education, geographic area, and calendar year, as well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall trends. Although much progress has been made in reducing mortality rates, stabilizing incidence rates, and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons under age 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries and by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.},

  Abstract                 = {Reducing rates of rehospitalization has attracted attention from policymakers as a way to improve quality of care and reduce costs. However, we have limited information on the frequency and patterns of rehospitalization in the United States to aid in planning the necessary changes.We analyzed Medicare claims data from 2003-2004 to describe the patterns of rehospitalization and the relation of rehospitalization to demographic characteristics of the patients and to characteristics of the hospitals.Almost one fifth (19.6\%) of the 11,855,702 Medicare beneficiaries who had been discharged from a hospital were rehospitalized within 30 days, and 34.0\% were rehospitalized within 90 days; 67.1\% [corrected] of patients who had been discharged with medical conditions and 51.5\% of those who had been discharged after surgical procedures were rehospitalized or died within the first year after discharge. In the case of 50.2\% [corrected] of the patients who were rehospitalized within 30 days after a medical discharge to the community, there was no bill for a visit to a physician's office between the time of discharge and rehospitalization. Among patients who were rehospitalized within 30 days after a surgical discharge, 70.5\% were rehospitalized for a medical condition. We estimate that about 10\% of rehospitalizations were likely to have been planned. The average stay of rehospitalized patients was 0.6 day longer than that of patients in the same diagnosis-related group whose most recent hospitalization had been at least 6 months previously. We estimate that the cost to Medicare of unplanned rehospitalizations in 2004 was $17.4 billion.Rehospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries are prevalent and costly.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The aim was to develop a consensus-based method of risk adjustment for in-hospital mortality among children younger than 18 years after surgery for congenital heart disease (designated RACHS-1). METHODS: An 11-member national panel of pediatric cardiologists and cardiac surgeons used clinical judgment to place surgical procedures into six risk categories. Categories were refined after review of information from the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium and three statewide hospital discharge data sets. The effects of including additional clinical variables were explored by comparing areas under receiver-operator characteristic curves. RESULTS: Among 4602 surgical patients in the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium data set and 4493 in the hospital discharge data, 3767 (81.9%) and 3832 (85.3%), respectively, had a single cardiac procedure, and 98.5% and 89.2%, respectively, were able to be assigned to one of six risk categories defined by the panel. Mortality rates showed expected trends (P <.001). For the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium data, mortality rates were 0.4% in category 1, 3.8% in 2, 8.5% in 3, 19.4% in 4, and 47.7% in 6; rates were similar in the hospital discharge data. There were too few cases in category 5 to estimate mortality rates. In multivariable models, younger age, prematurity, and the presence of a major noncardiac structural anomaly added to the risk of in-hospital death predicted by risk category alone. Best performance was obtained when cases with multiple procedures were placed in the risk category of the most complex procedure. CONCLUSION: The RACHS-1 method should adjust for baseline risk differences and allow meaningful comparisons of in-hospital mortality for groups of children undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has become standard in the management of severe head injuries. A variety of monitoring techniques and devices are available, each with advantages and disadvantages; however there have been few studies in the pediatric population. METHODS: To study the risk factors, efficacy, and complication rate of fiberoptic ICP monitoring we studied 98 consecutive children with severe head injuries over a 2-year period. The average patient age was 9 years and most had an initial Childrens Coma Score (CCS) of 8 or less. The monitoring devices were placed in frontal parenchyma of all children and no prophylactic antibiotics were used. All fiberoptic catheter tips were cultured upon removal. RESULTS: The average duration of ICP monitoring was 7 days; the usual range was 3-15 days, with the exception of one patient who underwent monitoring for 40 days. No complications occurred during insertion of the ICP monitors. Catheter tip cultures were positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis in 7% of the children, but none developed clinical features of CNS infection. The hospital location of placement or duration of ICP monitoring did not affect the rate of catheter tips with positive cultures. There was a 13% mechanical failure rate of the fiberoptic device. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that fiberoptic ICP monitoring is safe and effective; however, there is a relatively low mechanical failure rate. Infection in uncommon despite prolonged use and there is little risk of complications associated with placement of this monitor.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics of Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH) are largely unreported in the pediatric patients in mainland of China. The main aim of this study was to recognize the clinical features of EBV-HLH in children and to explore its prognosis and risk factors. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 78 pediatric patients with EBV-HLH who were admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital between 2003 and 2008. All patients' medical records were reviewed and analyzed. For each patient, demographic, clinical, laboratory and outcome information was collected. Statistical analysis was conducted via multivariate and univariate analysis. RESULTS: The age of onset peaked between 1 - 2 years and boys were more likely developed EBV-HLH. EBV-HLH occurred mainly in the serological pattern with EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) positive (70.5%). The overall fatality of the disease was 56.7%. Twelve of the 39 fatalities (30.8%) died rapidly within 2 months after diagnosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that not receiving chemotherapy (P = 0.002), > or = 4 weeks of illness prior to diagnosis (P = 0.004), and albumin levels < 20 g/L (P = 0.045) significantly predicted an increased fatality risk. CONCLUSIONS: EBV-HLH is a severe disease with a high fatality rate that occurs mainly in the serological pattern with EBNA positive. Early initiation of chemotherapy and timely diagnosis significantly improves survival rate. Practical strategies should focus on reducing the likelihood of early death.},

This was examined in the present study by comparing the outcome of 4,041 severely head-injured children with 14,789 adults from five Level I trauma centers in the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation from 1986 to 1996. Severe head injury was defined as GCS <8, and outcome was defined by mortality. The overall mortality rate for children (<18 years) was 36.5% and for adults 47. 6%. However, for patients involved in motor vehicle accidents, there was no clinically significant difference between children age 3-11 years (35%), age 12-18 years (31.4%) and adults (32.5%). The unprecedented low mortality rate for severe head injury in children was probably due to the selection bias of the patient population. We conclude that children involved in motor vehicle accidents are just as likely to die from severe head injury as adults.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: There is debate whether primary or delayed sternal closure is the best strategy after stage 1 palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. We describe center variation in delayed sternal closure after stage 1 palliation and associated outcomes. METHODS: Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Database participants performing stage 1 palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome from 2000 to 2007 were included. We examined center variation in delayed sternal closure and compared in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay (length of stay > 6 weeks), and postoperative infection in centers with low (< or = 25% of cases), middle (26%-74% of cases), and high (> or = 75% of cases) delayed sternal closure use, adjusting for patient and center factors. RESULTS: There were 1283 patients (45 centers) included. Median age at surgery was 6 days (interquartile range, 4-9 days), and median weight at surgery was 3.2 kg (interquartile range, 2.8-3.5 kg); 59% were male. Delayed sternal closure was used in 74% of cases (range, 3%-100% of cases/center). In centers with high (n = 23) and middle (n = 17) versus low (n = 5) delayed sternal closure use, there was a greater proportion of patients with prolonged length of stay and infection, and a trend toward increased in-hospital mortality in unadjusted analysis. In multivariable analysis, there was no difference in mortality. Centers with high and middle delayed sternal closure use had prolonged length of stay (odds ratio, 2.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-5.47; P = .002 and odds ratio, 2.23; confidence interval, 1.17-4.26; P = .02, respectively) and more infection (odds ratio, 2.34; confidence interval, 1.20-4.57; P = .01 and odds ratio, 2.37; confidence interval, 1.36-4.16; P = .003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Use of delayed sternal closure after stage 1 palliation varies widely. These observational data suggest that more frequent use of delayed sternal closure is associated with longer length of stay and higher postoperative infection rates. Further evaluation of the risks and benefits of delayed sternal closure in the management of these complex infants is necessary.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Most contemporary epidemiologic studies require complex analytical methods to adjust for bias and confounding. New methods are constantly being developed, and older more established methods are yet appropriate. Careful application of statistical analysis techniques can improve causal inference of comparative treatment effects from nonrandomized studies using secondary databases. A Task Force was formed to offer a review of the more recent developments in statistical control of confounding. METHODS: The Task Force was commissioned and a chair was selected by the ISPOR Board of Directors in October 2007. This Report, the third in this issue of the journal, addressed methods to improve causal inference of treatment effects for nonrandomized studies. RESULTS: The Task Force Report recommends general analytic techniques and specific best practices where consensus is reached including: use of stratification analysis before multivariable modeling, multivariable regression including model performance and diagnostic testing, propensity scoring, instrumental variable, and structural modeling techniques including marginal structural models, where appropriate for secondary data. Sensitivity analyses and discussion of extent of residual confounding are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Valid findings of causal therapeutic benefits can be produced from nonrandomized studies using an array of state-of-the-art analytic techniques. Improving the quality and uniformity of these studies will improve the value to patients, physicians, and policymakers worldwide.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To use measures of organ dysfunction derived from administrative data to assess clinical and economic outcomes in hospitalized children. STUDY DESIGN: We used the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic and procedure codes to evaluate organ dysfunction in all patients, excluding neonates, in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database (KID). We adapted consensus clinical definitions to characterize organ dysfunction in terms of degree of impairment, type of organ system involvement, and number of dysfunctional organ systems. Univariate and multivariable models were constructed to determine the impact of organ dysfunction on in-hospital mortality and resource use. RESULTS: Patients with organ dysfunction (n=51,386) were younger and more often male than those without organ dysfunction, and they had significantly higher in-hospital mortality and resource use. Organ dysfunction, assessed in terms of degree, type, and number of dysfunctional organ systems, was consistently associated with all hospital outcomes. In multivariable models, types of organ system failures were most predictive of in-hospital mortality, whereas degree of organ system involvement allowed for a better assessment of resource use. CONCLUSIONS: Administrative data can be used to characterize multiple dimensions of organ dysfunction in children. Hospitalizations involving organ dysfunction are associated with significant clinical and economic consequences.},

We describe and quantify the secondary physiological derangement recorded in children of different ages following traumatic brain injury, and relate it to outcome at 12 months post-injury. Prospective time-series data (including intracranial pressure, arterial blood pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, oxygen saturation, temperature and heart rate) downloaded from ICU monitors, were examined to identify abnormal (i.e. outside normal age-specific limits) recordings lasting more than 5 min. Cumulated total duration of derangement was calculated for each parameter and as a percentage of the time that the ICP monitor was in situ. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression modelling was used to evaluate predictors of outcome. Age-specificity allows realistic comparisons of physiological data among children. Duration of age-specific derangement of CPP was found to predict outcome (dead v. alive: p = 0.003 and Glasgow Outcome Score 1-3 v. 4-5, i.e. poor v. independent outcome p = 0.004).},

RESEARCH DESIGN: Prospective patient series. SETTING: Tertiary care pediatric center. PATIENTS: Forty-three subjects aged 6 to 17 years hospitalized in either the pediatric or cardiovascular intensive care unit (n = 18) or on the general wards (n = 25) were recruited to participate. Subjects were excluded if their parents were unavailable for diagnostic interview or if they could not answer interview questions themselves. SELECTION PROCEDURES: Consecutive sample. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The Hospital Observed Behavior Scale, developed for this study, was used to describe objectively subjects' manifestations of anxiety, depression, delirium, and withdrawal. The Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents and Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-Parents were used to determine the presence of preexisting psychopathologic disorders. As measured by the Hospital Observed Behavior Scale, subjects in the intensive care unit exhibited apprehension, anxiety, detachment, sadness, and weeping more often than did patients in the ward. Behavior was also significantly influenced by severity of illness, duration of hospitalization, number of previous hospitalizations, and presence of a preexisting anxiety or mood disorder. We found the Hospital Observed Behavior Scale to have good interrater reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that critically ill children in the intensive care unit, children with prolonged or repeated hospitalizations, and children with preexisting anxiety and mood disorders are at greater risk than other hospitalized pediatric patients for psychological trauma and/or behavior problems that may warrant psychiatric intervention. The Hospital Observed Behavior Scale is a reliable tool to quantitate behaviors in hospitalized children.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of critically ill children with influenza A/pandemic influenza A virus (pH1N1) infection in Canada. DESIGN: An observational study of critically ill children with influenza A/pH1N1 infection in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). SETTING: Nine Canadian PICUs. PATIENTS: A total of 57 patients admitted to PICUs between April 16, 2009 and August 15, 2009. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Characteristics of critically ill children with influenza A/pH1N1 infection were recorded. Confirmed intensive care unit cases were compared with a national surveillance database containing all hospitalized pediatric patients with influenza A/pH1N1 infection. Risk factors were assessed with a Cox proportional hazard model. The PICU cohort and national surveillance data were compared, using chi-square tests. Fifty-seven children were admitted to the PICU for community-acquired influenza A/pH1N1 infection. One or more chronic comorbid illnesses were observed in 70.2% of patients, and 24.6% of patients were aboriginal. Mechanical ventilation was used in 68% of children, 20 children (35.1%) had acute lung injury on the first day of admission, and the median duration of ventilation was 6 days (range, 0-67 days). The PICU mortality rate was 7% (4 of 57 patients). When compared with nonintensive care unit hospitalized children, PICU children were more likely to have a chronic medical condition (relative risk, 1.73); aboriginal ethnicity was not a risk factor of intensive care unit admission. CONCLUSIONS: During the first outbreak of influenza A/pH1N1 infection, when the population was naive to this novel virus, severe illness was common among children with underlying chronic conditions and aboriginal children. Influenza A/pH1N1-related critical illness in children was associated with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation. However, this higher rate and severity of respiratory illness did not result in an increased mortality when compared with seasonal influenza.},

We categorized hospitals in the top decile of proportion of black patients as minority-serving. We determined the odds of readmission for black patients compared with white patients at minority-serving vs non-minority-serving hospitals.Medicare Provider Analysis Review files of more than 3.1 million Medicare fee-for-service recipients who were discharged from US hospitals in 2006-2008.Risk-adjusted odds of 30-day readmission.Overall, black patients had higher readmission rates than white patients (24.8\% vs 22.6\%, odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.14; P < .001); patients from minority-serving hospitals had higher readmission rates than those from non-minority-serving hospitals (25.5\% vs 22.0\%, OR, 1.23; 95\% CI, 1.20-1.27; P < .001). Among patients with acute MI and using white patients from non-minority-serving hospitals as the reference group (readmission rate 20.9\%), black patients from minority-serving hospitals had the highest readmission rate (26.4\%; OR, 1.35; 95\% CI, 1.28-1.42), while white patients from minority-serving hospitals had a 24.6\% readmission rate (OR, 1.23; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.29) and black patients from non-minority-serving hospitals had a 23.3\% readmission rate (OR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.16-1.23; P < .001 for each); patterns were similar for CHF and pneumonia.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Regionalization of adult critical care services may improve outcomes for critically ill patients. We sought to develop a framework for understanding clinician attitudes toward regionalization and potential barriers to developing a tiered, regionalized system of care in the United States. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews of critical care stakeholders in the United States, including physicians, nurses and hospital administrators. Stakeholders were identified from a stratified-random sample of United States general medical and surgical hospitals. Key barriers and potential solutions were identified by performing content analysis of the interview transcriptions. RESULTS: We interviewed 30 stakeholders from 24 different hospitals, representing a broad range of hospital locations and sizes. Key barriers to regionalization included personal and economic strain on families, loss of autonomy on the part of referring physicians and hospitals, loss of revenue on the part of referring physicians and hospitals, the potential to worsen outcomes at small hospitals by limiting services, and the potential to overwhelm large hospitals. Improving communication between destination and source hospitals, provider education, instituting voluntary objective criteria to become a designated referral center, and mechanisms to feed back patients and revenue to source hospitals were identified as potential solutions to some of these barriers. CONCLUSION: Regionalization efforts will be met with significant conceptual and structural barriers. These data provide a foundation for future research and can be used to inform policy decisions regarding the design and implementation of a regionalized system of critical care.},

  Abstract                 = {RATIONALE: Regionalization has been proposed as a method to improve outcomes for medical patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. OBJECTIVES: To determine the number of patients who would be affected by regionalization and the potential mortality reduction under a regionalized system of care. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study with Monte Carlo simulation, using 2001 state discharge data from eight states representing 42% of the U.S. population. Adult medical patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were identified. Patient location and hospital mortality rates were obtained from the discharge data; estimates of the relative risk reduction in hospital mortality for high-volume hospitals compared with low-volume hospitals were obtained from the published literature and applied to the cohort. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 180,976 adult medical patients who underwent mechanical ventilation at 1,170 nonfederal hospitals, 83,050 (46%) received mechanical ventilation at 887 (76%) hospitals with low annual volumes (fewer than 275 patients per year). Using published risk estimates, approximately 4,720 lives per year (95% range, 2,522-6,744) could potentially be saved in the 8 states by routinely transferring patients from low- to high-volume hospitals, representing a number needed to treat of 15.7. The median distance that patients would need to travel to reach a high-volume hospital was 8.5 miles (interquartile range, 4.0-21.2 mi). CONCLUSIONS: Regionalization of intensive care could potentially improve survival for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Transfer distances are modest for most patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Long-term acute care hospitals (LTACs) are an increasingly common discharge destination for patients recovering from intensive care. In this article the authors use U.S. Medicare claims data to examine regional- and hospital-level variation in LTAC utilization after intensive care to determine factors associated with their use. Using hierarchical regression models to control for patient characteristics, this study found wide variation in LTAC utilization across hospitals, even controlling for LTAC access within a region. Several hospital characteristics were independently associated with increasing LTAC utilization, including increasing hospital size, for-profit ownership, academic teaching status, and colocation of the LTAC within an acute care hospital. These findings highlight the need for research into LTAC admission criteria and the incentives driving variation in LTAC utilization across hospitals.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Survival of children with in-hospital cardiac arrest that does not respond to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is poor. We report on survival and early neurological outcomes of children with heart disease supported with rapid-response extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to aid cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). METHODS AND RESULTS: Children with heart disease supported with ECPR were identified from our ECMO database. Demographic, CPR, and ECMO details associated with mortality were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Pediatric overall performance category and pediatric cerebral performance category scores were assigned to ECPR survivors to assess neurological outcomes. There were 180 ECPR runs in 172 patients. Eighty-eight patients (51%) survived to discharge. Survival in patients who underwent ECPR after cardiac surgery (54%) did not differ from nonsurgical patients (46%). Survival did not vary by cardiac diagnosis and CPR duration did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors. Factors associated with mortality included noncardiac structural or chromosomal abnormalities (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.9), use of blood-primed ECMO circuit (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 1.4-36), and arterial pH <7.00 after ECMO deployment (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 2.1-17.4). Development of end-organ injury on ECMO and longer ECMO duration were associated with increased mortality. Of pediatric overall performance category/pediatric cerebral performance category scores assigned to survivors, 75% had scores </=2, indicating no to mild neurological injury. CONCLUSIONS: ECPR may promote survival in children with cardiac disease experiencing cardiac arrest unresponsive to conventional CPR with favorable early neurological outcomes. CPR duration was not associated with mortality, whereas patients with metabolic acidosis and noncardiac structural or chromosomal anomalies had higher mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the diagnostic utility of the presence and number of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bands in distinguishing bacterial from aseptic meningitis among children with CSF pleocytosis. METHODS: We identified retrospectively a cohort of children 29 days to 19 years of age with CSF pleocytosis (> or =10 x 10(6) leukocytes per L) who were treated in the emergency departments of 8 pediatric centers between January 2001 and June 2004 and whose CSF was evaluated for the presence of bands. We performed bivariate and multivariate analyses to determine the ability of CSF bands to distinguish bacterial from aseptic meningitis. RESULTS: Among 1116 children whose CSF was evaluated for the presence of bands, 48 children (4% of study patients) had bacterial meningitis. Bacterial meningitis, compared with aseptic meningitis, was associated with a greater CSF band proportion (0.03 vs 0.01; difference: 0.02; 95% confidence interval: 0.00-0.04) and CSF absolute band count (392 x 10(6) cells per L vs 3 x 10(6) cells per L; difference: 389 x 10(6) cells per L; 95% confidence interval: -77 x 10(6) cells per L to 855 x 10(6) cells per L). In addition, 29% of patients with bacterial meningitis, compared with 18% of patients with aseptic meningitis, had any bands detected in the CSF. After adjustment for other factors associated with bacterial meningitis, however, CSF band presence, CSF absolute band count, and CSF band proportion were not independently associated with bacterial meningitis. CONCLUSION: In this multicenter study, neither the presence nor quantity of CSF bands independently predicted bacterial meningitis among children with CSF pleocytosis.},

  Abstract                 = {The electrical resistivity of amorphous Fe(100-x)Zr(x) metal alloy films and multilayers has been investigated in a wide temperature and composition range. The overall behavior of the resistivity is consistent with bulk measurements, exhibiting prominent semiconductor-like changes at low temperatures. The transition from positive (metallic) to negative temperature coefficient of resistivity behavior is accompanied by minute changes in magnetoresistance and we can therefore rule out magnetic phase changes as being the cause for the observed changes in the resistivity. Using x-ray absorption and emission spectroscopies we are able to probe the unoccupied and occupied electronic densities of states. The corresponding spectra are found to significantly overlap, as expected for a metallic-like electronic structure and the absence of a band gap. Besides a broadening of the x-ray emission lines expected from an amorphous material, remarkably small differences are observed in the electronic structures when changing the amount of Zr. The resistivity data were modeled and agreement with the Mott variable range hopping model was found, indicating localized electronic states due the disordered structure of the Fe(100-x)Zr(x) alloys.},

Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions, and the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales or the Home and Community Social and Behavior Scales shortly after injury to assess preinjury functioning, and at an extended follow-up an average of 38 months postinjury. Generalized linear modeling was used to examine the relationship of age at injury to the maintenance of behavior problems, and logistic regression was used to examine the persistence of clinically significant behavior problems.At the extended follow-up, severe TBI was associated with significantly greater anxiety problems relative to the Group OI. With increasing time since injury, children who sustained a severe TBI at an earlier age had significantly higher levels of parent-reported symptoms of ADHD and anxiety than children who were older at injury.Findings suggest that longer-term treatment for behavior problems may be needed after severe TBI, particularly for those injured at an earlier age.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the pharmacoepidemiology of rituximab use in children and to estimate the frequency of infectious events within a 1-year period after rituximab exposure. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who received rituximab at 1 of 42 children's hospitals contributing data to the Pediatric Health Information System between January 1999 and June 2011. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) discharge diagnosis codes were analyzed to categorize underlying diseases (hematologic malignancies, primary immunodeficiencies, autoimmune diseases, and transplant recipients) and to estimate inpatient infectious complication rates within each category. RESULTS: A total of 2875 patients with 4639 rituximab admissions were identified. The median age at index admission was 11 years (IQR, 5-15 years). The rate of rituximab admissions increased from 3 to 185 per 100 000 admissions per year over the study interval. During the 1-year follow-up period, 463 patients (16%) died. Infectious events were assessed in 2246 of the rituximab-exposed patients; 6.1% were diagnosed with sepsis and 2.0% with septic shock. The frequency of sepsis ranged from 2.4% in patients with autoimmune diseases to 12.2% in those with primary immunodeficiencies. Three patients were assigned an ICD-9-CM discharge diagnosis code for Pneumocystis joroveci pneumonia, 1 patient was assigned an ICD-9-CM discharge diagnosis code for hepatitis B, and 1 patient was assigned an ICD-9-CM discharge diagnosis code for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. CONCLUSION: The use of rituximab has increased significantly in children with a variety of underlying diseases. Based on ICD-9-CM code data, the rates of sepsis and other life-threatening infections after rituximab exposure vary depending on the underlying condition. Based on surveillance of infection using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, the rates of opportunistic infections appear to be low.},

The cohort assembly process, which included myeloid leukemia ICD-9 discharge diagnosis codes and manual review of induction chemotherapy, was validated by chart review at a single institution. The use of ICD-9 codes alone resulted in a poor positive predictive value (PPV; 31%). Inclusion of the results from the chemotherapy review improved the PPV to 100% without compromising sensitivity (95.7%). This cohort provides a reliable source for future comparative effectiveness and clinical epidemiology studies in pediatric AML.},

  Abstract                 = {To systematically review algorithms to identify seizure, convulsion, or epilepsy cases in administrative and claims data, with a focus on studies that have examined the validity of the algorithms.A literature search was conducted using PubMed and the Iowa Drug Information Service database. Reviews were conducted by two investigators to identify studies using data sources from the USA or Canada because these data sources were most likely to reflect the coding practices of Mini-Sentinel data partners.Eleven studies that validated seizure, convulsion, or epilepsy cases were identified. All algorithms included International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 345.X (epilepsy) and either code 780.3 (convulsions) or code 780.39 (other convulsions). Six studies included 333.2 (myoclonus). In populations that included children, 779.0 (convulsions in newborn) was also fairly common. Positive predictive values (PPVs) ranged from 21\% to 98\%. Studies that used nonspecific indicators such as presence of an electroencephalogram or anti-epileptic drug (AED) level monitoring had lower PPVs. In studies focusing exclusively on epilepsy as opposed to isolated seizure events, sensitivity ranged from 70\% to 99\%.Algorithm performance was highly variable, so it is difficult to draw any strong conclusions. However, the PPVs were generally best in studies where epilepsy diagnoses were required. Using procedure codes for electroencephalograms or prescription claims for drugs possibly used for epilepsy or convulsions in the absence of a diagnostic code is not recommended. Many newer AEDs require no drug level monitoring, so requiring an AED level monitoring procedure in algorithms to identify epilepsy is not recommended.},

Causes of injury vary with child developmental age, with more inflicted injuries in infants, fall-related injuries among toddlers, sports-related injuries among middle-school-aged children and motor vehicle crashes in older children. Prevention strategies exist for some pediatric traumatic brain injury; however, all suffer from lack of compliance and enforcement. Neuropsychological and behavioral outcomes for injured children vary with the severity of injury, child age at injury, premorbid child characteristics, family factors and the families' socioeconomic status. Each of these factors needs to be taken into account when designing rehabilitation strategies and assessing factors related to outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To understand mothers' and counselors' perceptions of their roles in decision-making about resuscitation of extremely premature infants at delivery and to assess mothers' and counselors' satisfaction with the counseling and decision-making process. METHODS: Mothers who delivered an infant between 22 and 27 completed weeks of gestation and their self-identified counselor were interviewed using a structured interview format. Mothers' and counselors' perceptions of the content, tone, and directiveness of predelivery counseling and their satisfaction with the decision-making process were compared. Demographic data were collected for the mothers, infants, and counselors. Simple descriptive statistics described demographic characteristics of mothers, counselors, and infants. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to determine agreement within individual mother-counselor pairs about the content and directiveness of counseling. RESULTS: Thirty-three counselors and 15 mother-counselor pairs were interviewed. The majority (66.7%) of mothers stated that the counselor had made a treatment recommendation, and 60% stated that they had no choice in how their infant would be treated. Only 27.3% of counselors stated that they had made a recommendation, saying instead that they had described the treatment plan or offered options. Counselors believed that mothers were given a treatment choice in 57.6% of encounters. Specific mother-counselor pairs showed little correlation in their perceptions of whether a treatment recommendation had been made (R = 0.0) or a choice had been given about resuscitation (R = 0.07). Despite a lack of perceived choice, mothers generally believed that they were included in treatment decisions (66.7%) and were satisfied with the amount of influence that they had in the decision-making process (73.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The decision-making process in this study conforms most closely to a model of informed assent. Mothers may have been satisfied with this type of counseling because they felt informed and included in the decision-making process. Physicians and nurses need to elicit mothers' preferences to incorporate them into the treatment plan, as counseling about the resuscitation of extremely premature infants at delivery is considered directive by mothers even when it is not intended to be directive.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of CT of the cervical spine in addition to radiography in pediatric patients with suspected head trauma at the time of the CT head examination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 63 pediatric patients admitted to the emergency department who had head trauma and who underwent both head CT and neck radiography. Those who underwent CT of the cervical spine at the time of the head CT examination during their initial evaluation were compared for demographics, clinical status, mechanism of injury, and number of excess radiographs (number required by protocol minus number of films obtained) required to evaluate the cervical spine with those patients who did not undergo early CT of the cervical spine. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (33%) underwent cervical spine CT at the time of the head CT examination. The number of excess radiographs differed significantly between these patients (2.1 +/- 2.6 vs 3.6 +/- 2.7, p = 0.04) and the comparison group. Patients who did not undergo early CT for whom excess radiographs were obtained had the following characteristics: they were older than 8 years (p = 0.03), were unrestrained in a motor vehicle crash (p = 0.04), had a Glasgow coma score of 13-15 (p = 0.01), and were intubated (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The number of repeated radiographs required to ascertain that the cervical spine is free of injury after suspected head trauma is significantly fewer when initial CT of the neck is performed at the time of head CT examination. Including cervical spine CT in trauma protocols for subgroups of children with head injuries may lead to more effective clearance of the pediatric cervical spine.},

A total of 112 surviving children were prospectively identified, 52 (46\%) of whom had complete follow-up. Thirty-one control children were recruited from preschool settings. Control subjects were chosen to be demographically similar to case subjects. Child measures of cognition and adaptive behavior at age 3 years were measured and compared between children with and without traumatic brain injury and children with inflicted and noninflicted traumatic brain injury.Sixty percent of injured children were > 1 SD below normal on cognitive testing. Forty percent of injured children scored > 1 SD below normal on adaptive behavior testing. Children with inflicted traumatic brain injury performed more poorly on tests of cognition and adaptive behavior. Glasgow Coma Scale > or = 13, absence of seizures, income above twice the poverty guidelines, and high social capital were associated with improved outcomes. Injured children had lower scores than uninjured control children after adjustment for socioeconomic status.Very young children with mild-to-severe traumatic brain injury as measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale are at risk for global cognitive deficits more than a year after the time of injury. Inflicted brain injury is associated with more severe injury and worse outcomes. This is less optimistic than findings in this same cohort 1 year after injury. Family characteristics seem to play a role in recovery after injury.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of intracranial pressure monitors and treatments for elevated intracranial pressure in brain-injured children of <2 yrs of age and compare them with the recently published management guidelines. DESIGN: Prospective, population-based study. SETTING: All pediatric intensive care units in the state of North Carolina. PATIENTS: All patients of <24 months of age admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit with a traumatic brain injury between January 2000 and December 2001. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Use of intracranial pressure monitoring devices and treatments for elevated intracranial pressure were measured. There were 136 children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit with brain injury. A total of 54 (39.7%) had an admission Glasgow Coma Score of < or =8, and 80% were infants. Thirty-three percent of children with a Glasgow Coma Score of < or =8 received monitoring. Hyperosmolar therapy was the most frequently used treatment (57.1%). Treatment for elevated intracranial pressure was more common in, but not limited to, children with monitors. Logistic-regression modeling showed that children of < or =12 months of age had an odds ratio of 0.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.6) of receiving a monitor compared with children aged 12-24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Brain injury in young children may lead to many years of lost quality of life. The utility of monitoring intracranial pressure in infants has not been well established, which may be a reason for its low use. As most infants with traumatic brain injury survive, high-quality studies with neurodevelopmental measures as the primary outcome are urgently needed to document best practice in this subpopulation.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Diagnosing inflicted traumatic brain injury (TBI) in young children is difficult in practice. Comparisons of children with inflicted and noninflicted TBI may help to identify markers of inflicted TBI. The objective of this study was to compare inflicted and noninflicted TBI in terms of presenting complaints, clinical features, and hospital outcomes. METHODS: The presenting complaint, clinical finding, hospital course, and outcome of all children who were aged 2 years or younger in North Carolina and were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit or died with a TBI in 2000 and 2001 were reviewed. Clinical presentation and injury types were compared between children with inflicted and noninflicted TBI. Risk ratios were used to compare clinical and outcome characteristics between the 2 groups. Among survivors, multivariate binomial regression was used to examine the adjusted risk of a poor outcome dependent on injury type. RESULTS: A total of 80 (52.6%) children had inflicted and 72 (47.3%) children had noninflicted TBI. Children with noninflicted TBI (not in a motor vehicle crash) were more likely to present to the emergency department asymptomatic (44.8% vs 8.3%) and to have a specific history of trauma than children with inflicted TBI. Retinal hemorrhage, metaphyseal fracture, rib fracture, and subdural hemorrhage were more commonly found in children with inflicted compared with noninflicted TBI. Skeletal survey and ophthalmologic examination combined would have missed 8 (10.0%) inflicted TBI cases. CONCLUSIONS: Manner of presentation and injury types are helpful in distinguishing inflicted TBI. Clinicians should not rule out inflicted TBI on the basis of skeletal survey and ophthalmoscopy alone but should proceed to computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes 1 year after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) among young children and to compare outcomes between children with inflicted versus noninflicted injuries. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: All North Carolina-resident children who were hospitalized between January 2000 and December 2001 in any of the state's 9 PICUs and who survived a severe TBI that occurred on or before their second birthday were eligible to participate. Child health status, child use of ancillary medical resources, and family characteristics were determined through maternal caregiver interviews approximately 1 year after injury. Comparisons were made between family characteristics and child outcomes according to injury type. RESULTS: Seventy-two interviews of maternal caregivers were completed among 112 survivors (64.3%). Children with inflicted injuries (n = 41) had worse outcomes than did children with noninflicted injuries (n = 31), as measured with the Pediatric Outcome Performance Category and Stein-Jessup Functional Status II (Revised) tools. However, approximately 50% of children with inflicted injuries had only mild deficits or better. Children with inflicted injuries had a higher use of ancillary medical resources. Families caring for the children did not differ substantively, with a large proportion of single, working, minority mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Children with inflicted TBIs had worse outcomes than did children with other TBIs 1 year after injury. However, outcomes for these children were better than those reported previously. Many families caring for children after severe TBI are socially disadvantaged. Interventions to improve child outcomes may include enhanced family support.},

METHODS: All North Carolina-resident children who were hospitalized between January 2000 and December 2001 in any of the state's 9 PICUs and survived a TBI that occurred on or before their second birthday were eligible to participate in the prospective cohort study. Child health status, use of ancillary medical resources, and family characteristics were assessed through maternal caregiver interviews approximately 2 years after injury. Comparisons were made among injury types (inflicted versus noninflicted). RESULTS: There were 112 children who survived a TBI during the 2-year study period. Fifty-seven (79%) of the 72 maternal caregivers who had completed an interview 1 year after the child's injury participated in the year 2 interview. Most children (67%) had an outcome of mild disability or better at year 2, with 45% functioning at an age-appropriate level. Children's outcomes did not differ significantly at year 2 according to the mechanism of injury. The majority (67%) of children retained their Pediatric Overall Performance Category scores from year 1 to year 2. Children who changed were as likely to show improvement as deterioration. Children differed very little across time, as measured with the Stein-Jessup Functional Status II (Revised) scale. Families tended to have multiple environmental factors that could put their children at risk for poor developmental outcomes, including living below the poverty level (22%) and low social capital (39%). CONCLUSIONS: The children in this cohort had relatively stable functional outcomes from year 1 to year 2 after injury. This population of children remains very vulnerable to poor developmental outcomes secondary to the effects of their TBI and environmental factors.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been demonstrated that patients enrolled in clinical trials frequently have a large degree of variation in their baseline risk for the outcome of interest. Thus, some have suggested that clinical trial results should routinely be stratified by outcome risk using risk models, since the summary results may otherwise be misleading. However, variation in competing risk is another dimension of risk heterogeneity that may also underlie treatment effect heterogeneity. Understanding the effects of competing risk heterogeneity may be especially important for pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials, which seek to include traditionally excluded patients, such as the elderly or complex patients with multiple comorbidities. Indeed, the observed effect of an intervention is dependent on the ratio of outcome risk to competing risk, and these risks - which may or may not be correlated - may vary considerably in patients enrolled in a trial. Further, the effects of competing risk on treatment effect heterogeneity can be amplified by even a small degree of treatment related harm. Stratification of trial results along both the competing and the outcome risk dimensions may be necessary if pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials are to provide the clinically useful information their advocates intend.},

  Abstract                 = {Mounting evidence suggests that there is frequently considerable variation in the risk of the outcome of interest in clinical trial populations. These differences in risk will often cause clinically important heterogeneity in treatment effects (HTE) across the trial population, such that the balance between treatment risks and benefits may differ substantially between large identifiable patient subgroups; the "average" benefit observed in the summary result may even be non-representative of the treatment effect for a typical patient in the trial. Conventional subgroup analyses, which examine whether specific patient characteristics modify the effects of treatment, are usually unable to detect even large variations in treatment benefit (and harm) across risk groups because they do not account for the fact that patients have multiple characteristics simultaneously that affect the likelihood of treatment benefit. Based upon recent evidence on optimal statistical approaches to assessing HTE, we propose a framework that prioritizes the analysis and reporting of multivariate risk-based HTE and suggests that other subgroup analyses should be explicitly labeled either as primary subgroup analyses (well-motivated by prior evidence and intended to produce clinically actionable results) or secondary (exploratory) subgroup analyses (performed to inform future research). A standardized and transparent approach to HTE assessment and reporting could substantially improve clinical trial utility and interpretability.},

The main outcome measures were rehospitalization for asthma within 7, 15, 30, 60, 180, and 365 days of an index asthma admission.The rate of asthma rehospitalization ranged from 0.5\% (n = 208) at 7 days to 17.2\% (n = 7603) at 365 days. Black patients and patients with public insurance had higher odds of rehospitalization at 60 days and beyond (P ≤ .01 for both). Adolescents (12- to 18-year-old), patients with a diagnosis of a complex chronic condition, and patients with a prior year asthma admission had higher odds of rehospitalization at every time interval (P ≤ .001 for all). Significant hospital variation in case-mix adjusted rates of rehospitalization existed at each time interval (P ≤ .01 for all). Rates at 365 days were ≤ 10.9\% for the top 10\% of hospitals; if all hospitals achieved this rate, 36.6\% of rehospitalizations might have been avoided.Significant variation in asthma rehospitalization rates exists across children's hospitals from 7 to 365 days after an index admission. Racial/ethnic and economic disparities emerge at 60 days. By 1 year, rehospitalizations account for 1 in 6 hospitalizations. Assessing asthma rehospitalizations at longer intervals may augment our current understanding of and approach to post-hospitalization care improvement.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To use information about prevalence, cost, and variation in resource utilization to prioritize comparative effectiveness research topics in hospital pediatrics. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of administrative and billing data for hospital encounters. SETTING: Thirty-eight freestanding US children's hospitals from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009. PARTICIPANTS: Children hospitalized with conditions that accounted for either 80% of all encounters or 80% of all charges. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Condition-specific prevalence, total standardized cost, and interhospital variation in mean standardized cost per encounter, measured in 2 ways: (1) intraclass correlation coefficient, which represents the fraction of total variation in standardized costs per encounter due to variation between hospitals; and (2) number of outlier hospitals, defined as having more than 30% of encounters with standardized costs in either the lowest or highest quintile across all encounters. RESULTS: Among 495 conditions accounting for 80% of all charges, the 10 most expensive conditions accounted for 36% of all standardized costs. Among the 50 most prevalent and 50 most costly conditions (77 in total), 26 had intraclass correlation coefficients higher than 0.10 and 5 had intraclass correlation coefficients higher than 0.30. For 10 conditions, more than half of the hospitals met outlier hospital criteria. Surgical procedures for hypertrophy of tonsils and adenoids, otitis media, and acute appendicitis without peritonitis were high cost, were high prevalence, and displayed significant variation in interhospital cost per encounter. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed administrative and billing data can be used to standardize hospital costs and identify high-priority conditions for comparative effectiveness research--those that are high cost, are high prevalence, and demonstrate high variation in resource utilization.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to determine the cost of influenza-related hospitalization in children with community-acquired laboratory-confirmed influenza and to identify predictors of high hospitalization costs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients 21 years and younger hospitalized at a children's hospital with community-acquired laboratory-confirmed influenza during 4 consecutive influenza seasons (2000-2004). The main outcome measure was the direct medical cost of influenza-related hospitalizations, including the cost of diagnostics, therapeutics, room, and physician services. RESULTS: Electronic billing data were retrievable for 727 (98%) of 745 patients hospitalized for community-acquired laboratory-confirmed influenza during the study period. A total of 478 (66%) children were in a high-risk group for whom the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended influenza vaccine (patients with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices-designated chronic medical conditions or aged 6-23 months). The mean total cost of hospitalization for influenza-related illness was 13,159 dollars (39,792 dollars for patients admitted to an ICU; 7030 dollars for patients cared for exclusively on the wards). High-risk patients had higher mean total costs (15,269 dollars) than low-risk patients (9107 dollars). Cardiac, metabolic, and neurologic/neuromuscular diseases and age of 18 to 21 years were independently associated with the highest hospitalization costs (>15th percentile). CONCLUSIONS: The cost of influenza-related hospitalizations in children may be considerably higher than previously estimated. The presence of certain Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices-designated chronic medical conditions is associated with higher influenza-related hospitalization costs. Successfully immunizing patients with these conditions has the potential for significant cost savings.},

  Abstract                 = {A series of experiments were performed to investigate why two peaks (D and E) of the five dissolved phase peaks in hyperpolarized (129)Xe rat head spectra appeared inconsistently in previous work. Specifically, spectra were acquired under conditions of various shim states, anaesthetics, and arterial ligation. The shimming experiments showed that slice-shimming can be used to improve resolution of the dissolved phase peaks, but even so, subtle changes in the shim state that may dramatically alter the shape of peak E remain poorly understood. Also, the inability to shim gas spaces and tissue simultaneously may explain why inconsistent chemical shift values have been reported in the literature. A possible solution for this problem is suggested. The results of pre- and postligation spectra from the same animal indicated that two peaks (A and E) originate from brain. Changing the anaesthetic was found to have no effect on the number of dissolved peaks in xenon spectra.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECT: Quality improvement techniques are being implemented in many areas of medicine. In an effort to reduce the ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection rate, a standardized protocol was developed and implemented at 4 centers of the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (HCRN). METHODS: The protocol was developed sequentially by HCRN members using the current literature and prior institutional experience until consensus was obtained. The protocol was prospectively applied at each HCRN center to all children undergoing a shunt insertion or revision procedure. Infections were defined on the basis of CSF, wound, or pseudocyst cultures; wound breakdown; abdominal pseudocyst; or positive blood cultures in the presence of a ventriculoatrial shunt. Procedures and infections were measured before and after protocol implementation. RESULTS: Twenty-one surgeons at 4 centers performed 1571 procedures between June 1, 2007, and February 28, 2009. The minimum follow-up was 6 months. The Network infection rate decreased from 8.8% prior to the protocol to 5.7% while using the protocol (p = 0.0028, absolute risk reduction 3.15%, relative risk reduction 36%). Three of 4 centers lowered their infection rate. Shunt surgery after external ventricular drainage (with or without prior infection) had the highest infection rate. Overall protocol compliance was 74.5% and improved over the course of the observation period. Based on logistic regression analysis, the use of BioGlide catheters (odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% CI 1.19-3.05; p = 0.007) and the use of antiseptic cream by any members of the surgical team (instead of a formal surgical scrub by all members of the surgical team; OR 4.53, 95% CI 1.43-14.41; p = 0.01) were associated with an increased risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS: The standardized protocol for shunt surgery significantly reduced shunt infection across the HCRN. Overall protocol compliance was good. The protocol has established a common baseline within the Network, which will facilitate assessment of new treatments. Identification of factors associated with infection will allow further protocol refinement in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {Health care systems, payers, and hospitals use hospital readmission rates as a measure of quality. Although hospitals can track readmissions back to themselves (hospital A to hospital A), they lack information when their patients are readmitted to different hospitals (hospital A to hospital B). Because hospitals lack different-hospital readmission (DHR) data, they may underestimate all-hospital readmission (AHR) rates (hospital A to hospital A or B).To determine the prevalence of 30-day pediatric DHRs; to assess the effect of DHR on readmission performance; and to identify patient and hospital characteristics associated with DHR.We analyzed all-payer inpatient claims for 701 263 pediatric discharges (patients aged 0-17 years) from 177 acute care hospitals in New York State from January 1, 2005, through November 30, 2009, to identify 30-day same-hospital readmissions (SHRs), DHRs, and AHRs. Data analysis was performed from March 12, 2013, through April 6, 2015. We compared excess readmission ratios (calculated per the Medicare formula) using SHRs and AHRs to determine what might happen if the federal formula were applied to a specific state and to evaluate how often hospitals might accurately anticipate-using data available to them-whether they would incur penalties (excess readmission ratio >1) for readmissions. Using multivariate logistic regression, we identified patient- and hospital-level predictors of DHR vs SHR.The proportion of DHRs vs SHRs, AHR and SHR rates, and excess readmissions.Different-hospital readmissions constituted 13.9\% of 31 325 AHRs. At the individual hospital level, the median (interquartile range) percentage of DHRs was 21.6\% (12.8\%-39.1\%). The median (interquartile range) adjusted AHR rate was 3.4\% (3.0\%-4.1\%), 38.9\% higher than the median adjusted SHR rate of 2.5\% (2.0\%-3.4\%) (P < .001). Excess readmission ratios using SHRs inaccurately anticipated penalties (changed from >1 to ≤1 or vice versa) for 20 of the 177 hospitals (11.3\%); all were nonchildren's hospitals and 18 of 20 (90.0\%) were nonteaching hospitals. Characteristics associated with higher odds ratios (ORs) (reported with 95\% CIs) of DHR in multivariate analyses included being younger (compared with age <1 year, ORs [95\% CIs] for the other age categories ranged from 0.76 [0.66-0.88] to 0.85 [0.73-0.99]); being white (ORs [95\% CIs] for nonwhite race/ethnicity ranged from 0.74 [0.65-0.84] to 0.88 [0.79-0.99]); having private insurance (1.14 [1.04-1.24]); having a chronic condition indicator for a mental disorder (1.33 [1.13-1.56]) or a disease of the nervous system (1.37 [1.20-1.57]) or circulatory system (1.20 [1.00-1.43]); and admission to a nonchildren's (1.62 [1.01-2.60]), urban (ORs for nonurban hospitals ranged from 0.35 [0.24-0.52] to 0.36 [0.21-0.64]), or lower-volume (0.73 [0.64-0.84]) hospital (P < .05 for each).Different-hospital readmissions differentially affect hospitals' pediatric readmission rates and anticipated performance, making SHRs an incomplete surrogate for AHRs-particularly for certain hospital types. Failing to incorporate DHRs into readmission measurement may impede quality assessment, anticipation of penalties, and quality improvement.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of prolonged infusion of 3% hypertonic saline (514 mEq/L) and sustained hypernatremia on refractory intracranial hypertension in pediatric traumatic brain injury patients. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: A 24-bed Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (Level III) at Children's Hospital. PATIENTS: We present ten children with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) resistant to conventional therapy (head elevation at 30 degrees, normothermia, sedation, paralysis and analgesia, osmolar therapy with mannitol, loop diuretic, external ventricular drainage in five patients), controlled hyperventilation (Pco2, 28-35 mm Hg), and barbiturate coma. We continuously monitored ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, serum sodium concentrations, serum osmolarity, and serum creatinine. INTERVENTIONS: A continuous infusion of 3% saline on a sliding scale was used to achieve a target serum sodium level that would maintain ICP <20 mm Hg once the conventional therapy and barbiturate coma as outlined above failed to control intracranial hypertension. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean duration of treatment with 3% saline was 7.6 days (range, 4-18 days). The mean highest serum sodium was 170.7 mEq/L (range, 157-187 mEq/L). The mean highest serum osmolarity was 364.8 mosm/L (range, 330-431 mosm/L). The mean highest serum creatinine was 1.31 mg/dL (range, 0.4-5.0 mg/dL). There was a steady increase in serum sodium versus time zero that reached statistical significance at 24, 48, and 72 hrs (p < .01). There was a statistically significant decrease in ICP spike frequency at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs (p < .01). There was a statistically significant increase in CPP versus time zero at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs (p < .01). There was a statistically significant increase in serum osmolarity versus time zero at 12 hrs (p < .05) and at 24, 48, and 72 hrs (p < .01). Two patients developed acute renal failure and required continuous veno-venous hemodialysis; these were concurrent with an episode of sepsis and multisystem organ dysfunction. Both recovered full renal function with no electrolyte abnormalities at the time of discharge. CONCLUSION: An increase in serum sodium concentration significantly decreases ICP and increases CPP. Hypertonic saline is an effective agent to increase serum sodium concentrations. Sustained hypernatremia and hyperosmolarity are safely tolerated in pediatric patients with traumatic brain injury. Controlled trials are needed before recommendation of widespread use.},

  Abstract                 = {Vascular catheters are associated with complications such as infection, thrombosis and stenosis. The embolization of a venous catheter fragment is a rare complication. A 39-year-old woman underwent placement of a totally implantable venous access device for chemotherapy to treat a recurrent liposarcoma of the left thigh. The "pinch-off sign" was noted on a routine chest X-ray but that was ignored. Three-months after implantation of the intravenous access device, the indwelling central catheter was fractured and embolized to the pulmonary trunk. The catheter in the pulmonary trunk was successfully removed through a percutaneous femoral vein approach using a pigtail catheter and goose neck snare.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Suture reformation after strip craniectomy for nonsyndromic sagittal synostosis remains an inconsistent and underreported phenomenon. Although several theories have been proposed to account for the fate of the cranial defect, no explanation accurately matches clinical experience with the appearance of reformed sutures, ectopic sutures, and complete defect ossification postoperatively. METHODS AND RESULTS: We review the case of a 7-year-old boy who formed a parasagittal suture at the defect margin after strip craniectomy for nonsyndromic sagittal synostosis. We review the literature and the clinical experiences of previous authors. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of suture reformation and the biomechanical forces shaping suture formation are still poorly understood. Previous reports of postoperative suture reformation offer inconclusive evidence as to whether a pathologic suture, an abnormal cranial base, or a combination of biomechanical forces plays the larger role. It remains an open question as to whether a single underlying mechanism can explain suture reformation or if there are instead multiple causes.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Variability in phenotypic characterization of coronary artery disease (CAD) may contribute to the heterogeneity of genetic association studies, and more consistency in phenotype definitions might improve replication of genetic associations. We assessed the extent of phenotypic heterogeneity and quantified its impact in a large literature sample of association studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched for large (>/=15 studies) meta-analyses of genetic associations and reviewed all studies included therein. From each primary study, we extracted phenotypic definitions, demographics, study design characteristics, and genotypic data. For each association, we assessed the magnitude and heterogeneity of genetic effects within and across CAD phenotypes, using meta-analytic methodologies. A total of 965 individual studies investigating 32 distinct variants in 22 genes were included, from which we grouped CAD phenotypes into 3 categories: acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (426 [44%] studies); angiographically documented disease (323 [34%] studies); and broad, not otherwise specified CAD (216 [22%] studies). These clinical phenotypes were overlapping. Subgroup meta-analyses by phenotype showed discordant results, but phenotypic classification generally explained small proportions of between-study heterogeneity. Differences between phenotypic groups were minimized for associations with robust statistical support. No CAD phenotype was consistently associated with larger or more homogeneous genetic effects in meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial phenotypic heterogeneity exists in CAD genetic associations, but differences in phenotype definition make a small contribution to between-study heterogeneity. We did not find a consistent effect in terms of the magnitude or homogeneity of summary effects for a specific phenotype to support its preferential use in genetic studies or meta-analyses for CAD.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Objectives of the Pediatric Emergency Research Network's (PERN's) meeting included (1) learn about each of the participating network's missions, goals, and infrastructure; (2) share important contributions each network has made to the creation of new knowledge; (3) discuss "best practices" to improve each network's effectiveness; and (4) explore the potential for a collaborative research project as proof of concept that would help us promote quality of care of the acutely ill and injured child/youth globally. METHODS: In October 2009, a multiday meeting was attended by 18 delegates representing the following pediatric emergency medicine research networks: Pediatric Emergency Medicine Collaborative Research Committee (United States), Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (United States), Pediatric Emergency Research of Canada (Canada), Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (Australia and New Zealand), and Research in European Pediatric Emergency Medicine (15 countries in Europe and the Middle East). RESULTS: The inaugural meeting of PERN demonstrated that there is a common desire for high-quality research and the dissemination of this research to improve health and outcomes of acutely ill and injured children and youths throughout the world. Presently, the PERN group is in the final stages of developing a protocol to assess H1N1 risk factors with the collection of retrospective data. CONCLUSIONS: Several members of PERN will be gathering at the International Conference on Emergency Medicine in Singapore, where the group will be presenting information about the H1N1 initiative. The PERN group is planning to bring together all 5 networks later in 2010 to discuss future global collaborations.},

The purpose of this study was to identify systematic errors in either the initial evaluation or care of burn patients requiring transport more than 90 miles to a single regional burn center. Therefore, we undertook a descriptive analysis of patients transported more than 90 miles to a single regional burn center from 2000 to 2003. The outcomes of interest were duration of transport, errors in burn size estimation, errors in fluid management, appropriateness of intubation, and complications during transport. During the years 2000 to 2003, there were 1877 admissions to the burn center; 949 (51%) were transferred from an outside facility. Of these 949, 424 (45%) were transferred more than 90 miles from a referring facility to our burn center. The average transport time from injury to our burn center was 7.2 hours (range, 1.6-48). There were no patient deaths during transport, and the most common complications were loss of or inability to secure intravenous access and inability to secure an airway. Burn size estimates differed significantly (P < .001) between referring providers and burn center physicians. This study confirms that patients can be transported safely and efficiently over long distances to a regional burn center. Given the current geographic distribution of burn centers and concerns about declining numbers of burn surgeons, organized systems of patient triage and transport may become increasingly important.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: The delivery of burn care is a resource-intensive endeavor that requires specialized personnel and equipment. The optimal geographic distribution of burn centers has long been debated; however, the current distribution of centers relative to geographic area and population is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the proportion of the US population living within 1 and 2 hours by rotary air transport (helicopter) or ground transport of a burn care facility. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional analysis of geographic access to US burn centers utilizing the 2000 US census, road and speed limit data, the Atlas and Database of Air Medical Services database, and the 2008 American Burn Association Directory. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The proportion of state, regional, and national population living within 1 and 2 hours by air transport or ground transport of a burn care facility. RESULTS: In 2008, there were 128 self-reported burn centers in the United States including 51 American Burn Association-verified centers. An estimated 25.1% and 46.3% of the US population live within 1 and 2 hours by ground transport, respectively, of a verified burn center. By air, 53.9% and 79.0% of the population live within 1 and 2 hours, respectively, of a verified center. There was significant regional variation in access to verified burn centers by both ground and rotary air transport. The greatest proportion of the population with access was highest in the northeast region and lowest in the southern United States. CONCLUSION: Nearly 80% of the US population lives within 2 hours by ground or rotary air transport of a verified burn center; however, there is both state and regional variation in geographic access to these centers.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: As the epidemiology of infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) changes, accurate information on the scope and magnitude of MRSA infections in the US population is needed. OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence and distribution of invasive MRSA disease in 9 US communities and to estimate the burden of invasive MRSA infections in the United States in 2005. DESIGN AND SETTING: Active, population-based surveillance for invasive MRSA in 9 sites participating in the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs)/Emerging Infections Program Network from July 2004 through December 2005. Reports of MRSA were investigated and classified as either health care-associated (either hospital-onset or community-onset) or community-associated (patients without established health care risk factors for MRSA). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence rates and estimated number of invasive MRSA infections and in-hospital deaths among patients with MRSA in the United States in 2005; interval estimates of incidence excluding 1 site that appeared to be an outlier with the highest incidence; molecular characterization of infecting strains. RESULTS: There were 8987 observed cases of invasive MRSA reported during the surveillance period. Most MRSA infections were health care-associated: 5250 (58.4%) were community-onset infections, 2389 (26.6%) were hospital-onset infections; 1234 (13.7%) were community-associated infections, and 114 (1.3%) could not be classified. In 2005, the standardized incidence rate of invasive MRSA was 31.8 per 100,000 (interval estimate, 24.4-35.2). Incidence rates were highest among persons 65 years and older (127.7 per 100,000; interval estimate, 92.6-156.9), blacks (66.5 per 100,000; interval estimate, 43.5-63.1), and males (37.5 per 100,000; interval estimate, 26.8-39.5). There were 1598 in-hospital deaths among patients with MRSA infection during the surveillance period. In 2005, the standardized mortality rate was 6.3 per 100,000 (interval estimate, 3.3-7.5). Molecular testing identified strains historically associated with community-associated disease outbreaks recovered from cultures in both hospital-onset and community-onset health care-associated infections in all surveillance areas. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive MRSA infection affects certain populations disproportionately. It is a major public health problem primarily related to health care but no longer confined to intensive care units, acute care hospitals, or any health care institution.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the prevalence and nature of physical and neurocognitive sequelae in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) survivors. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective follow-up study 3 months after discharge from a 14-bed tertiary PICU in The Netherlands. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: The families of 250 previously healthy children unexpectedly admitted to the PICU were invited to visit the outpatient follow-up clinic for structured medical examination of the child 3 months after discharge; 186 patients were evaluated. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) and Pediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC) values were determined at PICU discharge, at the outpatient follow-up clinic, and retrospectively before admission to the PICU. We found that 69% of children had physical sequelae. In 30% of cases these were caused by a previously unknown illness and in 39% by acquired morbidity. In 8% of the children the acquired morbidity was related to complications from PICU procedures. Three months after discharge 77% of the children had normal PCPC scores and 31% had normal POPC scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that PICU survival may be associated with substantial physical sequelae. Structured follow-up research, preferably by multicenter studies, is warranted in PICU survivors.},

  Abstract                 = {The number of births in the United States decreased by 3% between 2008 and 2009 to 4 130 665 births. The general fertility rate also declined 3% to 66.7 per 1000 women. The teenage birth rate fell 6% to 39.1 per 1000. Birth rates also declined for women 20 to 39 years and for all 5-year groups, but the rate for women 40 to 44 years continued to rise. The percentage of all births to unmarried women increased to 41.0% in 2009, up from 40.6% in 2008. In 2009, 32.9% of all births occurred by cesarean delivery, continuing its rise. The 2009 preterm birth rate declined for the third year in a row to 12.18%. The low-birth-weight rate was unchanged in 2009 at 8.16%. Both twin and triplet and higher order birth rates increased. The infant mortality rate was 6.42 infant deaths per 1000 live births in 2009. The rate is significantly lower than the rate of 6.61 in 2008. Linked birth and infant death data from 2007 showed that non-Hispanic black infants continued to have much higher mortality rates than non-Hispanic white and Hispanic infants. Life expectancy at birth was 78.2 years in 2009. Crude death rates for children and adolescents aged 1 to 19 years decreased by 6.5% between 2008 and 2009. Unintentional injuries and homicide, the first and second leading causes of death jointly accounted for 48.6% of all deaths to children and adolescents in 2009.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to assess the mechanisms and patterns of injury and outcome in children with cervical (C) spine trauma. METHODS: We reviewed the National Pediatric Trauma Registry between April 1994 and March 1999 and identified (by ICD-9 criteria) all cases of blunt trauma victims with cervical fractures, dislocations, and spinal cord injuries without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA). Data are shown as mean +/- SEM. RESULTS: During the 5-year period, the incidence of blunt C-spine injury was 1.6% (n = 408 of 24,740 total entries). Mean age was 10.5+/-0.3 (1 to 20) years, and 59% were boys. Leading mechanisms were motor vehicle accidents (n = 179; 44%), sports (n = 66; 16%), and pedestrian injuries (n = 57, 14%). Younger (< or =10 years) children more often sustained high (C1 to C4) vs low (C5 to C7) injuries (85% v 57%; P<.01) and also had a higher incidence of dislocations (31% v 20%; P<.01) and cord injuries (26% v 14%; P<.01), whereas older children had more C-spine fractures (66% v 43%; P<0.01). Mortality rates (overall, 17%) were higher in younger children (n = 180) when compared with older children (n = 228; 30% v 7%; P<.01). Overall, the majority of deaths (93%) were associated with brain injuries. No children with cervical dislocations had neurologic sequelae. The preponderance of children with fractures (83%) also were without neurologic injury, whereas those associated with SCIWORA usually were (80%) partial. Overall, complete cord lesions were infrequent (4%). CONCLUSIONS: These data, representing the largest series to date, confirm that blunt C-spine injuries in children are rare. Patterns of injury vary significantly according to child age. Major neurologic sequelae in survivors is uncommon, does not correlate well with cord level, and rarely is complete.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine the morbidity associated with hypotension in the resuscitative phase of pediatric head trauma. METHODS: A retrospective review (1990 to 1995) was performed at a level-1 pediatric trauma facility. Inclusion criteria included a Glasgow coma score (GCS) of 6 to 8 and absence of penetrating trauma or bleeding disorders. The GCS was assigned using a postresuscitation examination by a neurosurgeon. Hypotension was defined as a blood pressure reading of less than the fifth percentile for age that lasted longer than 5 minutes. Episodes were monitored from the onset of injury through the first 24 hours of hospitalization. Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) was assigned based on a 3-month follow-up evaluation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and contingency table analysis were performed on all groups, and a P value of less than .05 was taken to represent statistical significance. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients met inclusion criteria. They had a mean GCS of 7.2 and a mean age of 6 years; 97% survived. Early hypotension was associated with worse neurological outcome (GOS) and prolonged hospitalization. There was no significant correlation between GOS and age, gender, injury mechanism, associated injuries, or transport time. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that maintaining adequate blood pressure during the early resuscitation of pediatric blunt head trauma patients may improve neurological outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has been used for over two decades in select patients after cardiac surgery. We previously described factors associated with death in this population. We now review our recent experience to reassess factors related to mortality. METHODS: All pediatric patients who received ECLS support within 7 days after surgery between July 1995 and June 2001 were examined to describe clinical features associated with survival. We compared the results with our prior report to assess changes in practice and outcome. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were followed. Fifty percent survived to discharge. Hospital survival was not significantly related to patient age, cannulation site, or indication. Thirty-five percent of patients required hemofiltration while on ECLS and were significantly less likely to survive (23% vs 65%). A multivariate analysis combining all children from our prior report with the present cohort revealed that patients who received hemofiltration were five times more likely to die (odds ratio 5.01, 95% confidence interval 2.11-11.88). Children with an adequate two-ventricular repair had lower risk of death (odds ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.91) after adjusting for patient age, study period, and hours elapsed before initiation of ECLS after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with an adequate two-ventricle repair have significantly higher hospital survival, whereas those with single ventricle physiology or need for dialysis have decreased survival.},

DESIGN: Review of existing literature and national data regarding DCD. SETTING: Three children's hospitals and a national organ procurement network. PATIENTS: Nationwide review of pediatric candidates for transplantation and pediatric DCD donors. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Interest in DCD has greatly increased over the past several years due to limited organ availability for transplantation. Leading medical groups have evaluated and endorsed DCD, and more hospitals are offering DCD as part of end-of-life care options for dying patients and to increase donation. Children's hospitals need to evaluate this concept and develop ethically sound polices to meet the needs of patients and families. Preliminary reports regarding organ function from DCD donors are promising, and DCD is increasing. CONCLUSIONS: The widening gap between the need for organs and the availability of organs from brain-dead donors has led to a resurgence of both interest in and use of organs donated after cardiac death. Children's hospitals need to explore DCD as an option in select circumstances to serve grieving families who would like to donate and to increase organ availability for transplantation. DCD programs are dependent on input and support from critical care providers.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic minority patients often receive differential medical care compared to Caucasians. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of race and ethnicity with rates of alcohol and drug testing among adult US trauma patients. METHODS: Data for 79,246 adults admitted to 58 institutions participating in the US National Trauma Data Bank were evaluated using multivariable, hierarchical, mixed-effects analyses to determine the odds of receiving alcohol and drug testing among different racial/ethnic groups. The primary outcome variable was whether an alcohol or drug test was performed. The secondary outcome variable was the results of those tests. Participants were stratified by injury severity using the Injury Severity Score. Additional case-mix variables included: gender, age, Glasgow Coma Scale, day and time of arrival, and payment source. RESULTS: Black and Hispanic males in all injury severity groups were tested for alcohol more frequently than Caucasian males (odds ratio for Black men 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.16-1.47; and for Hispanic men 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.19-1.77, in the moderate injury group). Hispanic males in the moderate injury group were also tested for drugs more frequently then Caucasian males (odds ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.09-1.63). CONCLUSION: Racial and ethnic minority trauma patients in the US are tested for alcohol and drugs at higher rates after adjusting for potential confounders. Because having a positive alcohol or drug test can adversely affect a patient's medical care, differential testing that is racially or ethnically biased may place minority patients at risk of receiving disparate care.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship of body mass index (BMI) and BMI changes during adulthood to lung cancer mortality in a large-sized Japanese cohort. METHODS: We followed 29,350 men for a maximum of 11 years in the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study for Evaluation of Cancer Risk (JACC Study), which was initiated from 1988 to 1990. Complementary log-log modeling was employed with age, smoking status, and family history of lung cancer as covariates. Anthropometric measurements used were BMI at baseline, BMI around age 20, and adulthood BMI loss defined between the two measurements. Independent effects of these three measurements on lung cancer mortality were evaluated by applying the method of generalized estimation equations to the model for adjustment of intra-individual correlation. RESULTS: Never smokers showed that high BMI both at baseline and around age 20 significantly predict lung cancer mortality (P < 0.05). Adulthood BMI loss significantly (P < 0.05) elevated the risk for lung cancer mortality among current smokers, implying their enhanced vulnerability to lung cancer risk among smokers. CONCLUSIONS: The risk for lung cancer mortality is elevated by a mechanism related to smoking-induced weight loss during adulthood.},

  Abstract                 = {This study retrospectively evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of 3 cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and osteopontin, according to tumor grade in 125 surgically resected specimens of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aims of this study were to identify factors associated with vascular invasion and to elucidate the prognostic value of CAMs. The median follow-up time was 110 months. The levels of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and osteopontin immunoreactivity were significantly associated with Edmondson-Steiner grade but not with tumor size. There was increased loss of E-cadherin, nonnuclear overexpression of beta-catenin, and overexpression of osteopontin in tumors of higher histologic grade. Vascular invasion was found in 44 (35%) of 125 resected specimens. Logistic regression analysis identified 3 tumor-related factors that were independently associated with vascular invasion-tumor size more than 3 cm, Edmondson-Steiner grades III to IV, and overexpression of osteopontin. Among the tested CAMs, osteopontin (P = .0110) and E-cadherin (P = .0287) were significant prognostic factors by univariate analysis. The Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that Edmondson-Steiner grades III to IV (relative risk [RR], 3.028; P < .001), the presence of vascular invasion (RR, 1.964; P = .011), overexpression of osteopontin (RR, 1.755; P = .034), serum alpha-fetoprotein level more than 20 ng/mL (RR, 1.834; P = .037), and Child-Pugh classification B to C (RR, 1.880; P = .040) were found to be independently significant factors associated with survival after hepatectomy. These results suggest that overexpression of osteopontin independently correlates with vascular invasion and thus predicts poor survival for patients with HCC, whereas aberrant expression of E-cadherin or beta-catenin does not.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: D2-40 monoclonal antibody immunoreactivity is specific for lymphatic endothelium and therefore provides a marker of lymphatic invasion. We hypothesized that intrahepatic lymphatic invasion reflects the nodal status of colorectal carcinoma liver metastases and may function as an adverse prognostic factor. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 105 consecutive patients who underwent resection for colorectal carcinoma liver metastases was conducted. Intrahepatic lymphatic invasion was declared when either single tumor cells or cell clusters were clearly visible within vessels that showed immunoreactivity for D2-40 monoclonal antibody. The median follow-up time was 124 months. RESULTS: Of 105 patients, 13 were classified as having intrahepatic lymphatic invasion. All tumor foci of intrahepatic lymphatic invasion were detected within the portal tracts. Intrahepatic lymphatic invasion was significantly associated with hepatic lymph node involvement (P = 0.039). Survival after resection was significantly worse in patients with intrahepatic lymphatic invasion (median survival time of 13 months; cumulative five-year survival rate of 0%) than in patients without (median survival time of 40 months; cumulative five-year survival rate of 41%; P < 0.0001). Patients with intrahepatic lymphatic invasion also showed decreased disease-free survival rates (P < 0.0001). Intrahepatic lymphatic invasion thus independently affected both survival (relative risk, 7.666; 95% confidence interval, 3.732-15.748; P < 0.001) and disease-free survival (relative risk, 4.112; 95% confidence interval, 2.185-7.738; P < 0.001).

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES. The assessment of the adequacy of prenatal care utilization is heavily shaped by the way in which utilization is measured. Although it is widely used, the current major index of utilization, the Kessner/Institute of Medicine Index, has not been subjected to systematic examination. This paper provides such an examination. METHODS. Data from the 1980 National Natality Survey are used to disaggregate the components of the Kessner Index for detailed analysis. An alternative two-part index, the Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index, is proposed that combines independent assessments of the timing of prenatal care initiation and the frequency of visits received after initiation. RESULTS. The Kessner Index is seriously flawed. It is heavily weighted toward timing of prenatal care initiation does not distinguish timing of initiation from poor subsequent utilization, inaccurately measures utilization for full- or post-term pregnancies, and lacks sufficient documentation for consistent computer programming. CONCLUSIONS. The Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index offers a more accurate and comprehensive set of measures of prenatal care utilization than the Kessner Index.},

  Abstract                 = {Acute brain injury is the cause of approximately 100,000 pediatric hospital admissions per year in the United States. This report examines the nature of the brain injury, clinical diagnosis, hospital course, and discharge outcome of all pediatric cases in the population of San Diego County, California, for 1981 (N = 709). Brain-injured children were identified from hospital records, death certificates, and coroners' records. Severity of injury was determined using the Abbreviated Injury Scale and the Glasgow Coma Scale. Three percent of brain-injured children died at the accident site; an additional 3% died in the hospital. All in-hospital deaths occurred among the 5% of children with Glascow Coma Scale scores of 8 or less, and in this group the case fatality rate was 59%. Fractures of the skull, present in 23% of cases, seemed to be associated with excess mortality even after type of lesion was considered. Type of lesion, but not presence or absence of a skull fracture, had some predictive power for disability among survivors. Concussion was the most frequent diagnosis. Mildly brain-injured children accounted for 93% of all cases and about 90% of all hospital days.},

  Abstract                 = {Cervical spine injury in pediatric trauma occurs rarely; however, there is significant potential for considerable morbidity when it does occur. Screening for cervical spine injuries has been shown to be most sensitive in adult trauma centers when combined with reliable physical examination findings. Because pediatric trauma patients suffer from a different range of injuries than adults, and often are not reliable due to age limitations or associated head injury, the same strategies employed in adult trauma do not always hold true in children. We look at the differences in adult and pediatric cervical spine anatomy and traumatic mechanisms, as well as the differences between cervical spine injury in infants/children and adolescents/teens. In addition, we examine the literature currently available in each population and derive consensuses on the issues that are important in managing the pediatric cervical spine. We hope to provide a framework that trauma centers can use to develop safe and effective cervical spine clearance protocols.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the risk of SBIs in febrile infants with influenza virus infections and compare this risk with that of febrile infants without influenza infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, cross-sectional study during 3 consecutive influenza seasons. All febrile infants <or=60 days of age evaluated at any of 5 participating pediatric EDs between October and March of 1998 through 2001 were eligible. We determined influenza virus status by rapid antigen detection. We evaluated infants with blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and stool cultures. Urinary tract infection (UTI) was defined by single-pathogen growth of either >or=5 x 10(4) colony-forming units per mL or >or=10(4) colony-forming units per mL in association with a positive urinalysis. Bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, and bacterial enteritis were defined by growth of a known bacterial pathogen. SBI was defined as any of the 4 above-mentioned bacterial infections. RESULTS: During the 3-year study period, 1091 infants were enrolled. A total of 844 (77.4%) infants were tested for the influenza virus, of whom 123 (14.3%) tested positive. SBI status was determined in 809 (95.9%) of the 844 infants. Overall, 95 (11.7%) of the 809 infants tested for influenza virus had an SBI. Infants with influenza infections had a significantly lower prevalence of SBI (2.5%) and UTI (2.4%) when compared with infants who tested negative for the influenza virus. Although there were no cases of bacteremia, meningitis, or enteritis in the influenza-positive group, the differences between the 2 groups for these individual infections were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Febrile infants <or=60 days of age with influenza infections are at significantly lower risk of SBIs than febrile infants who are influenza-negative. Nevertheless, the rate of UTI remains appreciable in febrile, influenza-positive infants.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND. Most US medical records lack socioeconomic data, hindering studies of social gradients in health and ascertainment of whether study samples are representative of the general population. This study assessed the validity of a census-based approach in addressing these problems. METHODS. Socioeconomic data from 1980 census tracts and block groups were matched to the 1985 membership records of a large prepaid health plan (n = 1.9 million), with the link provided by each individual's residential address. Among a subset of 14,420 Black and White members, comparisons were made of the association of individual, census tract, and census block-group socioeconomic measures with hypertension, height, smoking, and reproductive history. RESULTS. Census-level and individual-level socioeconomic measures were similarly associated with the selected health outcomes. Census data permitted assessing response bias due to missing individual-level socioeconomic data and also contextual effects involving the interaction of individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic traits. On the basis of block-group characteristics, health plan members generally were representative of the total population; persons in impoverished neighborhoods, however, were underrepresented. CONCLUSIONS. This census-based methodology offers a valid and useful approach to overcoming the absence of socioeconomic data in most US medical records.},

Routine analysis using conceptually coherent and consistent measures of socioeconomic position in US public health research and surveillance, however, remains rare. This review discusses concepts and methodologies concerning, and guidelines for measuring, social class and other aspects of socioeconomic position (e.g. income, poverty, deprivation, wealth, education). These data should be collected at the individual, household, and neighborhood level, to characterize both childhood and adult socioeconomic position; fluctuations in economic resources during these time periods also merit consideration. Guidelines for linking census-based socioeconomic measures and health data are presented, as are recommendations for analyses involving social class, race/ethnicity, and gender. Suggestions for research on socioeconomic measures are provided, to aid monitoring steps toward social equity in health.},

  Abstract                 = {Providing large numbers of general education students with an introduction to science is a challenge. To meet this challenge, a quarter-long neurophysiology project was developed for use in an introductory biology course. The primary goals of this multistep project were to introduce students to the scientific method, scientific writing, on-line scientific bibliographic databases, and the scientific literature, while improving their academic literacy skills. Students began by collecting data on their own circadian rhythms in autonomic, motor, and cognitive function, reliably demonstrating the predicted circadian changes in heart rate, eye-hand coordination, and adding speed. Students wrote a journal-style article using pooled class data. Students were prepared to write the paper by several methods that were designed to improve academic language skills, including a library training exercise, "modeling" of the writing assignment, and drafting of subsections of the paper. This multistep neurophysiology project represents a significant commitment of time by both students and instructors, but produces a valuable finished product and ideally gives introductory students a positive first experience with science.},

Two patients experienced posttraumatic seizure, 1 in each group. Sixty-eight patients survived to hospital discharge; 65\% received prophylactic AED greater than 7 days. Ninety-eight percent of 81 patients admitted between 2000 and 2007 received PHT, whereas 64\% of 28 patients admitted between 2008 and 2010 received LEV.Only 2 patients experienced posttraumatic seizure after receiving AED, indicating low incidence.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and impact on mortality of delays in initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy from initial onset of recurrent/persistent hypotension of septic shock. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study performed between July 1989 and June 2004. SETTING: Fourteen intensive care units (four medical, four surgical, six mixed medical/surgical) and ten hospitals (four academic, six community) in Canada and the United States. PATIENTS: Medical records of 2,731 adult patients with septic shock. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome measure was survival to hospital discharge. Among the 2,154 septic shock patients (78.9% total) who received effective antimicrobial therapy only after the onset of recurrent or persistent hypotension, a strong relationship between the delay in effective antimicrobial initiation and in-hospital mortality was noted (adjusted odds ratio 1.119 [per hour delay], 95% confidence interval 1.103-1.136, p<.0001). Administration of an antimicrobial effective for isolated or suspected pathogens within the first hour of documented hypotension was associated with a survival rate of 79.9%. Each hour of delay in antimicrobial administration over the ensuing 6 hrs was associated with an average decrease in survival of 7.6%. By the second hour after onset of persistent/recurrent hypotension, in-hospital mortality rate was significantly increased relative to receiving therapy within the first hour (odds ratio 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.48). In multivariate analysis (including Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and therapeutic variables), time to initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy was the single strongest predictor of outcome. Median time to effective antimicrobial therapy was 6 hrs (25-75th percentile, 2.0-15.0 hrs). CONCLUSIONS: Effective antimicrobial administration within the first hour of documented hypotension was associated with increased survival to hospital discharge in adult patients with septic shock. Despite a progressive increase in mortality rate with increasing delays, only 50% of septic shock patients received effective antimicrobial therapy within 6 hrs of documented hypotension.},

The American heart association (AHA) statement on evaluation of suspected Kawasaki disease (KD) would lead some SoJIA patients (particularly in the early stages of the disease) to be inaccurately classified as KD. In addition to the institution of inappropriate therapy with IVIG, misdiagnosis as KD can delay definitive treatment for these SoJIA patients who probably have a worse predicted outcome. We present a 6-year-old male patient with SoJIA who was initially classified as incomplete KD. The child developed life-threatening macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Family-centered rounds (FCR) are defined as interdisciplinary bedside teaching rounds with active family participation. The objective of this study was to examine the association of FCR with family experiences and health services use. METHODS: Prospective study comparing families with a child admitted to general pediatric inpatient services with and without FCR. The presence of FCR elements was assessed before study enrollment. Study data were obtained by an in-person interview, a follow-up phone interview <1 week after discharge, and medical record review. Family outcomes were informed by Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems measures. Health service use outcomes included hour of discharge, number of medications, and overall charges. Primary analyses included chi(2) and multivariate regression. Secondary analyses by using propensity score matching were performed to account for differences on observed variables. RESULTS: A total of 140 of 203 eligible families were enrolled; 97 completed follow-up surveys (49 on FCR team). Compared with non-FCR, FCR families were more likely to report consistent medical information (P < .001), the option of discussing care plan (P < .001), doctors listening carefully (P < .01), and doctors showing respect (P < .001). No differences were found in number of medications (mean 2.4 vs 2.9, P = .26) or discharge time (mean 3:06 pm versus 2:43 pm, P = .39). No difference was found for hospital charges after adjusting for length of stay outliers. CONCLUSIONS: FCR are associated with higher parent satisfaction, consistent medical information, and care plan discussion, with no additional burden to health service use. Additional studies should assess FCR under different settings of care.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: CT imaging of head-injured children has risks of radiation-induced malignancy. Our aim was to identify children at very low risk of clinically-important traumatic brain injuries (ciTBI) for whom CT might be unnecessary. METHODS: We enrolled patients younger than 18 years presenting within 24 h of head trauma with Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 14-15 in 25 North American emergency departments. We derived and validated age-specific prediction rules for ciTBI (death from traumatic brain injury, neurosurgery, intubation >24 h, or hospital admission >or=2 nights). FINDINGS: We enrolled and analysed 42 412 children (derivation and validation populations: 8502 and 2216 younger than 2 years, and 25 283 and 6411 aged 2 years and older). We obtained CT scans on 14 969 (35.3%); ciTBIs occurred in 376 (0.9%), and 60 (0.1%) underwent neurosurgery. In the validation population, the prediction rule for children younger than 2 years (normal mental status, no scalp haematoma except frontal, no loss of consciousness or loss of consciousness for less than 5 s, non-severe injury mechanism, no palpable skull fracture, and acting normally according to the parents) had a negative predictive value for ciTBI of 1176/1176 (100.0%, 95% CI 99.7-100 0) and sensitivity of 25/25 (100%, 86.3-100.0). 167 (24.1%) of 694 CT-imaged patients younger than 2 years were in this low-risk group. The prediction rule for children aged 2 years and older (normal mental status, no loss of consciousness, no vomiting, non-severe injury mechanism, no signs of basilar skull fracture, and no severe headache) had a negative predictive value of 3798/3800 (99.95%, 99.81-99.99) and sensitivity of 61/63 (96.8%, 89.0-99.6). 446 (20.1%) of 2223 CT-imaged patients aged 2 years and older were in this low-risk group. Neither rule missed neurosurgery in validation populations. INTERPRETATION: These validated prediction rules identified children at very low risk of ciTBIs for whom CT can routinely be obviated.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine a contemporary failed extubation rate, risk factors, and consequences of extubation failure in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Three hypotheses were investigated: a) Extubation failure is in part disease specific; b) preexisting respiratory conditions predispose to extubation failure; and c) admission acuity scoring does not affect extubation failure.
DESIGN: Twelve-month prospective, observational, clinical study.
SETTING: Sixteen diverse PICUs in the United States.
PATIENTS: Patients were 2,794 patients from the newborn period to 18 yrs of age experiencing a planned extubation trial.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A descriptive statistical analysis was performed, and outcome differences of the failed extubation population were determined. The extubation failure rate was 6.2% (174 of 2,794; 95% confidence interval, 5.3-7.1). Patient features associated with extubation failure (p <.05) included age < or =24 months; dysgenetic condition; syndromic condition; chronic respiratory disorder; chronic neurologic condition; medical or surgical airway condition; chronic noninvasive positive pressure ventilation; the need to replace the endotracheal tube on admission to the PICU; and the use of racemic epinephrine, steroids, helium-oxygen therapy (heliox), or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation within 24 hrs of extubation. Patients failing extubation had longer pre-extubation intubation time (failed, 148.7 hrs, SD +/- 207.8 vs. success, 107.9 hrs, SD +/- 171.3; p <.001), longer PICU length of stay (17.5 days, SD +/- 15.6 vs. 7.6 days, SD +/- 11.1; p <.001), and a higher mortality rate than patients not failing extubation (4.0% vs. 0.8%; p <.001). Failure was found to be in part disease specific, and preexisting respiratory conditions were found to predispose to failure whereas admission acuity did not.
CONCLUSION: A variety of patient features are associated with an increase in extubation failure rate, and serious outcome consequences characterize the extubation failure population in PICUs.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objectives of the present study were to estimate an annual number of patients with moyamoya disease in Japan and to describe the clinicoepidemiological features of the disease. METHODS: The study consisted of 2 questionnaire surveys, which were distributed to randomly selected departments of neurosurgery, internal medicine, neurology, cerebrovascular medicine, and pediatrics in hospitals throughout Japan. The first survey inquired about the number of the patients treated in 2003, and the second requested additional detailed clinicoepidemiological information about each patient identified in the first survey. RESULTS: In 2003, the total number of patients treated in Japan was estimated at 7700 (95% confidence interval, 6300 to 9300). Sex ratio (women to men) of the patients was 1.8. For men, the peak of moyamoya disease was observed in patients aged 10 to 14 years and for women aged 20 to 24 years. Annual rate of newly diagnosed cases in 2003 was 0.54 per 100,000 population. Family history of moyamoya disease was found in 12.1% of the patients. The majority (77.9%) were treated as outpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinicoepidemiological features of the patients in the present study were almost similar to those obtained in previous ones, the estimated prevalence of moyamoya disease in Japan has almost doubled during the recent decade (3900 in 1994 and 7700 in 2003). The increase could partly be explained by the increase in newly diagnosed cases (0.35 in 1994 and 0.54 in 2003 per 100,000 population).},

  Abstract                 = {Observational studies often provide the only available information about treatment effects. Control of confounding, however, remains challenging. The authors compared five methods for evaluating the effect of tissue plasminogen activator on death among 6,269 ischemic stroke patients registered in a German stroke registry: multivariable logistic regression, propensity score-matched analysis, regression adjustment with the propensity score, and two propensity score-based weighted methods-one estimating the treatment effect in the entire study population (inverse-probability-of-treatment weights), another in the treated population (standardized-mortality-ratio weights). Between 2000 and 2001, 212 patients received tissue plasminogen activator. The crude odds ratio between tissue plasminogen activator and death was 3.35 (95% confidence interval: 2.28, 4.91). The adjusted odds ratio depended strongly on the adjustment method, ranging from 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 0.67, 1.84) for the standardized-mortality-ratio weighted to 10.77 (95% confidence interval: 2.47, 47.04) for the inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted analysis. For treated patients with a low propensity score, risks of dying were high. Exclusion of patients with a propensity score of <5% yielded comparable odds ratios of approximately 1 for all methods. High levels of nonuniform treatment effect render summary estimates very sensitive to the weighting system explicit or implicit in an adjustment technique. Researchers need to be clear about the population for which an overall treatment estimate is most suitable.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The optimal hemoglobin threshold for erythrocyte transfusions in critically ill children is unknown. We hypothesized that a restrictive transfusion strategy of using packed red cells that were leukocyte-reduced before storage would be as safe as a liberal transfusion strategy, as judged by the outcome of multiple-organ dysfunction. METHODS: In this noninferiority trial, we enrolled 637 stable, critically ill children who had hemoglobin concentrations below 9.5 g per deciliter within 7 days after admission to an intensive care unit. We randomly assigned 320 patients to a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g per deciliter for red-cell transfusion (restrictive-strategy group) and 317 patients to a threshold of 9.5 g per deciliter (liberal-strategy group). RESULTS: Hemoglobin concentrations were maintained at a mean (+/-SD) level that was 2.1+/-0.2 g per deciliter lower in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group (lowest average levels, 8.7+/-0.4 and 10.8+/-0.5 g per deciliter, respectively; P<0.001). Patients in the restrictive-strategy group received 44% fewer transfusions; 174 patients (54%) in that group did not receive any transfusions, as compared with 7 patients (2%) in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). New or progressive multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome (the primary outcome) developed in 38 patients in the restrictive-strategy group, as compared with 39 in the liberal-strategy group (12% in both groups) (absolute risk reduction with the restrictive strategy, 0.4%; 95% confidence interval, -4.6 to 5.4). There were 14 deaths in each group within 28 days after randomization. No significant differences were found in other outcomes, including adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In stable, critically ill children a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g per deciliter for red-cell transfusion can decrease transfusion requirements without increasing adverse outcomes.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To determine whether insurance coverage and race are associated with long-term acute care hospital utilization in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Nonfederal Pennsylvania hospital discharges from 2004 to 2006. PATIENTS: Eligible patients were aged 18 yrs or older, of white or black race, and underwent mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit during their hospital stay. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We used multivariable logistic regression with hospital-level random effects to determine the independent association between discharge to long-term acute care hospital, insurance status, and race after appropriate controls, including a chart-based measure of severity of illness. The primary outcome measure was discharge to long-term acute care hospital. Of 66,233 eligible patients, 84.7% were white and 15.3% were black. More white patients than black patients had commercial insurance (23.4% vs. 14.9%) compared to Medicaid (10.6% vs. 29.7%) or no insurance (1.3% vs. 2.2%). Long-term acute care hospital transfer occurred in 5.0% of patients. On multivariable analysis in patients aged younger than 65 yrs, black patients were significantly less likely to undergo long-term acute care hospital transfer (odds ratio, 0.71; p = .003), as were patients with Medicaid vs. commercial insurance (odds ratio, 0.17; p < .001). Analyzing race and insurance together and accounting for hospital-level effects, patients with Medicaid were still less likely to undergo long-term acute care hospital transfer (odds ratio, 0.18; p < .001), but race effects were no longer present (odds ratio, 1.06; p = .615). No significant race effects were seen in the Medicare-eligible population aged 65 yrs or older (odds ratio for transfer to long-term acute care hospital, 0.93; p = .359). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in long-term acute care hospital utilization after critical illness appear driven by insurance status and hospital-level effects. Racial variation in long-term acute care hospital use is not seen after controlling for insurance status and is not seen in a group with uniform insurance coverage. Differential access to postacute care may be minimized by expanding commercial or Medicare insurance availability and standardizing long-term acute care admission criteria across hospitals.},

METHODS: Data on all air transports to or from the regional Neonatal Intensive Care (NICU) Unit within a 10-year period were collected. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-eight acute transports were conducted during the study period; 169 referrals to the NICU and 69 transfers to national surgical and cardiac centres. Only 13 very low birth weight infants were transported; the in utero transport rate was 95% for this patient population. The adjusted risk of death and/or intracranial haemorrhage for outborn very low birth weight infants was five-fold increased compared to those not transported postnatally. Babies with congenital heart disease comprised the one-fourth of all transports. The long-term mortality was 14% for the whole study population, and 29% for infants with congenital heart disease. Only seven deaths (3.2%) were defined as being transport-related; death during or within 24 h after transport. However, preventable complications like temperature instability, hypoglycaemia and hypo-/hypercapnia occurred in 10-20% of all transports. CONCLUSION: The transport related mortality was low in this study, however very low birth weight infants and infants with major congenital heart disease showed a relatively poor outcome.},

Two different approaches were used. The first, plotting the incidence of pneumonia versus the duration of ventilatory support, confirms previous data: the incidence rises from 5% in patients receiving one day of respiratory assistance to 68.8% in patients receiving more than 30 days. In the second approach, the same data were computed as an actuarial life table with the day of pneumonia onset as terminal event. This different approach, focusing on the onset of infection rather than on incidence, allows a new insight into the problem of nosocomial infection: pneumonia in patients with respiratory support is an early occurrence with a high and constant rate of acquisition and, therefore, a high risk of infection in the first eight to ten days. Later pneumonia acquisitions were rare, and the risk after ten days of ventilatory support is low.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: This report summarizes the epidemiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) deaths, hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits by race among children aged 0-14 years in the United States. Few other studies have reported the incidence of TBI in this population by race. METHODS: Data from 3 nationally representative sources maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics were used to report the annual numbers and rates of TBI-related deaths, hospitalizations, and ED visits during 1995-2001 by race, age, and external cause of injury. RESULTS: An estimated 475,000 TBIs occurred among children aged 0-14 each year. Rates were highest among children aged 0-4. For children aged 0-9 years, both death and hospitalization rates were significantly higher for blacks than whites for motor vehicle-traffic-related TBIs. CONCLUSION: With nearly half a million children affected each year, TBI is a serious public health problem. Variation in rates by race suggest the need to more closely examine the factors that contribute to these differences, such as the external causes of the injury and associated modifiable factors (e.g., the use of seatbelts and child safety seats).},

  Abstract                 = {The development of databases to track the outcomes of children with cardiovascular disease has been ongoing for much of the last two decades, paralleled by the rise of databases in the intensive care unit. While the breadth of data available in national, regional and local databases has grown exponentially, the ability to identify meaningful measurements of outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease is still in its early stages. In the United States of America, the Virtual Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Performance System (VPS) is a clinically based database system for the paediatric intensive care unit that provides standardized high quality, comparative data to its participants [https://portal.myvps.org/]. All participants collect information on multiple parameters: (1) patients and their stay in the hospital, (2) diagnoses, (3) interventions, (4) discharge, (5) various measures of outcome, (6) organ donation, and (7) paediatric severity of illness scores. Because of the standards of quality within the database, through customizable interfaces, the database can also be used for several applications: (1) administrative purposes, such as assessing the utilization of resources and strategic planning, (2) multi-institutional research studies, and (3) additional internal projects of quality improvement or research.In the United Kingdom, The Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network is a database established in 2002 to record details of the treatment of all critically ill children in paediatric intensive care units of the National Health Service in England, Wales and Scotland. The Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network was designed to develop and maintain a secure and confidential high quality clinical database of pediatric intensive care activity in order to meet the following objectives: (1) identify best clinical practice, (2) monitor supply and demand, (3) monitor and review outcomes of treatment episodes, (4) facilitate strategic healthcare planning, (5) quantify resource requirements, and (6) study the epidemiology of critical illness in children.Two distinct physiologic risk adjustment methodologies are the Pediatric Risk of Mortality Scoring System (PRISM), and the Paediatric Index of Mortality Scoring System 2 (PIM 2). Both Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM 2) and Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM 3) are comprised of clinical variables that include physiological and laboratory measurements that are weighted on a logistic scale. The raw Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) score provides quantitative measures of severity of illness. The Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) score when used in a logistic regression model provides a probability of the predicted risk of mortality. This predicted risk of mortality can then be used along with the rates of observed mortality to provide a quantitative measurement of the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR). Similar to the Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) scoring system, the Paediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) score is comprised of physiological and laboratory values and provides a quantitative measurement to estimate the probability of death using a logistic regression model.The primary use of national and international databases of patients with congenital cardiac disease should be to improve the quality of care for these patients. The utilization of common nomenclature and datasets by the various regional subspecialty databases will facilitate the eventual linking of these databases and the creation of a comprehensive database that spans conventional geographic and subspecialty boundaries.

  Abstract                 = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important worldwide cause of death and disability for children. The Approaches and Decisions for Acute Pediatric TBI (ADAPT) Trial is an observational, cohort study to compare the effectiveness of six aspects of TBI care. Understanding the differences between clinical sites-including their structure, clinical processes, and culture differences-will be necessary to assess differences in outcome from the study and can inform the overall community regarding differences across academic centers.We developed a survey and queried ADAPT site principal investigators with a focus on six domains: (i) hospital, (ii) pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), (iii) medical staff characteristics, (iv) quality of care, (v) medication safety, and (vi) safety culture. Summary statistics were used to describe differences between centers.ADAPT clinical sites that enrolled a subject within the first year (32 US-based, 11 international) were studied. A wide variation in site characteristics was observed in hospital and ICU characteristics, including an almost sevenfold range in ICU size (8-55 beds) and more than fivefold range of overall ICU admissions (537-2623). Nursing staffing (predominantly 1:1 or 1:2) and the presence of pharmacists within the ICU (79 \%) were less variable, and most sites "strongly agreed" or "agreed" that Neurosurgery and Critical Care teams worked well together (81.4 \%). However, a minority of sites (46 \%) used an explicit protocol for treatment of children with severe TBI care.We found a variety of inter-center structure, process, and culture differences. These intrinsic differences between sites may begin to explain why interventional studies have failed to prove efficacy of experimental therapies.

  Abstract                 = {Rare cases of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) occurring during the acute phase of Kawasaki disease (KD) have been reported. We sought to characterize, review treatment, and outcomes of KD patients with clinical features of MAS. Medical histories of patients treated for KD and MAS between January 2001 and March 2008 were reviewed. Of 638 KD patients seen, 12 (1.9%) had additional clinical findings usually associated with MAS; 7 of them were males older than 5 years (6.1%; odds ratio: 6.8, P=0.002). Clinically, 9 patients had at least 4 of 5 KD clinical signs, and all patients had prolonged fever beyond initial intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. Hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia in two or more cell lines, hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, and increased D-dimers were seen in 11 patients. Hyperferritinemia and elevated hepatic enzymes were seen in all patients. Four patients had biopsy-proven evidence of hemophagocytosis. All but 2 patients met at least 5 of 8 criteria necessary for MAS diagnosis. Treatment beyond the standard KD protocol (aspirin + intravenous immunoglobulin) was necessary in all but 1 patient. All patients eventually recovered with no long-term sequelae. A high index of suspicion for clinical features associated with MAS is warranted for KD patients to provide appropriate and timely treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as a promising pulmonary vasodilator to treat pulmonary hypertension associated with heart disease and ventilation/perfusion mismatching. However, the pharmacokinetics of inhaled NO still remains obscure and its cardiopulmonary selectivity appears to be increasingly under debate. In the present study measured NO content and levels of cyclic guanosine 3',5'monophosphate (cGMP), a mediator of NO-induced vasodilation, in a variety of organs from rats subjected to NO inhalation. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy associated to a spin trapping technique using N-methyl D-glucamine dithiocarbamate (FeMGD) was used to directly quantify NO levels in the lung, kidney, liver, aorta, and heart from anesthetized Wistar rats subjected to various doses (0, 20, 50, 100, or 200 ppm) and various times (0, 30, 45, or 75 minutes) of inhaled NO. Inhaled NO at a dose of 100 and 200 ppm significantly increased the NO-FeMGD complex in all organs studied. An increase of cGMP was detected in the lung and the aorta after inhaled NO for 45 minutes at the dose of 50 ppm. No changes in NO levels and its metabolites were shown between 30 and 75 minutes of inhaled NO. The results show that inhaled NO at a dose of 100 ppm or more increases NO levels in other organs beside the lung, strongly suggesting that inhaled NO would be more than a pulmonary vasodilator and its selectivity remains to be reconsidered when used for therapeutic purposes.},

Here, we present the case of a male adolescent (age 16 years and 3 months) who suffered from spiking fever for more than 1 week, and multiple nodules over the neck and bilateral axilla for 2 months. A skin rash also developed over all four limbs, abdomen and face. Laboratory data and skin biopsy gave results compatible with a diagnosis of Kikuchi's disease. Hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow, hyper-triglyceridemia, elevated ferritin, and splenomegaly were also found, fulfilling the criteria for HLH. A recent primary Epstein-Barr virus infection was also diagnosed by serology. The patient ran a relatively benign course. Intravenous immunoglobulins, steroids or etoposide-containing regimens were not used, and his recovery was uneventful. A review of the literature showed that up to February 2009, 11 additional cases of Kikuchi's disease presenting simultaneously with, or mimicking, HLH had been reported. Complete resolution within several weeks, with no recurrence, was seen in all but one patient (a pregnant woman).},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: We examined a trend in infant mortality caused by congenital malformations in the United States, particularly for the racial disparity between whites and nonwhites. METHODS: We used US annual summary data on cause-specific infant mortality for 1970-97 and detailed birth and infant death linked data for 1985-87, 1989-91, and 1995-97. RESULTS: Congenital malformations became a more prominent cause of infant mortality in 1997 and accounted for 22.1% of all infant deaths compared with 15.1% in 1970. Congenital malformations of nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems accounted for more than 60% of all malformation deaths. Malformations incompatible with life (anencephaly, encephalocele, hypoplastic lungs, renal agenesis, and trisomies 13 and 18) were the cause of one-third of all malformation deaths. In 1970-71, infant mortality caused by congenital malformations in nonwhites was lower, 2.6 (confidence interval [CI] 2.5, 2.7) per 1000, compared with whites, 3.1 (CI 3.0, 3.1) per 1000. However, in 1996-97, the rate of congenital malformation-specific infant mortality was higher in nonwhites, 1.7 (CI 1.7, 1.8) per 1000, compared with whites, 1.6 (CI 1.5, 1.6) per 1000. This trend was most pronounced with central nervous system malformations. Although whites had an almost two-fold higher infant mortality rate from central nervous system malformations compared with nonwhites in 1970-71, this disparity was no longer present by 1996-97. CONCLUSION: Congenital malformations have become a leading cause of infant mortality in the 1990s. Over the last several decades, this mortality declined more slowly in nonwhites than in whites.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to examine alterations in end-of-life support in a multiinstitutional sample of PICUs.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, descriptive study. Variables collected included end-of-life support category, race, length of stay, operative status, reason for admission, and Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 score, as well as the number of ICU beds and the presence of trainees.
RESULTS: There were 1745 deaths at 35 institutions between January 1, 2004, and September 30, 2005. Of those, 1263 had complete data and were analyzed. The end-of-life support category distribution was as follows: brain death, 296 (23%); do not resuscitate, 205 (16%); limitation of support, 36 (3%); withdrawal of support, 579 (46%); no limitation, 124 (10%); no advance directives, 23 (2%). For further analyses, end-of-life support categories were grouped as limitation (ie, do not resuscitate, limitation of support, or withdrawal of support) versus no limitation (ie, no limitation or no advance directive). Brain death was not included in further analyses. The majority of deaths were in the limitation group (n=820 [85%]), and 12 (40%) of 30 institutions had 100% of deaths in this group. There were significant differences between institutions (P<.001). Decisions for limitation were seen less frequently in the black race (112 [76%] of 147 deaths; P=.037) and in institutions with no trainees (56 [69%] of 81 deaths; P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Decisions to limit support are common. Black race and an absence of trainees are associated with decreased frequency of limitation decisions.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:: Major extracranial injury (MEI) is common in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients, but the effect on outcome is controversial. OBJECTIVE:: To assess the prognostic value of MEI on mortality after TBI in an individual patient data meta-analysis of three observational TBI studies (IMPACT), a randomized controlled trial (CRASH), and a trauma registry (TARN). METHODS:: MEI (extracranial injury with an AIS >/= 3 or "requiring hospital admission") was related to mortality with logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, GCS motor score and pupil reactivity, stratified by TBI severity. We pooled odds ratios (ORs) with random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS:: We included 39,274 patients. Mortality was 25% and 32% had MEI. MEI was a strong predictor for mortality in TARN, with adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of 2.81 (2.44-3.23) in mild, 2.18 (1.80-2.65) in moderate and 2.14 (1.95-2.35) in severe TBI patients. The prognostic effect was smaller in IMPACT and CRASH with pooled adjusted ORs and 95%CIs of 2.14 (0.93-4.91) in mild, 1.46 (1.14-1.85) in moderate and 1.18 (1.03-1.55) in severe TBI. When patients who died within 6 hours after injury were excluded from TARN, the effect of MEI was comparable with IMPACT and CRASH. CONCLUSION:: MEI is an important prognostic factor for mortality in TBI patients. However, the effect varies by population, which explains the controversy in the literature. The strength of the effect is smaller in patients with more severe brain injury, and depends on time of inclusion in a study.},

DESIGN: Single-institution retrospective cohort study identified children with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 from January 1, 2002 to May 1, 2009 who were followed for 2.3 mean yrs. SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital and outpatient clinics in a vertically integrated healthcare system. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine children with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 were grouped according to the level of respiratory support their caregivers chose within the first 3 months after diagnosis: proactive respiratory care (n = 26) and supportive care (n = 23). INTERVENTIONS: Proactive respiratory care included bilevel noninvasive ventilation during sleep and twice a day cough assist while supportive respiratory care included suctioning, with or without supplemental oxygen. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival curves were assessed based on intention to treat. Children treated with early proactive respiratory support had statistically longer survival compared to supportive care (log rank 0.047); however, the adjusted hazard ratio for survival was not statistically different (2.44 [95% confidence interval 0.84-7.1]). Children in the proactive group were more likely to be hospitalized for respiratory insufficiency (83% vs. 46%) and had shortened time after diagnosis until first hospital admission for respiratory insufficiency (median 118 vs. 979 days). CONCLUSION: Longer survival time with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 is associated with early, noninvasive respiratory care interventions after diagnosis.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of intravascular devices in the usual and daily clinical practice, used as diagnostic or as therapeutic means, is a reality nowadays, present in all hospitals of our medium, and it is increasing. In the area of intensive care, it constitutes a routine and prolonged procedure, and its contribution within the hospitality area, in the context of complications derived from its use, is important. The most frequent complication derived from the use of intravascular catheters or devices, is infection, which manifests itself either locally or systemically. At present it is considered that the bacteremia associated with a catheter, is by far the most common nosocomial cause of bacteremia in our environment, along with the associated morbido-mortality which this implies, the prolonged hospitalization, and the increased cost of health care. The connection of these catheters is an entry site which should be considered, and it is taking on greater significance in these past years. As always, the prophylaxis measures which are applied rigorously and on a daily manner, are the corner stone on which the possibility of minimizing these complications rests.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Cervical spine injuries in children are rare. However, immobilization and imaging for potential cervical spine injury after trauma are common and are associated with adverse effects. Risk factors for cervical spine injury have been developed to safely limit immobilization and radiography in adults, but not in children. The purpose of our study is to identify risk factors associated with cervical spine injury in children after blunt trauma. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of children younger than 16 years, presenting after blunt trauma, and who received cervical spine radiographs at 17 hospitals in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) between January 2000 and December 2004. Cases were children with cervical spine injury. We created 3 control groups of children free of cervical spine injury: (1) random controls, (2) age and mechanism of injury-matched controls, and (3) for cases receiving out-of-hospital emergency medical services (EMS), age-matched controls who also received EMS care. We abstracted data from 3 sources: PECARN hospital, referring hospital, and out-of-hospital patient records. We performed multiple logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of cervical spine injury and calculated the model's sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: We reviewed 540 records of children with cervical spine injury and 1,060, 1,012, and 702 random, mechanism of injury, and EMS controls, respectively. In the analysis using random controls, we identified 8 factors associated with cervical spine injury: altered mental status, focal neurologic findings, neck pain, torticollis, substantial torso injury, conditions predisposing to cervical spine injury, diving, and high-risk motor vehicle crash. Having 1 or more factors was 98% (95% confidence interval 96% to 99%) sensitive and 26% (95% confidence interval 23% to 29%) specific for cervical spine injury. We identified similar risk factors in the other analyses. CONCLUSION: We identified an 8-variable model for cervical spine injury in children after blunt trauma that warrants prospective refinement and validation.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: During the past 50 years, changes in the epidemiology of infectious diseases and the capabilities of medical technology have altered the indications for, and implications of, tracheotomy in children. Given the complexity of health care that these patients subsequently require, monitoring the performance of this procedure and patient outcomes across the diverse US health care system is warranted. OBJECTIVES: To characterize children who received tracheotomies in 1997 and to determine whether disposition and mortality vary by region or health care system attributes. DESIGN: A nationally representative retrospective cohort drawn from an 80% sample of administrative hospital discharge records from all pediatric admissions in 22 states during 1997. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 0 to 18 years who underwent tracheotomy. METHODS: The sampling scheme of the discharge records enabled the calculation of regional and national estimates and of age-stratified population-based rates of tracheotomies. Weighted descriptive statistical and Poisson analyses were performed. RESULTS: The 2065 tracheotomy procedures recorded in the Kids' Inpatient Database yielded a national estimate of 4861 tracheotomies performed in 1997. The mean length of hospital stay was 50 days, with a mean total facilities charge exceeding $200,000. The rate of tracheotomy was highest among infants and varied significantly across regions of the United States. Adjusting for other patient and health care system attributes, patients who received their tracheotomy in a children's hospital had half the risk of dying during the admission compared with patients who were cared for in a non-children's hospital. Hospitals that performed more pediatric tracheotomies had significantly lower mortality rates than hospitals with lesser case volume. Among patients who survived to discharge, those cared for in the Northeast were discharged to long-term care facilities at twice the rate of patients in the West. Children cared for in children's hospitals or in teaching hospitals were significantly less likely to be discharged to a long-term care facility. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric tracheotomy is associated with significant variation in rates and outcomes across the United States and across different hospital types. Further research to clarify the reasons for these associations is warranted.},

  Abstract                 = {In addition to its well described function as an enzymatic inhibitor of specific caspases, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (X-linked IAP or XIAP) can function as a cofactor in Smad, NF-kappaB, and JNK signaling pathways. However, caspases themselves have been shown to regulate the activity of a number of signaling cascades, raising the possibility that the effect of XIAP in these pathways is indirect. Here we examine this question by introducing point mutations in XIAP predicted to disrupt the ability of the molecule to bind to and inhibit caspases. We show that whereas these mutant variants of XIAP lost caspase-inhibitory activity, they maintained their ability to activate Smad, NF-kappaB, and JNK signaling pathways. Indeed, the signaling properties of the molecule were mapped to domains not directly involved in caspase binding and inhibition. The activation of NF-kappaB by XIAP was dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the RING domain. On the other hand, the ability of XIAP to activate Smad-dependent signaling was mapped to the third baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) and loop regions of the molecule. Thus, the anti-apoptotic and signaling properties of XIAP can be uncoupled.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective chart review; urban trauma center/pediatric emergency department. Trauma patients aged 3 months to 15 years given discharge diagnosis ICD-9-CM codes indicating head trauma and seen from 1988 to 1990 were eligible for the study.None.Of 194 patients, 96\% suffered blunt trauma and 53\% had a loss of consciousness. Fifty-one percent of 141 computed tomography (CT) scans of the head were abnormal, most frequently demonstrating skull fractures (34\%), subdural hematomas (15\%), and cerebral contusions (14\%). Eighteen patients (9.3\%) suffered post-traumatic seizures. A loss of consciousness, a low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (3 to 8), and an abnormal CT scan were associated with post-traumatic seizures (P < .02, .001, and .02, respectively). However, only a low GCS score was predictive of post-traumatic seizures when these factors were considered simultaneously (P < .001), with 38.7\% of patients with low GCS scores suffering post-traumatic seizures and 3.8\% of patients with high GCS scores suffering post-traumatic seizures. In children with low GCS scores, treatment with phenytoin was associated with a decrease in post-traumatic seizures.In the pediatric head trauma patient, a GCS score of 3 to 8 appears to be predictive of post-traumatic seizures. The data from this retrospective study are consistent with the hypothesis that prophylactic phenytoin reduces post-traumatic seizures in the pediatric head trauma patient with a low GCS score.},

We identified 872 autopsied SIDS cases and 3,704 controls matched to cases on year of birth. To reduce the confounding from unmeasured socioeconomic and behavioral factors, we analyzed the data separately for infants with and without father's race provided on the birth certificate. Among infants whose father's race was known, those of multiparous women with a prior spontaneous pregnancy loss before 20 weeks gestational age were at reduced risk of SIDS, after adjustment for maternal age, prenatal smoking,a nd gravidity. An increased number of prior pregnancy losses was associated with a further reduction in the risk of SIDS: one prior pregnancy loss was associated with a 25% decrease [odds ratio (OR) = 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.52-1.08], and two or more prior pregnancy losses was associated with a 47% decrease (OR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.30-0.94). There was no such association, however, among infants of women with no prior livebirth. Similar associations were observed between prior spontaneous pregnancy loss during the entire gestational period and the risk of SIDS in offspring. To explain the different associations between maternal prior pregnancy loss and the risk of SIDS observed among infants of women with and without a prior livebirth, we hypothesize an upward bias resulting from the presence of a larger proportion of infants of human leukocyte antigen-compatible couples among first liveborn infants.},

  Abstract                 = {It is widely believed that the UGT1A isoforms, UGT1A8 and -1A10, are expressed exclusively in extrahepatic tissues. In this work, human primary hepatocytes from six donors were analyzed for UGT1A8 and -1A10 mRNA expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. New primers to amplify UGT1A8 mRNA were designed and found to differ from those previously published. We demonstrated that UGT1A8 and -1A10 mRNA are expressed in hepatocytes. Although basal UGT mRNA levels were detected in untreated hepatocytes, significant up-regulation of the levels of mRNA for these isoforms were seen after treatment with 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) and rifampicin (Rif). RT-PCR products for all UGTs were sequenced and unambiguously identified as matching the corresponding cDNA. The discovery of these isoforms in hepatocytes is a novel discovery and will stimulate studies on the potential role for these isoforms in hepatic detoxification.},

  Abstract                 = {We performed a retrospective, observational study at a level I pediatric trauma center of children with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) from January 2002 to September 2006 to identify clinical and radiographic risk factors for early post-traumatic seizures (EPTS). Two hundred and ninety-nine children ages 0-15 years were evaluated, with 24 excluded because they died before the initial head computed tomography (CT) was obtained (n=20), or because their medical records were missing (n=4). Records were reviewed for accident characteristics, pre-hospital hypoxia or hypotension, initial non-contrast head CT characteristics, seizure occurrence, antiepileptic drug (AED) administration, and outcome. All care was at the discretion of the treating physicians, including the use of AEDs and continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring in patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents. The primary outcome was seizure activity during the first 7 days as determined by clinician observation or EEG analysis. Of the 275 patients included in the study, 34 had identified EPTS (12%). Risk factors identified on bivariable analysis included pre-hospital hypoxia, young age, non-accidental trauma (NAT), severe TBI, impact seizure, and subdural hemorrhage, while receiving an AED was protective. Independent risk factors identified by multivariable analysis were age <2 years (OR 3.0 [95% CI 1.0,8.6]), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score </=8 (OR 8.7 [95% CI 1.1,67.6]), and NAT as a mechanism of injury (OR 3.4 [95% CI 1.0,11.3]). AED treatment was protective against EPTS (OR 0.2 [95% CI 0.07,0.5]). Twenty-three (68%) patients developed EPTS within the first 12 h post-injury. This early peak in EPTS activity and demonstrated protective effect of AED administration in this cohort suggests that to evaluate the maximal potential benefit among patients at increased risk for EPTS, future research should be randomized and prospective, and should intervene during pre-trauma center care with initiation of continuous EEG monitoring as soon as possible.},

  Abstract                 = {The majority of sudden, nontraumatic deaths in young, otherwise healthy individuals result from an unknown underlying cardiac abnormality. The low sensitivity of the traditional history and physical exam in detecting these anomalies has led to a debate regarding the use of routine screening electrocardiograms (ECGs) in young adults. The present study screened 1,099 ROTC cadets applying for aviator status during the summers of 2005 and 2006. Seven candidates (0.6%) were disqualified because of ECG abnormalities, including two with Wolf Parkinson White syndrome. None of the individuals were identified by history and physical exam. ECG was an effective screening tool for detecting silent abnormalities with potential for arrhythmia in our population of healthy young adults. Other ECG findings indicative of anatomic abnormalities were not found. ECG screening can be a valuable tool and should be used in evaluating certain subsets of the population.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been estimated that up to 27% of all medical emergencies presenting to emergency departments are due to hypertension, predominantly in the adult population. Although this often is an insidious process, acutely, a hypertensive emergency occurs when a patient presents with severe hypertension and evidence of end organ damage. We discuss the case of a 12-year-old female with spastic cerebral palsy and global developmental delay secondary to neonatal asphyxia who presented to the emergency department after having a seizure at home. On arrival to the emergency department, she was found to have a heart rate (HR) of 170 and a left upper extremity blood pressure of 174/112. Initial electrocardiogram revealed a HR of 163, with significant ST segment elevations in leads I, II, and minimal elevations in V4, 5, and 6. Intravenous Metoprolol 2.5 mg was administered 3 times with 5 minutes interval between doses, which resulted in a decline in HR (106) and blood pressure (128/86), and subsequent resolution of the electrocardiogram changes. An extensive workup revealed the patient had gallstones, however, her hypertension did not resolve with pain control and, ultimately, cholecystectomy. The remainder of her evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and her blood pressure was, eventually, controlled with 3 medications: clonidine, isradipine, and amlodipine. Over the ensuing 2 years, these were weaned with no recurrent hypertensive episodes. Although studies have shown extended release Metoprolol to be a safe and effective treatment in children with established hypertension, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been studied in a pediatric emergency setting.},

Development and validation of a new pediatric mortality model using randomly selected prediction and validation samples from our cohort.A single level 1 pediatric trauma center.Six hundred thirty-two children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury.None.Sixteen percent of the patients (101 of 632) died prior to hospital discharge. The predicted mortality based on Rotterdam score for adults with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury discriminated pediatric observed mortality well (area under the curve = 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.89) but had poor calibration, overestimating or underestimating mortality for children in several Rotterdam categories. A predictive model based on children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury from the single center discriminated mortality well (area under the curve, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.68-0.91) and showed good calibration and overall fit.Children with traumatic brain injury have better survival than adults in Rotterdam CT score categories representing less severe injuries but worse survival than adults in higher score categories. A novel, validated pediatric mortality model based on the Rotterdam score is accurate in children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury and can be used for risk stratification.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Differences between centers in patient outcome after traumatic brain injury are of importance for multicenter studies and have seldom been studied. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the differences in centers enrolling patients in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and surveys. METHODS: We analyzed individual patient data from 9578 patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury enrolled in 10 RCTs and 3 observational studies. We used random-effects logistic regression models to estimate the between-center differences in unfavorable outcome (dead, vegetative state, or severe disability measured with the Glasgow Outcome Scale) at 6 months adjusted for differences in patient characteristics. We calculated the difference in odds of unfavorable outcome between the centers at the higher end vs those at the lower end of the outcome distribution. We analyzed the total database, Europe and the United States separately, and 4 larger RCTs. RESULTS: The 9578 patients were enrolled at 265 centers, and 4629 (48%) had an unfavorable outcome. After adjustment for patient characteristics, there was a 3.3-fold difference in the odds of unfavorable outcome between the centers at the lower end of the outcome distribution (2.5th percentile) vs those at the higher end of the outcome distribution (97.5th percentile; P<.001). In the 4 larger RCTs, the differences between centers were similar. However, differences were smaller between centers in the United States (2.4-fold) than between centers in Europe (3.8-fold). CONCLUSION: Outcome after traumatic brain injury differs substantially between centers, particularly in Europe. Further research is needed to study explanations for these differences to suggest where quality of care might be improved.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: In Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), large between-centre differences in outcome exist and many clinicians believe that such differences influence estimation of the treatment effect in randomized controlled trial (RCTs). The aim of this study was to assess the influence of between-centre differences in outcome on the estimated treatment effect in a large RCT in TBI. METHODS: We used data from the MRC CRASH trial on the efficacy of corticosteroid infusion in patients with TBI. We analyzed the effect of the treatment on 14 day mortality with fixed effect logistic regression. Next we used random effects logistic regression with a random intercept to estimate the treatment effect taking into account between-centre differences in outcome. Between-centre differences in outcome were expressed with a 95% range of odds ratios (OR) for centres compared to the average, based on the variance of the random effects (tau2). A random effects logistic regression model with random slopes was used to allow the treatment effect to vary by centre. The variation in treatment effect between the centres was expressed in a 95% range of the estimated treatment ORs. RESULTS: In 9978 patients from 237 centres, 14-day mortality was 19.5%. Mortality was higher in the treatment group (OR = 1.22, p = 0.00010). Using a random effects model showed large between-centre differences in outcome (95% range of centre effects: 0.27- 3.71), but did not substantially change the estimated treatment effect (OR = 1.24, p = 0.00003). There was limited, although statistically significant, between-centre variation in the treatment effect (OR = 1.22, 95% treatment OR range: 1.17-1.26). CONCLUSION: Large between-centre differences in outcome do not necessarily affect the estimated treatment effect in RCTs, in contrast to current beliefs in the clinical area of TBI.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patient's demographics or severity of illness predict hospital readmission within 30 days following spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, to identify readmission associations that may be modifiable at the single-center level, and to determine the impact of readmission on outcomes. DESIGN: We collected demographic, clinical, and hospital course data for consecutive patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage enrolled in an observational study. Readmission within 30 days was determined retrospectively by an automated query with manual confirmation. We identified the reason for readmission and tested for associations between readmission and functional outcomes using modified Rankin Scale (a validated functional outcome measure from 0, no symptoms, to 6, death) scores before intracerebral hemorrhage and at 14 days, 28 days, and 3 months after intracerebral hemorrhage. SETTING: Neurologic ICU of a tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received standard critical care management for intracerebral hemorrhage. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 246 patients (mean age, 65 yr; 51% female), 193 patients (78%) survived to discharge. Of these, 22 patients (11%) were readmitted at a median of 9 days (interquartile range, 4-15 d). The most common readmission diagnoses were infections after discharge (n = 10) and vascular events (n = 6). Age, history of stroke and hypertension, severity of neurologic deficit at admission, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score, ICU and hospital length of stay, ventilator-free days, days febrile, and surgical procedures were not predictors of readmission. History of coronary artery disease was associated with readmission (p = 0.03). Readmitted patients had similar modified Rankin Scale and severity of neurologic deficit at 14 days but higher (worse) modified Rankin Scale scores at 3 months (median [interquartile range], 5 [3-6] vs 3 [1-4]; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Severity of illness and hospital complications were not associated with 30-day readmission. The most common indication for readmission was infection after discharge, and readmission was associated with worse functional outcomes at 3 months. Preventing readmission after intracerebral hemorrhage may depend primarily on optimizing care after discharge and may improve functional outcomes at 3 months.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: While early discharge of newborns following routine vaginal delivery has become common practice, its safety has not been firmly established. OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk for rehospitalization following newborn early discharge. DESIGN: Population-based, case-control study. SETTING: Washington State linked birth certificate and hospital discharge abstracts covering 310578 live births from 1991 through 1994. PATIENTS: Case patients were 2029 newborns rehospitalized in the first month of life. Control subjects were 8657 randomly selected newborns not rehospitalized and frequency matched to case patients on year of birth. Cesarean deliveries, multiple births, and births at less than 36 weeks' gestation were not included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Stratified analyses and logistic regression were performed to assess the risk for rehospitalization within a month of birth after early discharge (<30 hours after birth) compared with later discharge (30-78 hours after birth). RESULTS: Seventeen percent of newborns were discharged early. Newborns discharged early were more likely to be rehospitalized within 7 days (odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.47), 14 days (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03-1.32), and 28 days (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00-1.25) of discharge than newborns sent home later. Subgroups at increased risk for rehospitalization following early discharge included newborns born to primigravidas (OR,1.25; 95% CI, 1.07-1.45), mothers younger than 18 years (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.79-1.91), and mothers with premature rupture of membranes (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.85-2.36). Early discharge was also associated with an increased risk of readmission for jaundice, dehydration, and sepsis. CONCLUSION: Newborns discharged home early (<30 hours after birth) are at increased risk for rehospitalization during the first month of life.},

  Abstract                 = {Optimal stimulation and prevention of anergy in T cells requires signaling through the CD28 molecule. During HIV disease progression, CD28 expression is lost, particularly on CD8+ T cells. Because alterations in cytokine production patterns occur during HIV infection, we determined whether CD8+ T cell phenotype or function was affected by cytokine environment. Treatment of CD8+ T cells with IL-4 decreased levels of both CD28 surface expression and message and increased CD8 expression. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells that had down-regulated CD28 had reduced proliferative capacity. The inhibitory effects of CD28 reduction could be compensated either by increased anti-CD3 or by exogenous IL-2, suggesting that the strength of T cell signaling necessary for the production of IL-2 and subsequent proliferation is negatively regulated by IL-4. CD8+ subpopulations with differential CD28 expression produced different patterns of cytokines, particularly IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells that had reduced CD28 levels but made their own IL-2 were able to proliferate in response to TCR stimulation. These results suggest that loss of CD28 expression and CD8 T cell function can be regulated by the cytokine environment, which may be altered during HIV disease progression. Whether the dysfunction of CD8+ T cells in HIV infection occurs by such a mechanism is the subject of future investigation.},

Pathogens most commonly involved with these pneumonias are Enterobacteriaceae, Ps. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Several prevention measures for nosocomial pneumonia are possible such as parenteral and topical antibiotics--a very controversial issue. Several studies with parenteral antibiotics, starting as early as 1954, could not prove any benefit of parenteral antibiotics in pneumonia prevention. Topical antibiotics, starting with polymyxin or gentamicin via the endotracheal tube in the 70s, gave controversial results. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study with gentamicin via the endotracheal tube in ventilated ICU patients we found no significant reduction of pneumonia rate and mortality. However, the combined approach (SDD) of oropharyngeal, gastrointestinal and parenteral use of certain antibiotics appears to give promising results in specific patient subgroups such as ventilated polytrauma patients in ICU.},

METHODS: Review of salient literature, clinical and personal experiences, conference presentations and discussions, and post-conference comments from outside experts. RESULTS: PROs (information from patients about a health condition and its management) have been assessed through self-reports for at least four decades. Traditional applications are in clinical and health services research. Uses in clinical practice, although increasing, are less common and more challenging. PROs can enhance the understanding of patients' experiences and responses to therapy and inform clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: We pose and discuss four main questions: (1) Will clinicians accept PRO measures? (2) Will clinicians use PRO measures? (3) Will measuring PROs actually improve those outcomes? (4) Will PROs be perceived as having other, less salutary purposes? A patient-centered perspective on PRO measurement presents issues about the extent to which PROs can accurately capture patient experiences and assess psychosocial and environmental factors that influence communication with clinicians and eventual outcomes. We end with comments about the intersection of PROs and bioethics, noting contributions that PROs may make to beneficence, patient autonomy, and distributive justice.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To identify the clinical characteristics of and to explore the prognostic factors influencing mortality in children with Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH). METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted on 62 pediatric patients with EBV-HLH who were admitted to our hospital between 2003 and 2008. All their medical records were reviewed and analyzed. For each patient, demographic, clinical and laboratory data, genetic findings and outcome information were collected. The patients were divided into two groups: deceased or survived based on the follow-up results. Comparative analysis of the data was done by using independent-samples t test and Logistic multiple and univariate regression. RESULT: (1) Among the 62 EBV-HLH patients, 36 were male and 26 were female. The age of onset ranged from 2 months to 14 years and most of the patients were between 1 and 3 years of age. EBV-HLH occurred mainly in the setting of reactivation (61.3%). (2) All patients exhibited persistent or intermittent fever and cytopenia >/= 2 cell lines. Most of the patients presented with hepatomegaly (83.9%), splenomegaly (72.6%) and lymphadenopathy (69.4%). The main laboratory features showed an elevation of serum ferritin and aminotransferase levels. A reduction in serum albumin was observed and exhibited coagulopathy with hypofibrinogenemia and hypertriglyceridemia in most of the patients. Forty-eight of patients had hemophagocytosis in bone marrow at diagnosis of EBV-HLH. The serum EBV DNA level in 14 of 31 patients with EBV-HLH was in the range of 5.12 x 10(2) - 7.69 x 10(7) copies/ml with a mean value of 10(3.9) copies/ml. (3) Three heterozygous mutations in coding region were found, which resulted in amino acid change (C102F, S108N and T450M) in 3 patients. One patient had compound heterozygous mutations (S108N and T450M) in the PRF1 gene as the background defect and documented familial HLH type 2 (FHL2). (4) During the observational period, 35 of 57 patients (61.4%) died 3 months to 3 years after the onset, while 21 of whom died despite aggressive polychemotherapy, 15 of whom died within 2 months after hospitalization. The deceased patients were more likely to have lower albumin level and more prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time than the survived patients (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis revealed that duration of illness >/= 1 month, non-chemotherapy, albumin level < / = 25 microg/L and internal organs hemorrhage were related with the prognosis significantly (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that EBV-HLH infection in pediatric patients had severe clinical courses and prognosis was poor and the majority of cases underwent EBV reactivation. The early diagnosis, prompt and proper chemotherapy can improve the survival rate. The duration of illness >/= 1 month, non-chemotherapy, decreases in albumin and internal organs hemorrhage were the risk factors related to mortality in children with EBV-HLH.},

  Abstract                 = {The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) is the primary endpoint for efficacy analysis of clinical trials in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Accurate and consistent assessment of outcome after TBI is essential to the evaluation of treatment results, particularly in the context of multicenter studies and trials. The inconsistent measurement or interobserver variation on GOS outcome, or for that matter, on any outcome scales, may adversely affect the sensitivity to detect treatment effects in clinical trial. The objective of this study is to examine effects of nondifferential misclassification of the widely used five-category GOS outcome scale and in particular to assess the impact of this misclassification on detecting a treatment effect and statistical power. We followed two approaches. First, outcome differences were analyzed before and after correction for misclassification using a dataset of 860 patients with severe brain injury randomly sampled from two TBI trials with known differences in outcome. Second, the effects of misclassification on outcome distribution and statistical power were analyzed in simulation studies on a hypothetical 800-patient dataset. Three potential patterns of nondifferential misclassification (random, upward and downward) on the dichotomous GOS outcome were analyzed, and the power of finding treatments differences was investigated in detail. All three patterns of misclassification reduce the power of detecting the true treatment effect and therefore lead to a reduced estimation of the true efficacy. The magnitude of such influence not only depends on the size of the misclassification, but also on the magnitude of the treatment effect. In conclusion, nondifferential misclassification directly reduces the power of finding the true treatment effect. An awareness of this procedural error and methods to reduce misclassification should be incorporated in TBI clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, a normal mode analysis, named phase integrated method (PIM), is developed for computing modes of biomolecules in a crystalline environment. PIM can calculate low-frequency modes on one or a few asymmetric units (AUs) and generate exact modes of a whole unit cell according to space group symmetry, while the translational symmetry between unit cells is maintained via the periodic boundary condition. Therefore, the method can dramatically reduce computational cost in mode calculation in the presence of crystal symmetry. PIM also has an option to map modes onto a single AU to form an orthonormalized mode set, which can be directly applied to normal-mode-based thermal parameter refinement in X-ray crystallography. The performance of PIM was tested on all 65 space groups available in protein crystals (one protein for each space group) and on another set of 83 ultra-high-resolution X-ray structures. The results showed that considering space group symmetry in mode calculation is crucial for accurately describing vibrational motion in a crystalline environment. Moreover, the optimal inter-AU packing stiffness was found to be about 60% of that of intra-AU interactions (non-bonded interaction only).},

  Abstract                 = {To evaluate the effect of aggressive intrapartum and early neonatal resuscitation on perinatal mortality, neonatal morbidity, and long-term outcome, we evaluated two groups of low-birth-weight infants who received different intrapartum and early neonatal care. One group of infants was delivered at a university-based regional perinatal center offering both high-risk obstetric and tertiary neonatal care. The second population consisted of infants from five community hospitals with level I nurseries. These two groups were selected because they differed in the ability to provide intrapartum and early neonatal care and because a total base population could be evaluated. During the 4-year study period, 174 infants with birth weights of 500 to 1499 gm were delivered at the university center and 297 infants were delivered at the community hospitals. At the university center, there was a significant reduction in fetal deaths, a delay in the time of neonatal deaths, and a reduction in hyaline membrane disease. Neonatal mortality rates at the university center were not reduced, and the incidence of sequelae was not affected. These data suggest that for the smallest infant, intrapartum and immediate neonatal care at a tertiary center may decrease fetal mortality and neonatal morbidity rates. Neonatal mortality and long-term outcome, however, may be less affected.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies show that the age of an infant affects morphine clearance but that ventilatory effects from morphine infusions are similar at the same morphine steady-state concentration in infants and children after surgery. The presence of cyanotic heart disease in infants receiving postoperative morphine infusions was studied for its potential effect on ventilatory effort. METHODS: Twenty infants under 90 days of age (10 cyanotic, 10 acyanotic) received morphine intravenous infusions following thoracotomy. PaCO2 during spontaneous breathing, CO2 rebreathing trials during morphine infusions and time to wean from assisted mechanical ventilation after decreasing infusion rates were compared. Analgesia scoring in the first postoperative 24 h was also compared between cyanotic and acyanotic infants. RESULTS: PaCO2 during spontaneous breathing and CO2 response curve slopes were not different between groups. The time to wean from assisted mechanical ventilation after decreasing morphine infusion rates was not statistically different (median 6.9 h versus 5.8 h in cyanotic and acyanotic, respectively). Median morphine concentrations were higher in cyanotic infants at the time of ventilatory testing (32 versus 20.5 ng x ml-1 in cyanotic versus acyanotic infants, respectively, P = NS). Both groups had good pain relief. Steady-state morphine clearance rates showed two- to three-fold variability between infants. They were not statistically different in cyanotic versus acyanotic infants but tended to be lower in the cyanotic. Morphine clearance increased significantly with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: Morphine i.v. infusions given to infants following thoracotomy show the same ventilatory effects in infants with cyanotic heart disease as in acyanotic infants. Age is the more important determinant of morphine response by its effect on morphine clearance than cyanosis in infants aged less than 3 months.},

  Abstract                 = {Cyclin E is a critical G(1)-S cell cycle regulator aberrantly expressed in bronchial premalignancy and lung cancer. Cyclin E expression negatively affects lung cancer prognosis. Its role in lung carcinogenesis was explored. Retroviral cyclin E transduction promoted pulmonary epithelial cell growth, and small interfering RNA targeting of cyclin E repressed this growth. Murine transgenic lines were engineered to mimic aberrant cyclin E expression in the lung. Wild-type and proteasome degradation-resistant human cyclin E transgenic lines were independently driven by the human surfactant C (SP-C) promoter. Chromosome instability (CIN), pulmonary dysplasia, sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway activation, adenocarcinomas, and metastases occurred. Notably, high expression of degradation-resistant cyclin E frequently caused dysplasia and multiple lung adenocarcinomas. Thus, recapitulation of aberrant cyclin E expression as seen in human premalignant and malignant lung lesions reproduces in the mouse frequent features of lung carcinogenesis, including CIN, Shh pathway activation, dysplasia, single or multiple lung cancers, or presence of metastases. This article reports unique mouse lung cancer models that replicate many carcinogenic changes found in patients. These models provide insights into the carcinogenesis process and implicate cyclin E as a therapeutic target in the lung.},

With the decline in oestrogen levels, risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) become more apparent, especially hypertension. The onset of hypertension can cause a variety of complaints that are often attributed to the menopause. Risk factor identification is poorly managed in middle-aged women and should be the first step in the evaluation and treatment of women with perimenopausal symptoms. In women at low risk for CHD, there is still a window of opportunity for safe hormone prescription in the first years proximal to menopause. (Neth Heart J 2009;17:68-72.).},

The difficulties in performing a meta-analysis of individual patient data were recently illustrated in the IMPACT project (International Mission on Prognosis and Clinical Trial Design in TBI): merging data from 11 studies involved over 10 person years of work. However, these studies did confirm the great potential for advancing the field by this approach. Although randomized controlled trials remain the prime approach for investigating treatment effects, these can never address the many uncertainties concerning multiple treatment modalities in TBI. Pooling data from different studies may provide the best possible source of evidence we can get in a cost efficient way. Standardisation of data collection and coding is essential to this purpose. Recommendations hereto have been proposed by an interagency initiative in the US. These proposals deserve to be taken forward at an international level. This initiative may well constitute one of the most important steps forwards, paving the road for harvesting successful results in the near future.},

  Abstract                 = {Collaboration among investigators, centers, countries, and disciplines is essential to advancing the care for traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is thus important that we "speak the same language." Great variability, however, exists in data collection and coding of variables in TBI studies, confounding comparisons between and analysis across different studies. Randomized controlled trials can never address the many uncertainties concerning treatment approaches in TBI. Pooling data from different clinical studies and high-quality observational studies combined with comparative effectiveness research may provide excellent alternatives in a cost-efficient way. Standardization of data collection and coding is essential to this end. Common data elements (CDEs) are presented for demographics and clinical variables applicable across the broad spectrum of TBI. Most recommendations represent a consensus derived from clinical practice. Some recommendations concern novel approaches, for example assessment of the intensity of therapy in severely injured patients. Up to three levels of detail for coding data elements were developed: basic, intermediate, and advanced, with the greatest level of detail attained in the advanced version. More detailed codings can be collapsed into the basic version. Templates were produced to summarize coding formats, explanation of choices, and recommendations for procedures. Endorsement of the recommendations has been obtained from many authoritative organizations. The development of CDEs for TBI should be viewed as a continuing process; as more experience is gained, refinement and amendments will be required. This proposed process of standardization will facilitate comparative effectiveness research and encourage high-quality meta-analysis of individual patient data.},

  Abstract                 = {Comparing results across studies in traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been difficult because of the variability in data coding, definitions, and collection procedures. The global aim of the Working Group on Demographics and Clinical Assessment was to develop recommendations on the coding of clinical and demographic variables for TBI studies applicable across the broad spectrum of TBI, and to classify these as core, supplemental, or emerging. The process was consensus driven, with input from experts over a broad range of disciplines. Special consideration was given to military and pediatric TBI. Categorizing clinical elements as core versus supplemental proved difficult, given the great variation in types of studies and their interests. The data elements are contained in modules, which are grouped together in categories. Three levels of detail for coding data elements were developed: basic, intermediate, and advanced, with the greatest level of detail in the advanced version. In every case, the more detailed coding can be collapsed into the basic version. Templates were produced to summarize coding formats, motivation of choices, and recommendations for procedures. Work is ongoing to include more international participation and to provide an electronic data entry format with pull-down menus and automated data checks. This proposed standardization will facilitate comparison of research findings across studies and encourage high-quality meta-analysis of individual patient data.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The Marshall computed tomographic (CT) classification identifies six groups of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), based on morphological abnormalities on the CT scan. This classification is increasingly used as a predictor of outcome. We aimed to examine the predictive value of the Marshall CT classification in comparison with alternative CT models. METHODS: The predictive value was investigated in the Tirilazad trials (n = 2269). Alternative models were developed with logistic regression analysis and recursive partitioning. Six month mortality was used as outcome measure. Internal validity was assessed with bootstrapping techniques and expressed as the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). RESULTS: The Marshall CT classification indicated reasonable discrimination (AUC = 0.67), which could be improved by rearranging the underlying individual CT characteristics (AUC = 0.71). Performance could be further increased by adding intraventricular and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and by a more detailed differentiation of mass lesions and basal cisterns (AUC = 0.77). Models developed with logistic regression analysis and recursive partitioning showed similar performance. For clinical application we propose a simple CT score, which permits a more clear differentiation of prognostic risk, particularly in patients with mass lesions. CONCLUSION: It is preferable to use combinations of individual CT predictors rather than the Marshall CT classification for prognostic purposes in TBI. Such models should include at least the following parameters: status of basal cisterns, shift, traumatic subarachnoid or intraventricular hemorrhage, and presence of different types of mass lesions.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract During the National Neurotrauma Symposium 2010, the DG Research of the European Commission and the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NIH/NINDS) organized a workshop on comparative effectiveness research (CER) in traumatic brain injury (TBI). This workshop reviewed existing approaches to improve outcomes of TBI patients. It had two main outcomes: First, it initiated a process of re-orientation of clinical research in TBI. Second, it provided ideas for a potential collaboration between the European Commission and the NIH/NINDS to stimulate research in TBI. Advances in provision of care for TBI patients have resulted from observational studies, guideline development, and meta-analyses of individual patient data. In contrast, randomized controlled trials have not led to any identifiable major advances. Rigorous protocols and tightly selected populations constrain generalizability. The workshop addressed additional research approaches, summarized the greatest unmet needs, and highlighted priorities for future research. The collection of high-quality clinical databases, associated with systems biology and CER, offers substantial opportunities. Systems biology aims to identify multiple factors contributing to a disease and addresses complex interactions. Effectiveness research aims to measure benefits and risks of systems of care and interventions in ordinary settings and broader populations. These approaches have great potential for TBI research. Although not new, they still need to be introduced to and accepted by TBI researchers as instruments for clinical research. As with therapeutic targets in individual patient management, so it is with research tools: one size does not fit all.},

  Abstract                 = {Research in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is challenging for several reasons; in particular, the heterogeneity between patients regarding causes, pathophysiology, treatment, and outcome. Advances in basic science have failed to translate into successful clinical treatments, and the evidence underpinning guideline recommendations is weak. Because clinical research has been hampered by non-standardised data collection, restricted multidisciplinary collaboration, and the lack of sensitivity of classification and efficacy analyses, multidisciplinary collaborations are now being fostered. Approaches to deal with heterogeneity have been developed by the IMPACT study group. These approaches can increase statistical power in clinical trials by up to 50\% and are also relevant to other heterogeneous neurological diseases, such as stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Rather than trying to limit heterogeneity, we might also be able to exploit it by analysing differences in treatment and outcome between countries and centres in comparative effectiveness research. This approach has great potential to advance care in patients with TBI.},

DESIGN: A prospective, cohort design to collect and analyze clinical variables relevant for diagnosing co-occurring TBI. SETTING: An urban, single-center National Institute of Disability and Rehabilitation Research Model Spinal Cord Injury System in the Southeastern United States. PARTICIPANTS: People (N=198) who met inclusion criteria and provided consent within an 18-month recruitment window. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: FIM cognitive scale. RESULTS: Based on participants' presence and duration of posttraumatic amnesia, initial Glasgow Coma Scale total score, and presence of cerebral lesion documented by neuroimaging, 60% of our traumatic SCI sample also sustained a TBI (n=118). Most co-occurring TBIs were mild (34%). Co-occurring mild complicated (10%), moderate (6%), and severe TBI (10%) were less common but still occurred in a significant percentage (26%) of persons with traumatic SCI. Persons with traumatic SCI who were injured in motor vehicle collisions and falls were more likely to sustain a co-occurring TBI. Cervical level traumatic SCI was associated with greater rates of TBI but not more severe injuries. Tree analyses established a practical algorithm for classifying TBI severity associated with traumatic SCI. Analysis of variance established criterion validity for the algorithm's TBI severity classifications. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from our prospective study provide strong support that TBI is a common co-occurring injury with traumatic SCI. Incomplete acute care medical record documentation of TBI in the traumatic SCI population remains a considerable issue, and there is a significant need to educate emergency department and acute care personnel on the TBI clinical data needs of acute rehabilitation providers. A systematic algorithm for reviewing acute care medical records can yield valid estimates of TBI severity in the traumatic SCI population.},

  Abstract                 = {Hospital discharge data for all adult trauma admissions (n = 27,029) to acute care hospitals in a five-county area were used to examine the effect of pre-existing chronic conditions (PECs) on length of hospital stay (LOS). The per cent increase in mean LOS and the relative odds of an extended LOS (i.e., greater than or equal to 3 weeks) were estimated for surviving trauma patients with and without one or more of 11 pre-existing medical conditions, taking into account both the ISS severity of injuries and patient age. Nineteen per cent (n = 5,224) of the trauma cases had one or more of the 11 PECs; 5% (n = 1,384) had two or more PECs. Those with one or more PECs stayed significantly longer (p less than 0.001) than those who had none. Mean LOS was shown to be 69% higher for those with versus those without PECs. Furthermore, patients with PECs were more than twice as likely as those without PECs to have stayed in the hospital 3 weeks or longer. The size of the effect, however, varied by patient age and injury severity; the effect of PECs on length of stay was larger among younger patients and patients with less severe injuries. With regionalization, trauma centers treat the majority of these patients and potentially suffer disproportionate financial losses when reimbursement is based on DRGs.},

  Abstract                 = {This report describes the development and validation of a computerized system for converting ICD-9CM rubrics to Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) scores. In collaboration with the Committee on Injury Scaling of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, AIS-85 scores were assigned to 2,062 injury-related ICD-9CM rubrics. To validate the conversion table, AIS and Injury Severity Scores (ISS), derived using the conversion, were compared with those obtained by reviewing the complete medical record for 1,120 trauma cases. Percent agreement in maximum AIS scores (MAXAIS) ranged from 48% for head/neck injuries to 74% for extremity injuries. In 68% of the cases, grouped ISS scores (one to 12; 13 to 19; 20+) were in agreement. Previous studies of the interrater reliability of AIS coding directly from the medical charts have shown that agreement in MAXAIS scores ranges, on average, between 62% for head/neck injuries to 76% for extremity injuries. Grouped ISS scores agree, on average, 75% of the time. The results show that while the computerized conversion is not perfect, it provides reasonably good information on severity that might otherwise be unavailable for large population-based research and evaluation. This paper discusses the potential applications of the conversion table with specific attention to its use in evaluating the extent of trauma care regionalization.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Concern about harm to newborns from early postpartum discharges led to laws establishing minimum hospital stays in the mid-1990s. We evaluated the effects of an early-discharge protocol (a hospital stay of one postpartum night plus a home visit) in a health maintenance organization (HMO) and a subsequent state law guaranteeing a 48-hour hospital stay. METHODS: Using interrupted-time-series analysis and data on 20,366 mother-infant pairs with normal vaginal deliveries, we measured changes in length of stay, newborn examinations on the third or fourth day of life, and office visits, emergency department visits, and hospital readmissions for newborns. We also examined expenditures for hospitalizations and home-based care. RESULTS: The early-discharge program increased the rate of stays of less than two nights from 29.0 percent to 65.6 percent (P<0.001). The rate declined to 13.7 percent after the state mandate (P<0.001). The rate of newborn examinations on the third or fourth day of life increased from 24.5 percent to 64.4 percent with the program (P<0.001), then dropped to 53.0 percent after the mandate (P<0.001)--changes that primarily reflected changes in the rate of home visits. The rate of nonurgent visits to a health center increased from 33.4 percent to 44.7 percent (P<0.001) after the reduced-stay program was implemented. There were no significant changes in the rate of emergency department visits (quarterly mean, 1.1 percent) or rehospitalizations (quarterly mean, 1.5 percent). Results were similar for a vulnerable subgroup with lower incomes, younger maternal age, a lower level of education, or some combination of these characteristics. Average HMO expenditures on hospital and home-based services decreased by $90 per delivery with the early-discharge program and increased by $100 after the mandate. CONCLUSIONS: Neither policy appears to have affected the health outcomes of newborns. After the mandate, newborns were less likely to be examined as recommended on day 3 or 4. Because of changes in hospital prices, the two policies had minimal effects on HMO expenditures for hospital and home-based services.},

  Abstract                 = {Our emergency department (ED) observation unit specifically excludes patients with "significant" electrocardiogram (EKG) findings, but patients may be admitted with "nonspecific" EKG findings. We evaluated whether physician documentation of nonspecific findings predicted eventual admission to an inpatient unit from the observation unit. We reviewed the charts of all chest pain patients admitted to our ED observation unit over a 14-month period. We recorded patients as having documented nonspecific EKG findings if the ED physician stated in the chart that the patient had nonspecific ST segment, T-wave, or Q-wave findings. We recorded baseline characteristics and admission rates among patients. Results were analyzed with chi2 statistics. Five hundred thirty-one chest pain patients were admitted to the observation unit during the study period, and 79 patients (14.9%) had documented nonspecific EKG findings. Patients (22.8%) with documented nonspecific EKG findings were admitted to an inpatient unit from the observation unit, compared with 14.2% of patients without documented nonspecific EKG findings (P = 0.041). Patients with documented nonspecific EKG changes also had higher rates of positive stress testing (17.5% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.103) and stent placement (5.1% vs. 3.3%, P = 0.309), although these were not statistically significant. Patients with documented nonspecific EKG findings were admitted to an inpatient unit from the observation unit at higher rates than those without these findings. Physicians may wish to use the ED EKG more effectively in screening patients for admission to the ED observation unit.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Recent research has noted low rates of compliance among ED chest pain patients referred for outpatient stress testing. The practice at our institution, a 39,000 visits per year emergency department (ED), is to place chest pain patients considered low risk for acute coronary syndrome in an observation unit for serial biomarker testing and provocative cardiac testing. Our objective was to determine the rates of positive stress tests among this group and to extrapolate from this the potential missed positive stress tests if these patients were referred instead for outpatient stress testing. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of all chest pain patients admitted to the ED observation unit between April 2006 and June 2007. Baseline information, including a history of coronary disease, was recorded. Patients underwent a treadmill stress test, nuclear stress test, or coronary CT scan at the discretion of the attending emergency physician and/or the consulting cardiologist. Rates of positive stress test or coronary CT and patient disposition (admission to an inpatient unit versus discharge for outpatient follow-up) were noted. RESULTS: A total of 353 patients underwent stress testing or coronary CT during the study period: 257 (72.8%) patients had an exercise treadmill echocardiogram, 61 (17.3%) patients underwent nuclear stress testing, and 35 (9.9%) patients had a coronary CT. Seventy patients (19.8%) had a history of coronary disease but had been considered appropriate for observation by the attending emergency physician. Thirty-nine stress tests were positive (11%) and 11 were indeterminate (3.1%). Among patients with no history of coronary disease, 20 stress tests were positive (7.1%), and 10 were indeterminate (3.5%). Of all patients with a positive stress test, 19 (48.7%) underwent cardiac catheterization and 1 (2.6%) had coronary artery bypass graft. Twenty-one of 39 patients with a positive stress test (54%) were ultimately admitted to an inpatient unit per the recommendation of the consulting cardiologist. Assuming a best-case scenario in which 70% of patients referred for outpatient stress testing actually have the testing done (based on a recent report of outpatient compliance), physicians would miss approximately 3.3% of patients with a positive stress test if these patients were discharged directly from the ED. CONCLUSION: Among chest pain patients admitted to an ED observation unit, the rate of positive stress tests was 11%. Approximately 3.3% of patients with positive stress tests may have been missed if these patients were instead referred for outpatient testing.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: At this 35 000 visits/year emergency department (ED) at a level one trauma centre, a trauma protocol was implemented for the ED observation unit. Data on all trauma observation unit admissions were then collected to evaluate for safety, efficiency and admission rates. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of all trauma patients in the observation unit during a 14-month period. Exclusion criteria for observation unit admission included: abnormal vital signs, positive focussed abdominal sonography for trauma examination, abnormal ECG, abnormal chest radiograph, abnormal head computed tomography, Glasgow coma score less than 14, or multisystem trauma. RESULTS: 364 trauma patients were admitted to the observation unit. 84.6% were trauma II activations and 3.8% were trauma I activations. There were no deaths, intubations, loss of vital signs or other adverse events. The average length of stay was 12 h 46 minutes and 11.5% of patients were admitted to an inpatient unit. At 30-day follow-up, there were no significant missed injuries. CONCLUSION: The observation unit is a safe alternative to inpatient admission for the evaluation of the minimally injured trauma activation patient.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Given radiation- and sedation-associated risks, there is uncertainty about which children with head trauma should receive cranial computed tomography (CT) scanning. A high-quality and high-performing clinical prediction rule may reduce this uncertainty. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the quality and performance of published clinical prediction rules for intracranial injury in children with head injury. METHODS: Medline and Embase were searched in December 2008. Studies were selected if they included clinical prediction rules involving children aged 0 to 18 years with a history of head injury. Prediction-rule quality was assessed by using 14 previously published items. Prediction-rule performance was evaluated by rule sensitivity and the predicted frequency of CT scanning if the rule was used. RESULTS: A total of 3357 titles and abstracts were assessed, and 8 clinical prediction rules were identified. For all studies, the rule derivations were reported; no study validated a rule in a separate population or assessed its impact in actual practice. The rules differed considerably in population, predictors, outcomes, methodologic quality, and performance. Five of the rules were applicable to children of all ages and severities of trauma. Two of these were high quality (>or=11 of 14 quality items) and had high performance (lower confidence limits for sensitivity >0.95 and required <or=56% to undergo CT). Four of the 8 rules were applicable to children with minor head injury (Glasgow coma score >or=13). One of these had high quality (11 of 14 quality items) and high performance (lower confidence limit for sensitivity = 0.94 and required 13% to undergo CT). Four of the 8 rules were applicable to young children, but none exhibited adequate quality or performance. CONCLUSIONS: Eight clinical prediction-rule derivation studies were identified. They varied considerably in population, methodologic quality, and performance. Future efforts should be directed toward validating rules with high quality and performance in other populations and deriving a high-quality, high-performance rule for young children.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The number of adults with congenital heart disease who require cardiac surgery is projected to increase dramatically. Controversy exists as to whether such procedures should be performed in pediatric centers, which generally have the greatest experience with operations for congenital heart disease. We sought to report the outcomes for cardiac surgery performed in adults (>or=21 years of age) at children's hospitals and determine how these practices varied among institutions. METHODS: Data from July 2005 to June 2007 from the Child Health Corporation of America, a consortium of 37 free-standing children's hospitals, were analyzed to determine the institutional volume, type of cardiac procedure, outcome, and hospital charges. Individual institutional variables were analyzed to determine which factors might be associated with the practice of performing adult cardiac surgery in children's hospitals. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 719 admissions for cardiac surgery in adults at Child Health Corporation of America institutions. The median age at the time of operation was 26 years (range, 21-86 years). The most common surgical procedures were implantation or revision of a pacemaker or defibrillator (n = 207 [29.2%]), pulmonary valve replacement (n = 119 [16.8%]), aortic valve replacement (n = 59 [8.3%]), and Fontan revision (n = 37 [5.2%]). The median hospital length of stay was 6 days (range, 1-175 days). The hospital mortality was 1.9%. Comorbid conditions likely to require other subspecialty care were present in more than 30% of patients. Among the Child Health Corporation of America centers, adult operations as a proportion of overall cardiac operations varied from 0% to 10.9%. There was no relationship between overall cardiac surgical volume and proportion of adult cases performed in Child Health Corporation of America centers. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of adult cardiac surgical procedures are being performed at children's hospitals with excellent results. The majority of procedures are not related to complex shunt lesions but rather pacemaker/defibrillator implantation and semilunar valve surgery. Whether adult patients with congenital heart disease should continue to undergo most cardiac surgery in children's hospitals is worthy of discussion.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Some children with perinatal HIV infection develop early progression to severe symptoms (Category C) within the first 4 years of life. Prophylactic therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may affect progression by decreasing the incidence of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). METHODS: HIV progression to Category C in the first 3 years of life was retrospectively analyzed in a population-based cohort of children with perinatal HIV infection followed for > or = 3 years from birth. Time to development of Category C and clinical patterns of new Category C diagnoses were examined in relation to patterns of PCP prophylaxis before diagnosis. RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 147 children developed 67 initial category C diseases by 3 years of age: PCP (n=24), encephalopathy (n=22), other opportunistic infections (n=19) and wasting (n=2). Before diagnosis therapy included TMP/ SMX and zidovudine (ZDV) (n=11), TMP/SMX alone (n=7), ZDV alone (n=1) and neither (n= 39). The probability of developing a Category C diagnosis after 2 years was significantly lower among children who received TMP/SMX compared with those who did not (29%, TMP/SMX vs. 45%, no TMP/SMX; 30%, TMP and ZDV vs. 45%, no therapy; P < 0.01). The frequency of PCP was significantly lower and that of HIV encephalopathy was significantly higher among children receiving TMP/SMX +/- ZDV before Category C diagnosis than among children receiving neither. CONCLUSION: In this study PCP prophylaxis was associated with longer time to Category C diagnoses in the first 3 years of life. This association was related to a decreased incidence of PCP and an increased incidence of encephalopathy as the first Category C diagnosis among children who received TMP/SMX.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To describe simple estimates of likely duration of stay for very premature babies born in the UK and discharged home. DESIGN: Statistical modelling of data from thirty neonatal units in a geographically defined region of the UK. PARTICIPANTS: All babies born at 23 to 32 completed weeks of gestation in 2005, 2006 and 2007 who were discharged home with the expectation that they would survive. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Total duration of stay in the neonatal service. RESULTS: 5528 babies were initially identified. 558 (10.1%) who died or who did not follow a normal care pathway were excluded. In a further 27, data were either missing or inadequate, leaving a study population of 4702 babies. As expected, gestation and birthweight exhibited strong influence on length of stay. Of the other variables tested, initial reason for admission (need for early respiratory support) showed the most consistent association. These factors were combined to produce predictive tables. The predictive performance of the tables was found to fit the data well for various groups, with the exception of multiple births who tended to have longer stays. However, when tested against individual units, much greater variation was seen independent of unit size and case mix. CONCLUSION: The prediction tables should permit parents to make sensible estimates about the duration of their baby's stay in the neonatal service; however, there appear to be important differences between units. The variation noted in length of stay between otherwise similar units merits further investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To validate Clinical Risk Index for Babies (CRIB) and CRIB II mortality prediction scores in a UK population of infants born at </=32 weeks' gestation, and investigate CRIB II calculated without admission temperature. METHODS: Infants born at 22-32 weeks' gestation to mothers resident in a UK region in 2005-2006 admitted for neonatal care were identified. Predictive probabilities for mortality were calculated using CRIB, CRIB II and CRIB II without admission temperature (CRIB II((-T))) using published algorithms and after recalibration. Predictive performance was investigated overall and for groups defined by gestation and admission temperature and summarised by area under receiver-operating curve, Cox's regression, Brier scores and Spiegelhalter's z-scores. RESULTS: 3268 infants were included: 317 (9.7%) died before discharge. Using published algorithms each score showed excellent discrimination (area under the curve = 0.92). The total number of deaths was predicted well for CRIB (324.4) but for both versions of CRIB II the number of deaths was underpredicted (255.2 and 216.6). All scores performed poorly for subgroups. After recalibration CRIB II displayed excellent predictive characteristics overall (Spiegelhalter's z-score p = 0.52) and in the gestation groups (p = 0.44 and 0.57) but not for the temperature groups (p = 0.026 and 0.97). CRIB II((-T)) displayed excellent predictive characteristics for all groups: overall p = 0.53; gestation groups p = 0.64 and 0.42; temperature groups p = 0.42 and 0.66. CONCLUSIONS: The published algorithm for CRIB II was poorly calibrated but simple linear recalibration provided good results. The CRIB II score without admission temperature showed good predictive characteristics once recalibrated and this version of the score should be used when benchmarking mortality in neonatal intensive care units.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Estimates of the probability of survival of very preterm infants admitted to NICU care are vital for counseling parents, informing care, and planning services. In 1999, easy-to-use charts of survival according to gestation, birth weight, and gender were published in the United Kingdom. These charts are widely used in clinical care and for benchmarking survival, and they form the core of the Clinical Risk Index for Babies II score. Since their publication, the survival of preterm infants has improved, and the charts therefore need updating. METHODS: A logistic model was fitted with gestational age, birth weight, and gender. Nonlinear functions were estimated by using fractional polynomials. Bootstrap methods were used to assess the internal validity of the final model. The final model was assessed both overall and for subgroups of infants by using Farrington's statistic, the c-statistic, Cox regression coefficients, and the Brier score. RESULTS: A total of 2995 white singleton infants born at 23(+0) to 32(+6) weeks' gestation in 2008 through 2010 were identified; 2751 (91.9%) infants survived to discharge. A prediction model was estimated and good model fit confirmed (area under receiver-operating characteristics curve = 0.86). Survival ranged from 27.7% (23 weeks) to 99.1% (32 weeks) for boys and from 34.5% (23 weeks) to 99.3% (32 weeks) for girls. Updated charts were produced showing estimated survival according to gestation, birth weight and gender, together with contour plots displaying points of equal survival. CONCLUSIONS: These survival charts have been updated and will be of use to clinicians, parents, and managers.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Retrospective studies have suggested an association between systemic hypotension and hypoxia and worsened outcome from traumatic brain injury. Little is known, however, about the frequency and duration of these potentially preventable causes of secondary brain injury. HYPOTHESIS: Early episodes of hypoxia and hypotension occurring during initial resuscitation will have a significant impact on outcome following traumatic brain injury. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Urban level I trauma center. PATIENTS: Patients with a traumatic brain injury who had a Glasgow Coma Score of 12 or less within the first 24 hours of admission to the hospital and computed tomographic scan results demonstrating intracranial pathologic features. Patients who died in the emergency department were excluded from the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Automated blood pressure and pulse oximetry readings were collected prospectively from the time of arrival through initial resuscitation. The number and duration of hypotensive (systolic blood pressure, < or =90 mm Hg) and hypoxic (oxygen saturation, < or =92%) events were analyzed for their association with mortality and neurological outcome. RESULTS: One hundred seven patients met the enrollment criteria (median Glasgow Coma Score, 7). Overall mortality was 43%. Twenty-six patients (24%) had hypotension while in the emergency department, with an average of 1.5 episodes per patient (mean duration, 9.1 minutes). Of these 26 patients with hypotension, 17 (65%) died (P =.01). When the number of hypotensive episodes increased from 1 to 2 or more, the odds ratio for death increased from 2.1 to 8.1. Forty-one patients (38%) had hypoxia, with an average of 2.1 episodes per patient (mean duration, 8.7 minutes). Of these 41 patients with hypoxia, 18 (44%) died (P =.68). CONCLUSIONS: Hypotension, but not hypoxia, occurring in the initial phase of resuscitation is significantly (P =.009) associated with increased mortality following brain injury, even when episodes are relatively short. These prospective data reinforce the need for early continuous monitoring and improved treatment of hypotension in brain-injured patients.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Statewide trauma registries have proliferated in the last decade, suggesting that information could be aggregated to provide an accurate depiction of serious injury in the United States. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether variability exists in the composition and content of statewide trauma registries, specifically addressing case-acquisition, case-definition (inclusion criteria), and registry-coding conventions. METHODS: A cross-sectional, two-part survey was administered to managers of all statewide trauma registries. State trauma registrars also provided inclusion and exclusion criteria from their state registry and abstracted a clinical vignette designed to identify coding inconsistencies. RESULTS: Thirty-two states maintain a centralized registry, but requirements for data submission vary significantly. Inclusion and exclusion criteria also vary, particularly for nontraumatic injuries. Coding conventions adopted by states for vague or missing information are dissimilar. When abstractions of the clinical vignette are compared, only 19% and 47% of states provided similar quantity or content for injury e-coding and diagnostic coding, respectively. Injury severity scores (based on diagnostic coding) demonstrated a range from 2 to 18. CONCLUSIONS: Statewide trauma registries are prevalent but vary significantly in composition and content. Standardizing inclusion criteria, variable definitions, and coding conventions would greatly enhance the usability of an aggregated, national trauma registry.},

METHODS: Statewide death certificate, inpatient, ED, and EMS databases for 1996 through 1997 were probabilistically linked and information in each database compared. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred ninety-four injured inpatients or ED patients were matched with a death certificate record that listed an injury (56.3%) or illness (43.7%) as the primary cause of death. Injured decedents with an illness-coded cause of death were older (p < 0.001), with causes of death indicative of chronic medical conditions. Few deaths occurred within 30 days of inpatient discharge (6%); however, 38% and 9% of deaths in ED and EMS databases occurred after discharge from health care, respectively. Many deaths among EMS and ED patients occur in subsequent phases of care. CONCLUSION: Estimates of injury mortality substantially increase when using multiple independent databases.},

RESULTS: States continue to value the formalization of trauma systems. System operations, evaluation/research methods and trauma leadership are highly valued by states with mature systems. However, all states consider their trauma system severely threatened by inadequate funding and difficulty recruiting and retaining physicians and nurses. CONCLUSION: Trauma care systems are valued and demonstrate potential for future expansion. However, economic shortfalls and retention of medical personnel threaten the viability of current systems across the U.S.},

At the start of the consensus conference, 49 attendees participated in a survey containing three sections: 1) demographic questions characterizing respondents, 2) questions regarding application of the FDA Final Rule, and 3) complexities associated with seeking informed consent in an emergency setting. Consensus analysis was used to determine if a formal consensus was reached, relying on a Bayesian posterior probability of 0.99 to consider survey responses a "consensus." Respondents demonstrated consensus regarding the need to further refine and standardize application of the FDA Final Rule in resuscitation research. However, participants agreed that current regulations provide adequate and appropriate protection to safeguard patients. Complexities associated with seeking informed consent in emergency departments were prevalent among most institutions represented at the conference. There was general agreement that current efforts to safeguard human subjects are effective, but participants agreed that refinements to and standardization of the FDA Final Rule would facilitate resuscitation research and enhance patient safety.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to identify patient and hospital characteristics associated with the use of computed tomography (CT) imaging of the cervical spine (c-spine) in the evaluation of injured children and, in particular, to examine the influence of hospital setting. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort of children younger than 19 years of age from the Massachusetts Hospital Emergency Department (ED) database who were discharged from the ED with an injury diagnosis from 2005 through 2009. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze characteristics associated with CT imaging of the c-spine. RESULTS: Of the 929,626 pediatric patients diagnosed with an injury in Massachusetts EDs and then discharged home, 1.3% underwent CT imaging of the c-spine. Rates of CT imaging nearly doubled over the 5 years. In the multivariable model, patient age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.0 to 2.7 for children age 12 to 18 years vs. under 1 year of age) and evaluation outside of a pediatric Level I trauma center (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.1 to 4.3 for children evaluated at non Level I trauma centers vs. pediatric Level I trauma centers; AOR = 2.1, 95% CI = 0.93 to 4.7 for children evaluated at adult Level I trauma centers vs. pediatric Level I trauma centers) were associated with higher rates of CT imaging of the c-spine. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical spine CT imaging for children discharged from the ED with trauma diagnoses increased from 2005 through 2009. Older age and evaluation outside a Level I pediatric trauma center were associated with a higher c-spine CT rate. Educational interventions focused outside pediatric trauma centers may be an effective approach to decreasing CT imaging of the c-spine of pediatric trauma patients.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Previous research assessing the impact of between-hospital trauma volume (high volume centers vs. low volume centers) and outcomes has been inconsistent. Furthermore, previous research has not considered temporal variations in within-hospital volume (a center having higher than average volume vs. lower than average volume) as a covariate. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship of between-hospital and within-hospital trauma volume and two measures of hospital quality of care. DESIGN: Multivariable, hierarchical, mixed effects, logistic regression analyses of a population-based nonconcurrent cohort from 1995 to 1999. SETTING: Thirty-nine nonfederal California hospitals included in the California Patient Discharge Data Set designated by local Emergency Medical Services authorities as adult trauma centers. PATIENTS: All nonelderly adult trauma patients, 16-64 yrs (n = 54,352), and elderly adult trauma patients, >65 yrs (n = 47,656), admitted with an Injury Severity Score >9. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Severity adjusted in-hospital mortality rate and 30-day trauma-related readmissions were analyzed. Among nonelderly adult patients, higher annual between-hospital trauma volume was not associated with mortality rate (odds ratio, 1.02 for each 100 admissions; 95% confidence interval, 0.99, 1.06) but was associated with higher risk of readmission (odds ratio, 1.19 for each 100 admissions; 95% confidence interval, 1.13, 1.26). Among elderly adult patients, higher annual between-hospital trauma volume was associated with lower mortality (odds ratio, 0.79 for each 100 admissions; 95% confidence interval, 0.71, 0.87) but was not associated with risk of readmission (odds ratio, 0.96 for each 100 admissions; 95% confidence interval, 0.90, 1.04). Higher than average monthly within-hospital trauma volume was associated with higher odds of readmission (odds ratio, 1.11 for a volume deviation of ten patients per month; 95% confidence interval, 1.01, 1.21) among elderly adult patients. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study in the context of previous research suggest that relationships between trauma volume and outcomes exist but depend on which patient populations are studied and how the data are analyzed. Furthermore, trauma centers may be subject to the detrimental effects of high temporal volume overextending existing services and capacity. Since this study found that both between-hospital volume and within-hospital volume measures are associated with outcomes, we recommend that both measures be included in future volume-outcome investigations.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Injured pediatric patients in remote communities are often cared for at trauma centers that may be underserved with respect to pediatric specialty services. The objective of this study is to describe a pilot telemedicine project that allows a remote trauma center's adult intensive care unit to obtain nontrauma, nonsurgical-related pediatric critical care consultations for acutely injured children. DESIGN: Nonconcurrent cohort design. SETTING: A remote, level II trauma center's shock-trauma intensive care unit and a tertiary care children's hospital pediatric intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Analyses were conducted on cohorts of pediatric trauma patients (<16 yrs) consecutively admitted to the remote adult intensive care unit, including historical control patients and patients who received and did not receive telemedicine consultations. INTERVENTIONS: Telemedicine consultations were obtained at the discretion of the remote intensive care unit provider for nontrauma, nonsurgical medical issues. Measurements and RESULTS: The Injury Severity Score and Trauma and Injury Severity Score were used to assess severity of injury and predicted mortality rates, respectively, for the patient cohorts. Parental and provider satisfaction with the telemedicine consultations was also described. Thirty-nine consultations were conducted on 17 patients from the 97 pediatric patients admitted during the 2-yr study. Patients who received consultations were younger (5.5 yrs vs. 13.3 yrs, p <.01) and were more severely injured (mean Injury Severity Score = 18.3 vs. 14.7, p =.07). Severity-adjusted mortality rates were consistent with Trauma and Injury Severity Score expectations. Satisfaction surveys suggested a high level of provider and parental satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our report of a trauma intensive care unit based pediatric critical care telemedicine program demonstrates that telemedicine consultations to a remote intensive care unit are feasible and suggests a high level of satisfaction among providers and parents.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECT: The goal of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic window for hypothermia treatment following experimental brain injury by measuring edema formation and functional outcome. METHODS: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was produced in anesthetized rats by using cortical impact injury. Edema was measured in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres by subtracting dry weight from wet weight, and neurological function was assessed using a battery of behavioral tests 24 hours after TBI. In injured rats, it was found that brain water levels were elevated at I hour postinjury, compared with those in sham-injured control animals, and that edema peaked at 24 hours and remained elevated for 4 days. Hypothermia (3 hours at 30 degrees C) induced either immediately after TBI or 60 minutes after TBI significantly reduced early neurological deficits. Delay of treatment by 90 or 120 minutes postinjury did not result in this neurological protection. Immediate administration of hypothermia also significantly decreased the peak magnitude of edema at 24 hours and 48 hours postinjury, compared with that in normothermic injured control animals. When delayed by 90 minutes, hypothermia did not affect the pattern of edema formation. CONCLUSIONS: When hypothermia was administered immediately or 60 minutes after TBI, injured rats showed an improvement in functional outcome and a decrease in edema. Delayed hypothermia treatment had no effect on functional outcome or on edema.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Systemic corticosteroids remain controversial in the treatment of pediatric patients with severe sepsis. Recent studies in septic adults have shown decreased mortality with the use of hydrocortisone in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency. We conducted this large retrospective cohort study to further characterize severe sepsis in infants and children and correlates of outcome, including the use of steroids.Design: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), an administrative database of the Child Health Corporation of America (CHCA), was queried for inpatients 0-17 yrs of age with severe sepsis (defined here as an International Classification of Disease 9th edition code for infection with use of simultaneous mechanical ventilation and vasoactive infusions) from 2001 to 2002. In addition to demographic information, use of systemic corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, or dexamethasone) concurrent with the ventilatory and vasoactive support was collected. SUBJECTS: Data from PHIS. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients (n = 6693) were identified at 27 PHIS-participating CHCA member hospitals. Overall mortality was 24%; univariate predictors of death included use of steroids (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7, 2.2), older age (e.g., 13-17 yrs vs. neonates; OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3, 2.0), a hematologic-oncologic diagnosis (OR, 5.87; 95% CI, 4.19, 8.23), and moderate vs. high case volume (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.09, 1.44). Age, hematologic-oncologic diagnosis, case volume, and use of steroids remained independent predictors of mortality in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: From this administrative database analysis, there is no evidence that steroids are associated with improved outcome in critically ill infants and children with sepsis. Although steroids may be given preferentially to more severely ill children, their use was associated with increased mortality.

  Abstract                 = {Reported increases in the number of fractures of the proximal femur in Europe are greater than can be explained by demographic changes alone. This trend was assessed in Canada by examining hospital discharge records from the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba from 1972 to 1984. The annual number of first fractures of the proximal femur in persons older than 50 years of age increased 59.7% in women and 42.2% in men during this time period. In most of the five-year age groups the percentage of increase in the number of fractures exceeded the percentage of increase in population of that age group. Annual age-specific incidences (by five-year age groups) increased exponentially with age, doubling every six years, and reached a maximum value of 4% in women older than 90 years of age. Annual age-adjusted incidences increased significantly over the study period in men and women. For the whole of Canada in 1987, it is estimated that there were 13,193 first fractures of the proximal femur in women and 4610 in men, and that in the year 2006 these will rise to 22,922 and 7846, respectively. The actual increase will be considerably greater if the age-specific incidences continue to increase as they have from 1972 to 1984. The gradual decline in physical activity, which contributes to bone loss, may be one etiological factor of this trend during the last half century.},

We investigated the epidemiology of sepsis in the United States, with specific examination of race and sex, causative organisms, the disposition of patients, and the incidence and outcome. METHODS: We analyzed the occurrence of sepsis from 1979 through 2000 using a nationally representative sample of all nonfederal acute care hospitals in the United States. Data on new cases were obtained from hospital discharge records coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. RESULTS: Review of discharge data on approximately 750 million hospitalizations in the United States over the 22-year period identified 10,319,418 cases of sepsis. Sepsis was more common among men than among women (mean annual relative risk, 1.28 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.24 to 1.32]) and among nonwhite persons than among white persons (mean annual relative risk, 1.90 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.81 to 2.00]). Between 1979 and 2000, there was an annualized increase in the incidence of sepsis of 8.7 percent, from about 164,000 cases (82.7 per 100,000 population) to nearly 660,000 cases (240.4 per 100,000 population). The rate of sepsis due to fungal organisms increased by 207 percent, with gram-positive bacteria becoming the predominant pathogens after 1987. The total in-hospital mortality rate fell from 27.8 percent during the period from 1979 through 1984 to 17.9 percent during the period from 1995 through 2000, yet the total number of deaths continued to increase. Mortality was highest among black men. Organ failure contributed cumulatively to mortality, with temporal improvements in survival among patients with fewer than three failing organs. The average length of the hospital stay decreased, and the rate of discharge to nonacute care medical facilities increased. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of sepsis and the number of sepsis-related deaths are increasing, although the overall mortality rate among patients with sepsis is declining. There are also disparities among races and between men and women in the incidence of sepsis. Gram-positive bacteria and fungal organisms are increasingly common causes of sepsis.},

In each setting, the continuum of care includes emergency medical services, intensive and acute medical care, inpatient rehabilitation, and a spectrum of community rehabilitation services.Eight hundred ninety-five rehabilitation patients admitted to acute care within 24 hours of traumatic brain injury between 1989 and 1999 were examined at 1-year follow-up.Incidence and cause of rehospitalization at 1 and 5 years after injury.The incidence of rehospitalization ranged from 22.9\% 1 year after injury to 17.0\% at 5 years after injury. At 1 year after injury, a third of the rehospitalizations were for elective reasons. At 5 years after injury, the incidence of readmissions for seizures and psychiatric difficulties and general health maintenance increased substantially. T-tests and chi-square analyses were performed on the 5-year follow-up data to compare those rehospitalized for unplanned reasons with those not rehospitalized.There remains a relatively high rate of rehospitalization in the long term after traumatic brain injury.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Outcomes data for adults undergoing congenital heart surgery are limited. Previous analyses used administrative data or focused on single-center outcomes. We describe the most common operations, patient characteristics, and postoperative outcomes using a multicenter clinical database. METHODS: The study included adults (aged >/= 18 years) listed in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (2000-2009). We describe patient characteristics and morbidity and mortality, and examine congenital procedures in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database to permit consideration of the primary dataset within a broader context. RESULTS: A total of 5265 patients (68 centers) from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database were included. Patients' median age was 25 years (interquartile range, 20-35). Common preoperative risk factors included noncardiac abnormalities (17%) and arrhythmia (14%). Overall, in-hospital mortality was 2.1%, 27% had 1 or more complication, and median length of stay was 5 days. Common operations included right ventricular outflow tract procedures (21%) and pacemaker/arrhythmia procedures (20%). We further evaluated cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in more than 100 patients. Mortality ranged from 0% (atrial septal defect repair) to 11% (Fontan revision/conversion). Separate evaluation of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database revealed 39,872 adults undergoing congenital heart operations. CONCLUSIONS: Most adult congenital heart operations listed in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database are performed in the third to fourth decades of life; approximately half are for right heart pathology or arrhythmia. Many patients have complications, but mortality is low with the exception of those undergoing Fontan revision/conversion. Many more adults undergoing congenital heart surgery are entered into the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database.},

  Abstract                 = {Electronic data linkage is increasingly being used by researchers and health professionals in the birth defects field as a tool for enhancing both research and service/care. However, in many cases, a common pre-existing ID number does not exist across different datasets, and common identifiers, such as names or dates of birth, which could be used to match records, may be known to contain errors or even legitimate differences over time. In such situations, probabilistic matching, which does not require that all identifying fields exactly agree in order for one to conclude that two records belong to the same individual, can be a valuable tool for improving data linkage. However, probabilistic matching is computationally complex and demanding, and not well understood by many who may wish to apply it in their work. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide an overview of one approach to probabilistic matching, including the step-by-step procedures involved in the calculation of indices corresponding to the likelihood that two records are a correct match. In addition, the use of multiple iterative protocols, in which several different matching strategies are used in order to maximize the number of linked records, is discussed. Finally, issues related to deduplication and verification of internal-consistency in the linked data set are also reviewed.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for >20 minutes has been considered futile after pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests. This concept has recently been questioned, although the effect of CPR duration on outcomes has not recently been described. Our objective was to determine the relationship between CPR duration and outcomes after pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the effect of CPR duration for pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests from the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation prospective, multicenter registry of in-hospital cardiac arrests. We included 3419 children from 328 U.S. and Canadian Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation sites with an in-hospital cardiac arrest between January 2000 and December 2009. Patients were stratified into 5 patient illness categories: surgical cardiac, medical cardiac, general medical, general surgical, and trauma. Survival to discharge was 27.9%, but only 19.0% of all cardiac arrest patients had favorable neurological outcomes. Between 1 and 15 minutes of CPR, survival decreased linearly by 2.1% per minute, and rates of favorable neurological outcome decreased by 1.2% per minute. Adjusted probability of survival was 41% for CPR duration of 1 to 15 minutes and 12% for >35 minutes. Among survivors, favorable neurological outcome occurred in 70% undergoing <15 minutes of CPR and 60% undergoing CPR >35 minutes. Compared with general medical patients, surgical cardiac patients had the highest adjusted odds ratios for survival and favorable neurological outcomes, 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.8-3.4) and 2.7 (95% confidence interval, 2.0-3.9), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CPR duration was independently associated with survival to hospital discharge and neurological outcome. Among survivors, neurological outcome was favorable for the majority of patients. Performing CPR for >20 minutes is not futile in some patient illness categories.},

  Abstract                 = {The decision to use bedside pulmonary artery catheterization for managing patients must involve a careful assessment of the risks compared to the benefits. Complications can be minimized by following specific guidelines for catheter insertion and maintenance. Pulmonary artery catheterization has been shown to be more accurate than clinical assessment alone in critically ill patients for determining the cause of shock (hypovolemic, cardiogenic, or septic) or for assessing the cause of severe pulmonary edema (cardiogenic or noncardiogenic). The diagnosis of cardiac failure in medical or surgical patients with invasive hemodynamic monitoring provides physiologic data that guide pharmacologic treatment that may favorably influence preload and afterload in the failing or ischemic heart. Managing hemodynamics with the aid of pulmonary artery catheterization in patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome has received considerable attention, but a contribution to better patient outcome has not been established. Similarly, although clinical management of hemodynamic instability in septic shock is facilitated by pulmonary artery catheterization, the mortality remains very high because of the lack of specific therapy to reverse the sepsis syndrome. Adequate volume resuscitation and improved tissue oxygenation are universally accepted goals, but specific hemodynamic endpoints are controversial and direct measurements of tissue oxygenation are not possible. Prospective studies to define the clinical value of pulmonary artery catheterization are needed, but must be designed very carefully in order to identify unequivocally the effect of pulmonary artery catheterization on outcome in critically ill patients.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Despite the overall high degree of response to pharmacotherapy, consensus is lacking on how to judge clinical response or define optimal treatment/remission when treating adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study examined clinical response and symptomatic remission in analyses of 2 studies of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) in adults with ADHD. METHODS: In a 4-week, double-blind, forced-dose trial, adults with ADHD were randomized to LDX 30, 50, and 70 mg/day (mg/d) or placebo. In a second, open-label, follow-up trial, adults entering from the 4-week study were titrated to an "optimal" LDX dose (30 mg/d [n=44], 50 mg/d [n=112], and 70 mg/d [n=171]) over 4 weeks, and maintained for 11 additional months. The ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) with adult prompts and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale assessed efficacy. Clinical response was defined, post hoc, as >/=30% reduction from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV and CGI-I rating of 1 or 2; symptomatic remission was defined as ADHD-RS-IV total score </=18. Log rank analysis examined overall significance among the treatment groups in time to response or remission. RESULTS: Four hundred and fourteen participants in the 4-week study and 345 in the open-label, extension study were included in the efficacy populations. All LDX groups improved by ADHD-RS-IV and CGI-I scores in both studies. In the 4-week study (n=414), 69.3% responded and 45.5% achieved remission with LDX (all doses); 37.1% responded and 16.1% achieved remission with placebo; time (95% CI) to median clinical response (all LDX doses) was 15.0 (15.0, 17.0) days and to remission was 31.0 (28.0, 37.0) days (P<.0001 overall). In the open-label study, with LDX (all doses), 313 (95.7%) and 278 (85.0%) of 327 participants with evaluable maintenance-phase data met criteria for response and remission, respectively. Of participants who completed dose optimization, 75.2% remained responders and 65.7% remained in remission in the 12-month study. Overall, 285 (82.6%) and 227 (65.8%) of 345 participants were responders and remitters, respectively, at their final visits. CONCLUSION: In the long-term study, with open-label, dose-optimized LDX treatment, most adults with ADHD achieved clinical response and/or symptomatic remission; almost two-thirds maintained symptomatic remission over the remaining 11 months.

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Accurate, context-specific regulation of gene expression is essential for all organisms. Accordingly, it is very important to understand the complex relations within cellular gene regulatory networks. A tool to describe and analyze the behavior of such networks are Boolean models. The reconstruction of a Boolean network from biological data requires identification of dependencies within the network. This task becomes increasingly computationally demanding with large amounts of data created by recent high-throughput technologies. Thus, we developed a method that is especially suited for network structure reconstruction from large-scale data. In our approach, we took advantage of the fact that a specific transcription factor often will consistently either activate or inhibit a specific target gene, and this kind of regulatory behavior can be modeled using monotone functions. RESULTS: To detect regulatory dependencies in a network, we examined how the expression of different genes correlates to successive network states. For this purpose, we used Pearson correlation as an elementary correlation measure. Given a Boolean network containing only monotone Boolean functions, we prove that the correlation of successive states can identify the dependencies in the network. This method not only finds dependencies in randomly created artificial networks to very high percentage, but also reconstructed large fractions of both a published Escherichia coli regulatory network from simulated data and a yeast cell cycle network from real microarray data.},

The data analyses are largely descriptive in character. Missing data points were described and not omitted in the analysis. Statistical analysis was not performed due to missing data points in some categories. Certain trends, however, could be identified and are discussed.

A report of ever and recent use was most common among women 25-34 (92% and 86.9%, respectively). Only 0.6% of recently screened women reported access problems. Among those without a recent test, most (53%) reported that they did not think it was necessary. Pap test use varied little across provinces and was less common among older and single women, those with lower education, a spoken language other than English, a birth place outside Canada and negative health and lifestyle characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {Earlier experiments have shown that cyclosporin A (CsA) and its non-calcineurin inhibitory analog NIM811 attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI). Presently, we compared the neuroprotective effects of previously determined mitochondrial protective doses of CsA (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and NIM811 (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) when administered at 15 mins postinjury in preventing cytoskeletal (alpha-spectrin) degradation, neurodegeneration, and neurological dysfunction after severe (1.0 mm) controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI in mice. In a first set of experiments, we analyzed calpain-mediated alpha-spectrin proteolysis at 24 h postinjury. Both NIM811 and CsA significantly attenuated the increased alpha-spectrin breakdown products observed in vehicle-treated animals (P<0.005). In a second set of experiments, treatment of animals with either NIM811 or CsA at 15 mins and again at 24 h postinjury attenuated motor function impairment at 48 h and 7 days (P<0.005) and neurodegeneration at 7 days postinjury (P<0.0001). Delayed administration of NIM811 out to 12 h was still able to significantly reduce alpha-spectrin degradation. These results show that the neuroprotective mechanism of CsA involves maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and that calcineurin inhibition plays little or no role because the non-calcineurin inhibitory analog, NIM811, is as effective as CsA.},

DESIGN: Retrospective, cohort study involving a 1-year postinjury interview. SETTING: Sixty-two acute care, nonfederal hospitals in South Carolina. PARTICIPANTS: Persons (> or =15y) hospitalized with TBI. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The psychosocial health scales of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. RESULTS: Of the 7612 participants, 29% reported poor psychosocial health. Factors associated with poor psychosocial well-being included younger age, female sex, Medicaid coverage, no health insurance, inadequate or moderate social support, comorbidities (eg, a preinjury substance abuse problem), cognitive complaints, and some or a lot of limitation with activities of daily living. Only 36% of participants who reported poor psychosocial health reported receiving any mental health services. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of persons hospitalized with TBI reported poor psychosocial health at 1 year postinjury. To optimize recovery, clinicians need to ensure that patients' psychosocial health needs are addressed during the postacute period.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Clinical trials in traumatic brain injury have a disappointing track record, with a long history of 'negative' Phase III trials. One contributor to this lack of success is almost certainly the low efficiency of the conventional approach to the analysis, which discards information by dichotomizing an ordinal outcome scale. PURPOSE: Our goal was to evaluate the potential efficiency gains, which can be achieved by using techniques, which extract additional information from ordinal outcome data - the proportional odds model and the sliding dichotomy. In addition, we evaluated the additional efficiency gains, which can be achieved through covariate adjustment. METHODS: The study was based on simulations, which were built around a database of patient-level data extracted from eight Phase III trials and three observational studies in traumatic brain injury. Two different putative treatment effects were explored, one which followed the proportional odds model, and the other which assumed that the effect of the intervention was to reduce the risk of death without changing the distribution of outcomes within survivors. The results are expressed as efficiency gains, reported as the percentage reduction in sample size that can be used with the ordinal analyses without loss of statistical power relative to the conventional binary analysis. RESULTS: The simulation results show substantial efficiency gains. Use of the sliding dichotomy allows sample sizes to be reduced by up to 40% without loss of statistical power. The proportional odds model gives modest additional gains over and above the gains achieved by use of the sliding dichotomy. LIMITATIONS: As with any simulation study, it is difficult to know how far the findings may be extrapolated beyond the actual situations that were modeled. CONCLUSIONS: Both ordinal techniques offer substantial efficiency gains relative to the conventional binary analysis. The choice between the two techniques involves subtle value judgments. In the situations examined, the proportional odds model gave efficiency gains over and above the sliding dichotomy, but arguably, the sliding dichotomy is more intuitive and clinically appealing.},

Readmissions within 60 days for SSI were identified based on the presence of ICD9 codes for (1) infectious complication of device or procedure, or (2) sepsis or specific bacterial infection with an accompanying reoperation. Logistic regression models accounting for patient-level risk factors for SSI were used to estimate expected (patient-level risk across all hospitals) and predicted (weighted average of hospital-specific and all-hospital estimates) outcomes. Relative performance was determined using the hospital-specific predicted versus expected (pe) ratios.Average volume across hospitals ranged from 2 to 23 fusions/quarter and was not associated with readmissions. Of the 7560 children in the cohort, 534 (7\%) were readmitted for reoperation and 451 (6\%) were readmitted for SSI within 60 days of discharge. Reoperations were associated with an SSI in 70\% of cases. Across hospitals, SSI and reoperation rates ranged from 1\% to 11\% and 1\% to 12\%, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, insurance, presence of a gastric tube, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, tracheostomy, prior admissions, number of chronic conditions, procedure type (anterior/posterior), and level (>9 or <9 vertebrae), pe ratios indicating hospital performance varied by 2-fold for each outcome.After standardizing outcomes using patient-level factors and relative case mix, several hospitals in this cohort were more successful at preventing readmissions for SSIs and reoperations. Closer examination of the organization and implementation of strategies for SSI prevention at high-performing centers may offer valuable clues for improving care at lower performing institutions.Level III.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between the volume of children admitted to the hospital with acute gastroenteritis and adherence to recommended quality indicators. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Premier Perspective clinical and financial information systems database (Premier Inc, Charlotte, North Carolina). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 12 604 otherwise healthy children aged 3 months to 10 years hospitalized between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2009, at 280 US hospitals with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes indicating acute gastroenteritis. Main Exposure Volume of hospital admissions per year of children with acute gastroenteritis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality indicators for overuse and misuse of care in the management of acute gastroenteritis based on nationally published guidelines. These include blood testing, stool studies, use of antibiotics, and use of nonrecommended antiemetic or antidiarrheal medications (hereafter referred to as nonrecommended medications). RESULTS: Selected blood, stool, and rotavirus tests (overuse indicators) were performed in 85%, 46%, and 56% of children, respectively. Six percent of children received nonrecommended medications, and 26% received antibiotics (misuse indicators). Higher volumes of hospital admission for acute gastroenteritis were associated with less use of blood tests (odds ratio [OR], 0.67 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.50-0.89]), nonrecommended medications (OR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76-0.93]), and antibiotics (OR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86-0.99]). Children admitted to hospitals in the 25th vs 75th percentile of patient volume had a 10%, 30%, and 10% increased chance of having blood tests, nonrecommended medications, and antibiotics ordered, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally representative sample of hospitals that care for children with acute gastroenteritis, higher patient volumes were associated with greater adherence to established quality indicators. Further investigation is needed to identify the hospital characteristics driving the volume-quality relationship for this common pediatric condition.},

  Abstract                 = {Removal of apoptotic cells from inflammatory sites is an important step in the resolution of inflammation. Both murine and human macrophages stimulated with TNF-alpha or directly administered arachidonic acid showed an impaired ability to ingest apoptotic cells (efferocytosis). The inhibition was shown to be due to generation of reactive oxygen species, was blocked with a superoxide dismutase mimetic, MnTBAP, and was mimicked by direct addition of H2O2. To determine the mechanism of TNF-alpha-stimulated oxidant production, bone marrow-derived macrophages from gp91(phox)-deficient mice were examined but shown to still produce oxidants and exhibit defective apoptotic cell uptake. In contrast, a specific cytosolic phospholipase A2 inhibitor blocked the oxidant production and reversed the inhibited uptake. The suppressive effect of endogenous or exogenous oxidants on efferocytosis was mediated through activation of the GTPase, Rho. It was reversed in macrophages pretreated with C3 transferase to inactivate Rho or with an inhibitor of Rho kinase. During maturation of human monocyte-derived macrophages, only mature cells exhibited TNF-alpha-induced suppression of apoptotic cell clearance. The resistance of immature macrophages to such inhibition was shown to result not from defective generation of oxidants, but rather, from lack of response of these cells to the oxidants. Overall, the data suggest that macrophages in a TNF-alpha- and oxidant-rich inflammatory environment are less able to remove apoptotic cells and, thereby, may contribute to the local intensity of the inflammatory response.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Age is an important determinant of outcome from adult cardiac arrests but has not been identified previously as an important factor in pediatric cardiac arrests except among premature infants. Chest compressions can result in more effective blood flow during cardiac arrest in an infant than an older child or adult because of increased chest wall compliance. We, therefore, hypothesized that survival from cardiac arrest would be better among infants than older children. METHODS: We evaluated 464 pediatric ICU arrests from the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation from 2000 to 2002. NICU cardiac arrests were excluded. Data from each arrest include >200 variables describing facility, patient, prearrest, arrest intervention, outcome, and quality improvement data. Age was categorized as newborn (<1 month; N = 62), infant (1 month to <1 year; N = 105), younger child (1 year to <8 years; N = 90), and older child (8 years to <21 years; N = 207). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the association between age and survival. RESULTS: Overall survival was 22%, with 27% of newborns, 36% of infants, 19% of younger children and 16% of older children surviving to hospital discharge. Newborns and infants demonstrated double and triple the odds of surviving to hospital discharge from a cardiac arrest in an intensive care setting when compared with older children. When potential confounders were controlled, newborns increased their advantage to almost fivefold, while infants maintained their survival advantage to older children. CONCLUSIONS: Survival from pediatric ICU cardiac arrest is age dependent. Newborns and infants have better survival rates even after adjusting for potential confounding variables.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Scant information exists on the effects of legislation mandating coverage of minimum postnatal hospital stays on infant health outcomes. There are also gaps in knowledge regarding the effectiveness of early follow-up visits for newborns. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of 1) legislation mandating coverage of minimum postnatal hospital stays and 2) early follow-up visits by the age of 4 days on infant outcomes during the first month of life. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of Ohio Medicaid claims data linked with birth certificate data for the period 1991-1998. The impact of the legislation was evaluated using interrupted time-series analysis of health-related utilization. The effects of early follow-up visits for vaginally delivered newborns with short stays were analyzed using the day of the week on which the birth occurred (eg, Monday, Tuesday) as an instrumental variable to account for potential confounding. A total of 155,352 full-term newborns who were born to mothers who receive Medicaid were studied. The main outcomes measured were rehospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, and diagnoses of dehydration and infection within 10 and 21 days of birth. RESULTS: Few outcomes exhibited significant changes after legislation mandating coverage of minimum postnatal hospital stays. Rates of rehospitalization for jaundice within 10 days of birth fell from 0.78% to 0.47% in the year after legislation was introduced but leveled off after the legislation took effect. Rates of ED visits within 21 days increased from 6.0% to 10.4% during periods of increasing short stay but fell to 8.0% during the year after introduction of the legislation and leveled off when the legislation took effect. Rates of all-cause rehospitalization, dehydration, and infection diagnoses showed no consistent relationship to Ohio's legislation. Using instrumental variable analysis, newborns who received early follow-up visits were significantly less likely to have rehospitalizations within the first 10 days of life than those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: In this state Medicaid population, legislation mandating coverage of minimum postnatal hospital stays was associated with reductions in the rates of rehospitalization for jaundice and ED visits. For newborns with short stays, early follow-up visits may reduce rehospitalizations in the early postpartum period.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Many childhood deaths in the United States occur in intensive care settings. The environmental needs of parents experiencing their child's death in a pediatric intensive care unit must be understood to design facilities that comfort at the time of death and promote healing after loss. The purpose of this study is to explore parents' environmental needs during their child's hospitalization and death in the pediatric intensive care unit. DESIGN: Descriptive qualitative study. SETTING: A university-affiliated children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three parents of 26 children who died in a pediatric intensive care unit. INTERVENTIONS: Semistructured, in-depth, videotaped interviews were conducted with parents 2 yrs after their child's death. Interviews were analyzed by an interdisciplinary research team using established qualitative methods. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Environmental themes identified through parent interviews included 1) places remembered, 2) spatial characteristics, 3) services for daily living, 4) parent caregiving, 5) access, and 6) presence of people. Places remembered by parents in most detail included the pediatric intensive care unit patient rooms and waiting room. Spatial characteristics pertaining to these places included the need for privacy, proximity, adequate space, control of sensory stimuli, cleanliness, and safety. Parents needed facilities that enabled self-care such as a place to eat, shower, and sleep. Parents also needed access to their child and opportunities to participate in their child's care. Parents described the physical presence of people, such as those who provide professional and personal support, as another important environmental need. CONCLUSIONS: The pediatric intensive care unit environment affects parents at the time of their child's death and produces memories that are vivid and long lasting. Positive environmental memories can contribute to comfort during bereavement whereas negative memories can compound an already devastating experience. Parents' perspectives of the pediatric intensive care unit environment can provide insight for adapting existing spaces and designing new facilities.},

Although challenges to successful implementation exist, the growing body of evidence suggests that PFCC is beneficial to patients, families, and staff.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: 1) To describe clinical characteristics, hospital courses, and outcomes of a cohort of children cared for within the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest with sustained return of circulation between July 1, 2003 and December 31, 2004, and 2) to identify factors associated with hospital mortality in this population. These data are required to prepare a randomized trial of therapeutic hypothermia on neurobehavioral outcomes in children after in-hospital cardiac arrest. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Fifteen children's hospitals associated with Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network. PATIENTS: Patients between 1 day and 18 years of age who had cardiopulmonary resuscitation and received chest compressions for >1 min, and had a return of circulation for >20 mins. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 353 patients met entry criteria; 172 (48.7%) survived to hospital discharge. Among survivors, 132 (76.7%) had good neurologic outcome documented by Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scores. After adjustment for age, gender, and first documented cardiac arrest rhythm, variables available before and during the arrest that were independently associated with increased mortality included pre-existing hematologic, oncologic, or immunologic disorders, genetic or metabolic disorders, presence of an endotracheal tube before the arrest, and use of sodium bicarbonate during the arrest. Variables associated with decreased mortality included postoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Extending the time frame to include variables available before, during, and within 12 hours following arrest, variables independently associated with increased mortality included the use of calcium during the arrest. Variables associated with decreased mortality included higher minimum blood pH and pupillary responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Many factors are associated with hospital mortality among children after in-hospital cardiac arrest and return of circulation. Such factors must be considered when designing a trial of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest in pediatric patients.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the reliability and validity of the Bereaved Parent Needs Assessment, a new instrument to measure parents' needs and need fulfillment around the time of their child's death in the pediatric intensive care unit. We hypothesized that need fulfillment would be negatively related to complicated grief and positively related to quality of life during bereavement. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Five U.S. children's hospital pediatric intensive care units. SUBJECTS: Parents (n = 121) bereaved in a pediatric intensive care unit 6 months earlier. INTERVENTIONS: Surveys included the 68-item Bereaved Parent Needs Assessment, the Inventory of Complicated Grief, and the abbreviated version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire. Each Bereaved Parent Needs Assessment item described a potential need and was rated on two scales: 1) a 5-point rating of importance (1 = not at all important, 5 = very important) and 2) a 5-point rating of fulfillment (1 = not at all met, 5 = completely met). Three composite scales were computed: 1) total importance (percentage of all needs rated >/=4 for importance), 2) total fulfillment (percentage of all needs rated >/=4 for fulfillment), and 3) percent fulfillment (percentage of important needs that were fulfilled). Internal consistency reliability was assessed by Cronbach's alpha and Spearman-Brown-corrected split-half reliability. Generalized estimating equations were used to test predictions between composite scales and the Inventory of Complicated Grief and World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two items had mean importance ratings <3, and 55 had mean ratings >4. Reliability of composite scores ranged from 0.92 to 0.94. Total fulfillment was negatively correlated with Inventory of Complicated Grief (r = -.29; p < .01) and positively correlated with World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire (r = .21; p < .05). Percent fulfillment was also significantly correlated with both outcomes. Adjusting for parent's age, education, and loss of an only child, percent fulfillment remained significantly correlated with Inventory of Complicated Grief but not with World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: The Bereaved Parent Needs Assessment demonstrated reliability and validity to assess the needs of parents bereaved in the pediatric intensive care unit. Meeting parents' needs around the time of their child's death may promote adjustment to loss.},

  Abstract                 = {A clear, concise definition of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is fundamental for reporting, comparison, and interpretation of studies on TBI. Changing epidemiologic patterns, an increasing recognition of significance of mild TBI, and a better understanding of the subtler neurocognitive neuroaffective deficits that may result from these injuries make this need even more critical. The Demographics and Clinical Assessment Working Group of the International and Interagency Initiative toward Common Data Elements for Research on Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health has therefore formed an expert group that proposes the following definition: In this article, we discuss criteria for considering or establishing a diagnosis of TBI, with a particular focus on the problems how a diagnosis of TBI can be made when patients present late after injury and how mild TBI may be differentiated from non-TBI causes with similar symptoms. Technologic advances in magnetic resonance imaging and the development of biomarkers offer potential for improving diagnostic accuracy in these situations.},

  Abstract                 = {Seventy-five children, 16 years of age or younger, consecutively admitted to a level I trauma center over a 2-year period with severe nonpenetrating traumatic brain injuries were studied to assess factors predictive of survival and level of disability. The mortality rate was 33%; 31% had good recovery, 12% had moderate disability, 19% had severe disability, and 5% remained in a vegetative state. Factors were analyzed separately for potential effects on survival and, with fatalities excluded, for potential effects on the level of disability in survivors. Clinical status in the field and emergency room, although highly associated with survival, was less predictive of the level of disability in survivors. Glasgow Coma Scale scores 72 hours after injury, especially the motor component, were significantly better predictors of quality of survival. The severity of the brain injury and the presence and severity of extracranial injuries were strongly related both to survival and quality of survival. Chest injuries, in particular, were associated with increased mortality and morbidity, as was level of oxygenation; these factors were highly correlated. Factors most significantly predictive of survival were severity of total injuries as assessed with the Injury Severity Score and pupillary responses in the emergency room; factors most predictive of disability were Glasgow Coma Scale motor responses 72 hours after injury and level of oxygenation in the emergency room. These findings of differential predictive factors for outcomes of survival versus quality of survival have implications relevant both to clinical care and to research involving severely brain-injured children.},

  Abstract                 = {AIM: This study analyzed hemodynamic recordings collected on a beat-to-beat basis during orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The first aim was to construct a graphic that will represent hemodynamic profile during OLT. The second aim was to compare the intraoperative hemodynamic pattern of survivors versus nonsurvivors and those who received a liver from normal versus marginal donors. METHODS: Hemodynamic data (including cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume [SV] and SV index, systemic vascular resistance [SVR] and SVR index, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate) were collected from 100 consecutive adult OLT patients with the use of a lithium dilution cardiac output (LiDCO plus) monitor. A LOESS (Robust Locally Weighted Regression and Smoothing Scatterplots) smoother was used to give a more easily interpreted graph. Patients were grouped with respect to survival at 30 days (survivors vs nonsurvivors) and quality of graft (marginal vs normal). RESULTS: We constructed graphics that represented all intraopetative hemodynamic data during OLT for 100 consecutive procedures. It confirmed hyperdynamic circulation during OLT. Statistical analysis did not reveal significant differences regarding intraoperative hemodynamic data between survivors and nonsurvivors, or between patients receiving normal versus marginal grafts. CONCLUSION: This study shows changes in the hemodynamic profile during OLT, measured on a beat-to-beat basis. Intraoperative hemodynamic changes did not predict patients who did not survive OLT. Beat-to-beat monitoring did not reveal significant hemodynamic instability following transplantation of marginal grafts.},

  Abstract                 = {Human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) are the dominant phase II conjugative drug metabolism enzymes that also play a central role in processing a range of endobiotic compounds. UGTs catalyze the covalent addition of glucuronic acid sugar moieties to a host of therapeutics and environmental toxins, as well as to a variety of endogenous steroids and other signaling molecules. We report the 1.8-A resolution apo crystal structure of the UDP-glucuronic acid binding domain of human UGT isoform 2B7 (UGT2B7), which catalyzes the conjugative elimination of opioid, antiviral, and anticancer drugs. This is the first crystal structure of any region of a mammalian UGT drug metabolism enzyme. Designated UGT2B7 mutants at residues predicted to interact with the UDP-glucuronic acid cofactor exhibited significantly impaired catalytic activity, with maximum effects observed for amino acids closest to the glucuronic acid sugar transferred to the acceptor molecule. Homology modeling of UGT2B7 with related plant flavonoid glucosyltransferases indicates human UGTs share a common catalytic mechanism. Point mutations at predicted catalytic residues in UGT2B7 abrogated activity, strongly suggesting human UGTs also utilize a serine hydrolase-like catalytic mechanism to facilitate glucuronic acid transfer.},

  Abstract                 = {This study quantifies the shape change in elephant manus and pes anatomy with increasing body mass, using computed tomographic scanning. Most manus and pes bones, and manus tendons, maintain their shape, or become more gracile, through ontogeny. Contrary to this, tendons of the pes become significantly more robust, suggesting functional adaptation to increasingly high loads. Ankle tendon cross-sectional area (CSA) scales the highest in the long digital extensor, proportional to body mass(1.08+/-0.21), significantly greater than the highest-scaling wrist tendon (extensor carpi ulnaris, body mass(0.69+/-0.09)). These patterns of shape change relate to the marked anatomical differences between the pillar-like manus and tripod-like pes, consistent with differences in fore- and hindlimb locomotor function. The cartilaginous predigits (prepollux and prehallux) of the manus and pes also become relatively more robust through ontogeny, and their pattern of shape change does not resemble that seen in any of the 10 metacarpals and metatarsals. Their CSAs scale above isometry proportional to body mass(0.73+/-0.09) and body mass(0.82+/-0.07) respectively. We infer a supportive function for these structures, preventing collapse of the foot pad during locomotion.},

  Abstract                 = {Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is common after head injury and strongly associated with mortality and morbidity. Empirical and prophylactic therapy with steroids and barbiturates has proved unsuccessful. Ideally, therapy should be targeted at the predominant cause of the increase in ICP. In head injury these may be (1) an increase in cerebral blood volume best treated by hyperventilation and hypnotic drugs. (2) an increase in brain water content best treated by osmotherapy and (3) increased CSF outflow resistance best treated by CSF drainage. This last cause seldom predominates in head injury. To determine whether it is possible to identify the best therapy in individual head injured patients, we are comparing osmotherapy (mannitol) and hypnotic drugs (thiopentone and gamma-hydroxybutyrate) in selected patients with severe head injury where it is possible to maintain standard conditions of ventilation and stable blood pressure and to measure ICP, CPP, brain electrical activity, PR ratio of the ICP wave form and cerebral AvDO2 before and during each of the two forms of therapy. Effective therapy means that ICP has been reduced to 20 mm Hg with preservation or improvement in CPP. 17 patients have been studied so far and 4 groups identified. Osmotherapy was superior to hypnotic in 5 cases, hypnotic superior to mannitol in 3 cases, both were effective in 5 cases and neither effective in 4 cases. Patients in whom hypnotics were superior tended to be younger, with diffuse rather than focal brain injury, had the highest levels of brain electrical activity prior to treatment and a higher PR ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Despite strong medical evidence and policy initiatives supporting the use of daily interruption of sedation in mechanically ventilated patients, compliance remains suboptimal. We sought to identify new barriers to daily interruption of sedation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted 5 focus groups of intensive care unit physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists during a 2-month period to identify attitudes, barriers, and motivations to perform a daily interruption of sedation. Each focus group was audiotaped, and the transcripts were analyzed using qualitative methods to identify recurrent themes. RESULTS: There was wide consensus on the importance of daily interruptions of sedation; however, practitioners usually performed sedation interruption for 1 of 5 distinct reasons: minimizing the dose of sedation, performing a neurologic examination, facilitating ventilator weaning, reducing intensive care unit length of stay, and assessing patient pain. Participants rarely espoused more than 1 main reason, and there was no shared understanding of why one might do a daily interruption of sedation. This lack of shared understanding led to different patients being selected and diverse approaches to carrying out the DIS. CONCLUSIONS: Despite apparent consensus, lack of shared understanding of the rationale for an intervention may lead to divergent practice patterns and failure to implement standardized, evidence-based practice.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Daily interruption of sedation (DIS) has multiple proven benefits, but implementation is erratic. Past research on sedative interruption utilisation focused on individual clinicians, ignoring the role of organisations in shaping practice. The authors test the hypothesis that specific hospital organisational characteristics are associated with routine use of DIS. DESIGN AND SETTING: National, mailed survey to a stratified random sample of US hospitals in 2009. Respondents were the lead infection control professionals at each institution. METHODS: Survey items enquired about DIS use, institutional structure, and organisational culture. Multivariable analysis was used to evaluate the independent association of these factors with DIS use. RESULTS: A total of 386 hospitals formed our final analytic sample; the response rate was 69.4%. Hospitals ranged in size from 25 to 1359 beds. 26% of hospitals were associated with a medical school. Almost 80% reported regular use of DIS for ventilated patients. While 75.4% of hospitals reported having leadership focus on safety culture, only 42.7% reported that their staff were receptive to changes in practice. In a multivariable logistic regression model, structural characteristics such as size and academic affiliation were not associated with use of DIS. However, leadership emphasis on safety culture (p=0.04), staff receptivity to change (p=0.02) and involvement in an infection prevention collaborative (p=0.04) were significantly associated with regular DIS use. CONCLUSIONS: Several elements of hospital organisational culture were associated with regular use of DIS in US hospitals. These findings emphasise the importance of combining specific administrative approaches with strategies to encourage receptivity to change among bedside clinicians in order to successfully implement complex evidence-based practices in the intensive care setting.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective: ICD-9-CM codes are often used for trauma research due to their ready availability in administrative databases. They are also used to classify injury severity in trauma patients. However, errors in coding may limit the use of these codes. Prior studies have found coding accuracy ranging from 20 to 100%, casting doubt on the reliability of studies utilizing these codes. The goal of this study was to determine the accuracy of ICD-9-CM coding for cervical spine fractures. Methods: We used ICD-9-CM codes to identify trauma admissions and cervical spine fractures at a Level I trauma center in 2006. Cervical spine CT or CTA reports were reviewed by two independent observers. Data were compared to ICD-9-CM codes to determine accuracy. Results: Of 1620 trauma admissions, 174 (11%) included a cervical spine fracture defined by ICD-9-CM codes. A cervical spine fracture was the primary diagnosis in 79 admissions and a secondary diagnosis in 63 admissions. Of the 142 cervical spine fractures defined by ICD-9-CM code, there were 133 (94%) cervical fractures by radiology report. Accuracy varied by primary diagnosis (97%) versus secondary diagnosis (89%). By cervical level, there were 230 fractures by CT report. Of these, 7% of ICD-9-CM codes documented a fractured level not noted in the CT report. Conversely, 14% of fractured levels noted by CT report did not have a corresponding ICD-9-CM code. Implications: We found an overall 94% accuracy of ICD-9-CM coding compared to radiology reports. Inaccuracy of coding fracture level ranged from 7 to 14%. Researchers using these codes should refer back to the medical record or perform a sensitivity analysis to improve reliability.

  Abstract                 = {Understanding how individual cells behave inside living systems will help enable new diagnostic tools and cellular therapies. Superparamagnetic iron oxide particles can be used to label cells and theranostic capsules for noninvasive tracking using MRI. Contrast changes from superparamagnetic iron oxide are often subtle relative to intrinsic sources of contrast, presenting a detection challenge. Here, we describe a versatile postprocessing method, called Phase map cross-correlation Detection and Quantification (PDQ), that automatically identifies localized deposits of superparamagnetic iron oxide, estimating their volume magnetic susceptibility and magnetic moment. To demonstrate applicability, PDQ was used to detect and characterize superparamagnetic iron oxide-labeled magnetocapsules implanted in porcine liver and suspended in agarose gel. PDQ was also applied to mouse brains infiltrated by MPIO-labeled macrophages following traumatic brain injury; longitudinal, in vivo studies tracked individual MPIO clusters over 3 days, and tracked clusters were corroborated in ex vivo brain scans. Additionally, we applied PDQ to rat hearts infiltrated by MPIO-labeled macrophages in a transplant model of organ rejection. PDQ magnetic measurements were signal-to-noise ratio invariant for images with signal-to-noise ratio > 11. PDQ can be used with conventional gradient-echo pulse sequences, requiring no extra scan time. The method is useful for visualizing biodistribution of cells and theranostic magnetocapsules and for measuring their relative iron content.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: This report presents final 2004 data on U.S. deaths; death rates; life expectancy; infant and maternal mortality; and trends by selected characteristics such as age, sex, Hispanic origin, race, marital status, educational attainment, injury at work, state of residence, and cause of death. Previous reports presented preliminary mortality data for 2004 and summarized key findings in the final data for 2004. METHODS: This report presents descriptive tabulations of information reported on death certificates, which are completed by funeral directors, attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. The original records are filed in the state registration offices. Statistical information is compiled into a national database through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Causes of death are processed in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). RESULTS: In 2004, a total of 2,397,615 deaths were reported in the United States. The age-adjusted death rate was 800.8 deaths per 100,000 standard population, representing a decrease of 3.8 percent from the 2003 rate and a record low historical figure. Life expectancy at birth rose by 0.4 year to a record high of 77.8 years. Age-specific death rates decreased for all age groups. (The decrease for children aged 5-14 years was not statistically significant.) The 15 leading causes of death in 2004 remained the same as in 2003. Heart disease and cancer continued to be the leading and second leading causes of death, together accounting for over one-half of all deaths. In 2004, Alzheimer's disease surpassed and swapped positions with Influenza, relative to their previous placements in 2003. The infant mortality rate in 2004 was 6.79 per 1000 births. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, mortality patterns in 2004 were consistent with long-term trends. Life expectancy in 2004 increased again to a new record level. The age-adjusted death rate declined to a record low historical figure. Although not statistically significant, the decrease in the infant mortality rate is typical of recent trends; except for 2002, the infant mortality rate has either decreased or remained level each successive year from 1958 to 2004.},

  Abstract                 = {Survival analysis has been a topic of active statistical research in the past few decades with applications spread across several areas. Traditional applications usually consider data with only a small numbers of predictors with a few hundreds or thousands of observations. Recent advances in data acquisition techniques and computation power have led to considerable interest in analyzing very-high-dimensional data where the number of predictor variables and the number of observations range between 10 4 and 10 6 . In this paper, we present a tool for performing large-scale regularized parametric survival analysis using a variant of the cyclic coordinate descent method. Through our experiments on two real data sets, we show that application of regularized models to high-dimensional data avoids overfitting and can provide improved predictive performance and calibration over corresponding low-dimensional models.

  Abstract                 = {Warfarin therapy in pediatric patients can be difficult to manage with bleeding as a primary adverse event. Therapy initiation can be difficult as doses to achieve therapeutic outcomes are being determined. Evaluation of readmission for bleeding in pediatric patients discharged on warfarin therapy may be useful to prevent adverse events.The Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) was queried to identify all patients <19 years of age who were discharged from a pediatric hospital on warfarin therapy. Patients who were readmitted with bleeding in the first 30 days after discharge were identified and patient variables, hospital stay variables, and medications at discharge were identified. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for bleeding readmission.A total of 4,883 patients met study criteria (56\% male, mean age 10.1 + 5.9 years). The two most common indications for warfarin therapy were cardiac valve replacement (23.6\%) and Fontan procedure (19.5\%). Ninety-seven patients (1.99\%) were readmitted with bleeding within 30 days of discharge [median time 9 days (IQR 5-16 days)]. Multivariate analysis identified Asian race (OR 4.0, P < 0.01); mitral valve replacement (OR 2.5, P < 0.01); escitalopram at discharge (OR 4.2, P = 0.02); levofloxacin at discharge (OR 8.3, P < 0.01); lansoprazole at discharge (OR 1.7, P = 0.047); and length of stay (OR 1.01, P = 0.047) as significant for bleeding readmission.Pediatric patients discharged on warfarin may be readmitted for bleeding within 30 days if risk factors are present. Risk factors include patient genetic profile, drug interactions, and indications with higher goal INR values.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To describe a large cohort of children with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of circulation and to identify factors in the early postarrest period associated with survival. These objectives were for planning an interventional trial of therapeutic hypothermia after pediatric cardiac arrest. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at 15 Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network clinical sites over an 18-month study period. All children from 1 day (24 hrs) to 18 yrs of age with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and a history of at least 1 min of chest compressions with return of circulation for at least 20 mins were eligible. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight cases met study entry criteria; the overall mortality was 62% (85 of 138 cases). The event characteristics associated with increased survival were as follows: weekend arrests, cardiopulmonary resuscitation not ongoing at hospital arrival, arrest rhythm not asystole, no atropine or NaHCO3, fewer epinephrine doses, shorter duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and drowning or asphyxial arrest event. For the 0- to 12-hr postarrest return-of-circulation period, absence of any vasopressor or inotropic agent (dopamine, epinephrine) use, higher lowest temperature recorded, greater lowest pH, lower lactate, lower maximum glucose, and normal pupillary responses were all associated with survival. A multivariate logistic model of variables available at the time of arrest, which controlled for gender, age, race, and asystole or ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia anytime during the arrest, found the administration of atropine and epinephrine to be associated with mortality. A second model using additional information available up to 12 hrs after return of circulation found 1) preexisting lung or airway disease; 2) an etiology of arrest drowning or asphyxia; 3) higher pH, and 4) bilateral reactive pupils to be associated with lower mortality. Receiving more than three doses of epinephrine was associated with poor outcome in 96% (44 of 46) of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors were identified as associated with survival after out-of-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest with the return of circulation. Additional information available within a few hours after the return of circulation may diminish outcome associations of factors available at earlier times in regression models. These factors should be considered in the design of future interventional trials aimed to improve outcome after pediatric cardiac arrest.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: : To describe a large multicenter cohort of pediatric cardiac arrest (CA) with return of circulation (ROC) from either the in-hospital (IH) or the out-of-hospital (OH) setting and to determine whether significant differences related to pre-event, arrest event, early postarrest event characteristics, and outcomes exist that would be critical in planning a clinical trial of therapeutic hypothermia (TH). DESIGN: : Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: : Fifteen Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network sites. PATIENTS: : Patients aged 24 hours to 18 years with either IH or OH CA who had a history of at least 1 minute of chest compressions and ROC for at least 20 minutes were eligible. INTERVENTIONS: : None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: : A total of 491 patients met study entry criteria with 353 IH cases and 138 OH cases. Major differences between the IH and OH cohorts were observed for patient prearrest characteristics, arrest event initial rhythm described, and arrest medication use. Several postarrest interventions were used differently, however, the use of TH was similar (<5%) in both cohorts. During the 0-12-hour interval following ROC, OH cases had lower minimum temperature and pH, and higher maximum serum glucose recorded. Mortality was greater in the OH cohort (62% vs. 51%, p = 0.04) with the cause attributed to a neurologic indication much more frequent in the OH than in the IH cohort (69% vs. 20%; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: : For pediatric CA with ROC, several major differences exist between IH and OH cohorts. The finding that the etiology of death was attributed to neurologic indications much more frequently in OH arrests has important implications for future research. Investigators planning to evaluate the efficacy of new interventions, such as TH, should be aware that the IH and OH populations differ greatly and require independent clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: To examine associations between lifestyle risk factors and intrahepatic stone (IHS), we conducted a case-control study in Taiwan, which has the highest incidence of IHS in the world. METHODS: Study subjects were 151 patients newly diagnosed with IHS at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between January 1999 and December 2001. Two control subjects per case were selected randomly from patients who underwent minor surgery at the same hospital and from family members or neighbors of the hospital staff. Controls were matched to each case by age and gender. Information on lifestyle factors was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Strength of associations was assessed using odds ratios derived from conditional logistic models. RESULTS: Female patients were significantly shorter than female controls. Compared to subjects with two or fewer children, odds ratios for those with six or more children were 20.4 in men (95% confidence interval, 1.89-221) and 2.82 (0.97-8.22) in women. Increasing level of education lowered the risk of intrahepatic stone (trend P = 0.004 for men and < 0.0001 for women). Women who had consumed ground-surface water for a long period had a somewhat increased risk (trend P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Lower socioeconomic status and poor hygiene may be involved in the development of intrahepatic stones.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: In adults, adjuvant corticosteroids significantly reduce mortality associated with bacterial meningitis; however, in children, studies reveal conflicting results. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between adjuvant corticosteroids and clinical outcomes in children with bacterial meningitis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A retrospective cohort study conducted between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2006, of 2780 children discharged with bacterial meningitis as their primary diagnosis from 27 tertiary care children's hospitals located in 18 US states and the District of Columbia that provide data to the Pediatric Health Information System's administrative database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Propensity scores, constructed using patient demographics and markers of illness severity at presentation, were used to determine each child's likelihood of receiving adjuvant corticosteroids. Primary outcomes of interest, time to death and time to hospital discharge, were analyzed by using propensity-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models stratified by age categories. RESULTS: The median age was 9 months (interquartile range, 0-6 years); 57% of the patients were males. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most commonly identified cause of meningitis. Adjuvant corticosteroids were administered to 248 children (8.9%). The overall mortality rate was 4.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5%-5.0%), and cumulative incidences were 2.2% and 3.1% at 7 days and 28 days, respectively, after admission. Adjuvant corticosteroids did not reduce mortality, regardless of age (children <1 year: hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.53-2.24; 1-5 years: HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.59-2.78; and >5 years: HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.38-2.25). Adjuvant corticosteroids were also not associated with time to hospital discharge. In subgroup analyses, the results did not change in either children identified with pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis or children with a cerebrospinal fluid culture performed at the admitting hospital. CONCLUSION: In this multicenter observational study of children with bacterial meningitis, adjuvant corticosteroid therapy was not associated with time to death or time to hospital discharge.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) is plagued by the problem of missing physiological data. The Glasgow Coma Scale score, Respiratory Rate and Systolic Blood Pressure are an essential part of risk adjustment strategies for trauma system evaluation and clinical research. Missing data on these variables may compromise the feasibility and the validity of trauma group comparisons. AIMS: To evaluate the validity of Multiple Imputation (MI) for completing missing physiological data in the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), by assessing the impact of MI on 1) frequency distributions, 2) associations with mortality, and 3) risk adjustment. METHODS: Analyses were based on 170,956 NTDB observations with complete physiological data (observed data set). Missing physiological data were artificially imposed on this data set and then imputed using MI (MI data set). To assess the impact of MI on risk adjustment, 100 pairs of hospitals were randomly selected with replacement and compared using adjusted Odds Ratios (OR) of mortality. OR generated by the observed data set were then compared to those generated by the MI data set. RESULTS: Frequency distributions and associations with mortality were preserved following MI. The median absolute difference between adjusted OR of mortality generated by the observed data set and by the MI data set was 3.6% (inter-quartile range: 2.4%-6.1%). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that, provided it is implemented with care, MI of missing physiological data in the NTDB leads to valid frequency distributions, preserves associations with mortality, and does not compromise risk adjustment in inter-hospital comparisons of mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Like most trauma registries, the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) is limited by the problem of missing physiologic data. Multiple imputation (MI) has been proposed to simulate missing Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, respiratory rate (RR), and systolic blood pressure (SBP). The aim of this study was to develop an MI model for missing physiologic data in the NTDB and to provide guidelines for its implementation. STUDY DESIGN: The NTDB 7.0 was restricted to patients admitted in 2005 with at least one anatomic injury code. A series of auxiliary variables thought to offer information for the imputation process was selected from the NTDB by literature review and expert opinion. The relation of these variables to physiologic variables and to the fact that they were missing was examined using logistic regression. The MI model included all auxiliary variables that had a statistically significant association with physiologic variables or with the fact that they were missing (Bonferroni-corrected p value <0.05). RESULTS: The NTDB sample included 373,243 observations. Glasgow Coma Scale, respiratory rate, and systolic blood pressure were missing for 20.3%, 3.9%, and 8.5% of data observations, respectively. The MI model included information on the following: gender, age, anatomic injury severity, transfer status, injury mechanism, intubation status, alcohol and drug test results, emergency department disposition, total length of stay, ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and discharge disposition. The MI model offered good discrimination for predicting the value of physiologic variables and the fact that they were missing (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.832 and 0.999). CONCLUSIONS: This article proposes an MI model for imputing missing physiologic data in the NTDB and provides guidelines to facilitate its use. Implementation of the model should improve the quality of research involving the NTDB. The methodology can also be adapted to other trauma registries.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: To investigate whether multiple imputation (MI) of missing Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) values generates more accurate GCS frequency distributions and less biased parameter estimates in logistic regression models predicting mortality than the standard procedure of excluding observations with missing GCS values. METHODS: The study population consisted of 5,065 patients with complete GCS information from the trauma registry of a Level 1 trauma center. Missing GCS values were imposed on the data set, and the performance of MI (extrapolating missing GCS from a data prediction model) and of deleting all data observations with missing GCS (list-wise deletion) were evaluated. GCS and Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) frequency distributions and parameter estimates were compared with true values from the original data set. RESULTS: GCS and TRISS frequency values generated by MI were much more accurate than those generated by list-wise deletion. GCS and TRISS parameter estimates generated by MI all had acceptable bias and coverage rates when compared with true values. List-wise deletion provided biased parameter estimates for the GCS, the Revised Trauma Score, and the Injury Severity Score. CONCLUSION: MI is a valid solution to the problem of missing GCS data in trauma research. It allows the conservation of precious data observations and leads to unbiased estimates in consequent analyses. Analyses, which exclude observations with missing GCS data, provide biased results.},

Trauma registry data were linked to hospital discharge data to obtain information on readmission up to 12 months postdischarge. Provincial admission rates were matched to study data by age and gender to obtain expected rates. Determinants of readmission were identified using multiple logistic regression.Cumulative readmission rates at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months were 5.9\%, 10.9\%, 15.5\%, and 21.1\%, respectively. Observed rates persisted above expected rates up to 11 months postdischarge. Thirty percent of 30-day readmissions were due to potential complications of injury compared with 3\% for general provincial admissions. Only 23\% of readmissions were to the same hospital. The strongest independent predictors of readmission were the number of prior admissions, discharge destination, the number of comorbidities, and age.Unplanned readmissions after discharge from acute care for traumatic injury are frequent, persist beyond 30 days, and are often related to potential complications of injury. Several patient-, injury-, and hospital-related factors are associated with the risk of readmission. Injury readmission rates should be monitored as part of trauma quality assurance efforts.},

To evaluate current practice against recently published guidelines.Prospective data collection of clinical and demographic information from paediatric and adult intensive care units in the UK and Ireland admitting children (< 16 years) with TBI between February 2001 and August 2003.Detailed clinical information was obtained for 501 children, with information on the use of ICP monitoring available in 445. ICP monitoring was used in only 59\% (75/127) of children presenting with an emergency room Glasgow Coma Scale of 8 or below. Large between centre variation was seen in the use of ICP monitoring, independent of severity of injury. There were 86 children who received ICP-targetted therapies without ICP monitoring. Wide between centre variation was found in the use of ICP-targetted therapies and in general aspects of management, such as fluid restriction, the use of muscle relaxants and prophylactic anticonvulsants. Intra-ventricular catheters are rarely placed (6\% of cases); therefore cerebrospinal fluid drainage is seldom used as a first-line therapy for raised ICP. Jugular venous bulb oximetry (4\%), brain microdialysis (< 1\%) and brain tissue oxygen monitoring (< 1\%) are rarely used in current practice. Contrary to published guidelines, moderate to severe hyperventilation is being used without monitoring for cerebral ischaemia.There is an urgent need for greater standardisation of practice across UK centres admitting children with severe TBI.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Measuring outcome in pediatric intensive care is necessary to equate the high cost of treatment with benefits to the patient. Although mortality rates and morbidity are relatively insensitive measures of the benefits of treatment, quality of life measurement gives insight into the long-term outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term quality of life outcome of children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit. DESIGN: Prospective survey. SETTING: A 13-bed pediatric intensive care unit in a university-affiliated, tertiary referral children's hospital. PATIENTS: Patients were 432 children discharged from the pediatric intensive care unit between May 1992 and April 1994. INTERVENTIONS: Quality of life was measured by using the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children Measure of Function. The scale has two components, the first part completed by the clinician after parent interview and the second part completed separately by the parent. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Parents of 432 children were contacted between 3 and 24 months after discharge. Twenty-seven children (6.3%) had died after discharge from the pediatric intensive care unit; 59.3% (256) had scores indicating a normal quality of life, and 32.4% (140) had a fair quality of life with ongoing health, social, or cognitive problems requiring some intervention. Two percent of survivors (nine children) had scores indicating a poor quality of life as they had continued to experience significant or disabling health problems requiring hospitalization or the equivalent. Predictors of poor quality of life included presence of comorbidities, increased length of stay, and a diagnostic category of malignancy. Diagnostic categories of respiratory, trauma, and cardiac dysfunction were associated with a better outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the long-term outcome in terms of quality of life after admission to a pediatric intensive care unit is good or normal for the majority of surviving children. Those children with a poor outcome are likely to have significant comorbidities or a diagnosis of malignancy.},

Our motivation is inference of gene regulatory networks from low-resolution microarray time series, where existence of nonlinear interactions is well known. Parenthood relations are mapped by augmenting the model with kinship indicators and providing these with either an overall or gene-wise hierarchical structure. Appropriate specification of the prior is crucial to control the flexibility of the splines, especially under circumstances of scarce data; thus, we provide an informative, proper prior. Substantive improvement in network inference over a linear model is demonstrated using synthetic data drawn from ordinary differential equation models and gene expression from an experimental data set of the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian rhythm.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: The Children's Asthma Care (CAC) measure set evaluates whether children admitted to hospitals with asthma receive relievers (CAC-1) and systemic corticosteroids (CAC-2) and whether they are discharged with a home management plan of care (CAC-3). It is the only Joint Commission core measure applicable to evaluate the quality of care for hospitalized children. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate longitudinal trends in CAC measure compliance and to determine if an association exists between compliance and outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study using administrative data and CAC compliance data for 30 US children's hospitals. A total of 37,267 children admitted with asthma between January 1, 2008, and September 30, 2010, with follow-up through December 31, 2010, accounted for 45,499 hospital admissions. Hospital-level CAC measure compliance data were obtained from the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions. Readmission and postdischarge emergency department (ED) utilization data were obtained from the Pediatric Health Information System. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Children's Asthma Care measure compliance trends; postdischarge ED utilization and asthma-related readmission rates at 7, 30, and 90 days. RESULTS: The minimum quarterly CAC-1 and CAC-2 measure compliance rates reported by any hospital were 97.1% and 89.5%, respectively. Individual hospital CAC-2 compliance exceeded 95% for 97.9% of the quarters. Lack of variability in CAC-1 and CAC-2 compliance precluded examination of their association with the specified outcomes. Mean CAC-3 compliance was 40.6% (95% CI, 34.1%-47.1%) and 72.9% (95% CI, 68.8%-76.9%) for the initial and final 3 quarters of the study, respectively. The mean 7-, 30-, and 90-day postdischarge ED utilization rates were 1.5% (95% CI, 1.3%-1.6%), 4.3% (95% CI, 4.0%-4.5%), and 11.1% (95% CI, 10.5%-11.7%) and the mean quarterly 7-, 30-, and 90-day readmission rates were 1.4% (95% CI, 1.2%-1.6%), 3.1% (95% CI, 2.8%-3.3%), and 7.6% (95% CI, 7.2%-8.1%). There was no significant association between overall CAC-3 compliance (odds ratio [OR] for 5% improvement in compliance) and postdischarge ED utilization rates at 7 days (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98-1.02), 30 days (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90-1.04), and 90 days (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.18). In addition, there was no significant association between overall CAC-3 compliance (OR for 5% improvement in compliance) and readmission rates at 7 days (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.02), 30 days (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96-1.02), and 90 days (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90-1.12). CONCLUSION: Among children admitted to pediatric hospitals for asthma, there was high hospital-level compliance with CAC-1 and CAC-2 quality measures and moderate compliance with the CAC-3 measure but no association between CAC-3 compliance and subsequent ED visits and asthma-related readmissions.},

  Abstract                 = {Because there are no specific reports, this retrospective study was carried out to assess the clinical outcome of stage I (i.e., T1 N0 M0) head and neck skin squamous cell carcinoma (HNSSCC) and verify the impact of some clinical parameters on prognosis. Seventy-one patients with stages I (i.e., 68 T1 N0 M0) and II (i.e., 3 T2 N0 M0) histologically proven HNSSCC were analyzed, and no lip carcinoma was considered. None was treated before admission, and none had neck nodes (i.e., N0) and/or distant metastasis (i.e., M0). Global disease-specific survival rate at 32 months was 97.2%, irrespective of stage, grading, and type of surgery, and thus, radical tumor resection is a viable procedure for stage I HNSSCC. However, 14 (19.7%) of 71 cases had a relapse within a mean period of 31 months. A second procedure was performed in 12 (85.7%) of 14 cases. In 4 (33.3%) of 12 patients operated on twice, a second relapse was detected after a mean period of 26 months.A second surgical procedure on a relapsed tumor is possible, but a multimodality treatment regimen should be considered.},

The results showed that the greatest activity fraction was associated with aerosol particles in the accumulation size range (100-1000 nm) with a small fraction of nucleation mode (10-100 nm). Regarding the influence of the weather conditions, the decrease in the number of accumulation particles was observed clearly after rainfall without significant change in nucleation particles, which may be due to a washout process for the large particles.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The trend of increasing cervical spine multidirectional computed tomography (MDCT) imaging of pediatric trauma patients is characteristic of the overall dramatic increase in computed tomography utilization in the United States. The purpose of this study is to compare the amount of radiation a pediatric trauma patient absorbs to the thyroid from plain radiographs and MDCT of the cervical spine and to express risk by calculation of theoretical thyroid cancer induction. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of pediatric trauma patients admitted from October 1, 2004, to October 31, 2009, was performed at an academic, Level I trauma center. Inclusion criteria were Level I/II trauma patients, cervical spine imaging performed at our institution, and age <18 years. Absorbed thyroid radiation was calculated for patients receiving plain radiographs or MDCT. Thyroid cancer risk was calculated using the 2006 Biological Effects on Ionizing Radiation VII report. RESULTS: Six hundred seventeen patients met inclusion criteria: 224 received cervical spine radiographs and 393 received cervical spine MDCT. The mean thyroid radiation absorbed from radiographs was 0.90 mGy for males and 0.96 mGy for females compared with 63.6 mGy (males) and 64.2 mGy (females) receiving MDCT (p < 0.001). The median excess relative risk of thyroid cancer induction from one cervical spine MDCT in males was 13.0% and females was 25.0%, compared with 0.24% (males) and 0.51% (females) for radiographs (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The significant difference in radiation that MDCT delivers to the pediatric trauma patient when compared with plain radiographs should temper routine use of computed tomography in pediatric cervical spine clearance algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {There are a number of Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) classification systems that have evolved over the past 2 decades, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. DRG systems are used for case-mix trending, utilization management and quality improvement, comparative reporting, prospective payment, and price negotiations. For any of these applications it is essential to know the accuracy with which the DRG system classifies patients, specifically for predicting resource use and also mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the adequacy of the three most commonly used DRG systems for neonatal patients-Medicare DRGs, All Patient Diagnosis-Related Groups (AP-DRGs), and All Patient Refined Diagnosis-Related Groups (APR-DRGs). A 2-part methodology is used to assess adequacy. The first part is a descriptive analysis that examines the structural characteristics of each system. This provides a framework for understanding the inherent strengths and weaknesses of each system and for interpreting their statistical performance. The second part examines the statistical performance of each system on a large nationally representative hospital database. The analysis identifies major differences in the structure and statistical performance of the three DRG systems for neonates. The Medicare DRGs are structurally the least developed and yield the poorest overall statistical performance (cost R2 = 0.292; mortality R2 = 0.083). The APR-DRGs are structurally the most developed and yield the best statistical performance (cost R2 = 0.627; mortality R2 = 0.416). The AP-DRGs are intermediate to Medicare DRGs and APR-DRGs, although closer to APR-DRGs (cost R2 = 0.507; mortality R2 = 0.304). An analysis of payment impacts and systematic effects identifies there are major systematic biases with the Medicare DRGs. At the patient level, there is substantial underpayment for surgical neonates, transferred-in neonates, neonates discharged to home health services, and neonates who die. In contrast, there is substantial overpayment for normal newborns. At the facility level, there is substantial underpayment for freestanding acute children's hospitals and major teaching general hospitals. There is overpayment for other urban general hospitals but this pattern varies by hospital size. There is very substantial overpayment for other rural hospitals. The AP-DRGs remove the majority of the systematic effects but significant biases remain. The APR-DRGs remove most of the systematic effects but some biases remain.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Patients injured in rural counties are hypothesized to have improved survival if local hospitals are categorized as Level III, Level IV, and Level V trauma centers. METHODS: Data were abstracted on patients with brain, liver, or spleen injuries who were first treated in 16 rural hospitals in Oregon (with categorized trauma centers) and 16 hospitals in Washington (without categorized trauma centers). Logistic regression models evaluated survival up to 30 days after hospital discharge. RESULTS: Among Oregon's 642 study patients, 63% were transferred to another hospital. Among Washington's 624 patients, a higher proportion, 70%, were transferred. Risk-adjusted odds of death for Washington patients (reference odds, 1) were the same as for Oregon patients (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.28). Most patients died after transfer to another hospital. CONCLUSION: In states with a prevailing practice of promptly transferring brain-injured patients, survival of these patients may not be enhanced by categorization of hospitals as rural trauma centers. To further improve the outcome of these patients, policy makers should adjust statewide trauma system guidelines to enhance integration and to perfect coordination among sequential decision makers.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in ventilated critically ill patients. Despite a large amount of research evidence, the optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies for VAP remain controversial. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of VAP. Data sources include Medline, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Register of Controlled Trials. STUDY SELECTION: The authors systematically searched for all relevant randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews on the diagnosis and treatment of VAP in mechanically ventilated adults that were published from 1980 to October 1, 2006. DATA EXTRACTION: Independently and in duplicate, the panel critically appraised each published trial. The effect size, confidence intervals, and homogeneity of the results were scored using predefined definitions. The full guideline development panel arrived at a consensus for scores on safety, feasibility, and economic issues. LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: Based on the scores for each topic, the following statements of recommendation were used: recommend, consider, do not recommend, and no recommendation because of insufficient or conflicting evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: For the diagnosis of VAP in immunocompetent patients, we recommend that endotracheal aspirates with nonquantitative cultures be used as the initial diagnostic strategy. When there is a suspicion of VAP, we recommend empiric antimicrobial therapy (in contrast to delayed or culture directed therapy) and appropriate single agent antimicrobial therapy for each potential pathogen as empiric therapy for VAP. Choice of antibiotics should be based on patient factors and local resistance patterns. We recommend that an antibiotic discontinuation strategy be used in patients who are treated of suspected VAP. For patients who receive adequate initial antibiotic therapy, we recommend 8 days of antibiotic therapy. We do not recommend nebulized endotracheal tobramycin or intratracheal instillation of tobramycin for the treatment of VAP. CONCLUSION: We present evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of VAP. Implementation of these recommendations into clinical practice may lessen the morbidity and mortality of patients who develop VAP.},

STUDY SELECTION: The authors systematically searched for all relevant randomized, controlled trials and systematic reviews on the topic of prevention of VAP in adults that were published from 1980 to October 1, 2006. DATA EXTRACTION: Independently and in duplicate, the panel scored the internal validity of each trial.

Scores for the safety, feasibility, and economic issues were assigned based on consensus of the guideline panel. LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: The following statements were used: recommend, consider, do not recommend, and no recommendation due to insufficient or conflicting evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: To prevent VAP: We recommend: that the orotracheal route of intubation should be used for intubation; a new ventilator circuit for each patient; circuit changes if the circuit becomes soiled or damaged, but no scheduled changes; change of heat and moisture exchangers every 5 to 7 days or as clinically indicated; the use of a closed endotracheal suctioning system changed for each patient and as clinically indicated; subglottic secretion drainage in patients expected to be mechanically ventilated for more than 72 hours; head of bed elevation to 45 degrees (when impossible, as near to 45 degrees as possible should be considered). Consider: the use of rotating beds; oral antiseptic rinses. We do not recommend: use of bacterial filters; the use of iseganan We make no recommendations regarding: the use of a systematic search for sinusitis; type of airway humidification; timing of tracheostomy; prone positioning; aerosolized antibiotics; intranasal mupirocin; topical and/or intravenous antibiotics. CONCLUSION: There are a growing number of evidence-based strategies for VAP prevention, which, if applied in practice, may reduce the incidence of this serious nosocomial infection.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the modeling techniques used for early prediction of outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to identify aspects for potential improvements. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We reviewed key methodological aspects of studies published between 1970 and 2005 that proposed a prognostic model for the Glasgow Outcome Scale of TBI based on admission data. RESULTS: We included 31 papers. Twenty-four were single-center studies, and 22 reported on fewer than 500 patients. The median of the number of initially considered predictors was eight, and on average five of these were selected for the prognostic model, generally including age, Glasgow Coma Score (or only motor score), and pupillary reactivity. The most common statistical technique was logistic regression with stepwise selection of predictors. Model performance was often quantified by accuracy rate rather than by more appropriate measures such as the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve. Model validity was addressed in 15 studies, but mostly used a simple split-sample approach, and external validation was performed in only four studies. CONCLUSION: Although most models agree on the three most important predictors, many were developed on small sample sizes within single centers and hence lack generalizability. Modeling strategies have to be improved, and include external validation.},

  Abstract                 = {Critical injury has been associated with reduction in innate immune function in adults, with infection risk being related to degree of immune suppression. This relationship has not been reported in critically injured children.Innate immune function will be reduced in critically injured children, and the degree of reduction will predict the subsequent development of nosocomial infection.Children (≤18 years old) were enrolled in this longitudinal, prospective, observational, single-center study after admission to the pediatric intensive care unit following critical injury, along with a cohort of outpatient controls. Serial blood sampling was performed to evaluate plasma cytokine levels and innate immune function as measured by ex vivo lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) production capacity.Seventy-six critically injured children (and 21 outpatient controls) were enrolled. Sixteen critically injured subjects developed nosocomial infection. Those subjects had higher plasma interleukin 6 and interleukin 10 levels on posttrauma days 1-2 compared with those who recovered without infection and outpatient controls. Ex vivo lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α production capacity was lower on posttrauma days 1-2 (P = 0.006) and over the first week following injury (P = 0.04) in those who went on to develop infection. A TNF-α response of less than 520 pg/mL at any time in the first week after injury was highly associated with infection risk by univariate and multivariate analysis. Among transfused children, longer red blood cell storage age, not transfusion volume, was associated with lower innate immune function (P < 0.0001). Trauma-induced innate immune suppression was reversible ex vivo via coculture of whole blood with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.Trauma-induced innate immune suppression is common in critically injured children and is associated with increased risks for the development of nosocomial infection. Potential exacerbating factors, including red blood cell transfusion, and potential therapies for pediatric trauma-induced innate immune suppression are deserving of further study.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA) is used for the treatment of adults with severe sepsis who have a high risk of dying. A phase 1b open-label study has indicated that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of DrotAA are similar in children and adults. We initiated the RESOLVE (REsearching severe Sepsis and Organ dysfunction in children: a gLobal perspectiVE) trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of the drug in children. METHODS: Children aged between 38 weeks' corrected gestational age and 17 years with sepsis-induced cardiovascular and respiratory failure were randomly assigned to receive placebo or DrotAA (24 microg/kg/h) for 96 h. We used a prospectively defined, novel primary endpoint of Composite Time to Complete Organ Failure Resolution (CTCOFR) score. Secondary endpoints were 28-day mortality, major amputations, and safety. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT00049764. FINDINGS: 477 patients were enrolled; 237 received placebo, and 240 DrotAA. Our results showed no significant difference between groups in CTCOFR score (p=0.72) or in 28-day mortality (placebo 17.5%; DrotAA, 17.2%; p=0.93). Although there was no difference in overall serious bleeding events during the 28-day study period (placebo 6.8%; DrotAA 6.7%; p=0.97), there were numerically more instances of CNS bleeding in the DrotAA group (11 [4.6%], vs 5 [2.1%] in placebo, p=0.13), particularly in children younger than 60 days. For CTCOFR score days 1-14, correlation coefficient was -0.016 (95% CI -0.106 to 0.74); relative risk for 28-day mortality was 1.06 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.46) for DrotAA compared with placebo. INTERPRETATION: Although we did not record any efficacy of DrotAA in children with severe sepsis, serious bleeding events were similar between groups and the overall safety profile acceptable, except in children younger than 60 days. However, we gained important insights into clinical and laboratory characteristics of childhood severe sepsis, and have identified issues that need to be addressed in future trials in critically ill children.},

Of the 9418 pages in the maternity magazines, 46 pages were on infants, 16 pages on pregnant women and 162 pages displayed advertisements. Of the 9750 pages in the baby magazines, 34 pages of articles addressed CSS use; no articles addressed the issue of pregnant women; 83 pages were advertisements. Although the magazines showed accurate information in general; its amount was not sufficient, and little specific information on appropriate use and selection of a CSS was seen. Some information was misleading and even incorrect: specifically related to when to start using a forward-facing seat, what products are attachable to the CSS, and the reuse of a CSS. Greater amounts and accuracy of safety information in these magazines would help pregnant women and parents acquire important safety knowledge that healthcare providers are falling short of providing in Japan.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The use of carotid stenting is rising across the United States. How physician specialty relates to its utilization rates or outcomes is uncertain. METHODS: We performed an observational analysis of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older undergoing carotid stenting between 2005 and 2007 in 306 hospital referral regions (HRRs). We first determined how frequently carotid stenting was performed by different specialists within each HRR and then used multivariable regression models to compare population-based utilization rates and 30-day outcomes for this procedure across HRRs based on the proportion performed by cardiologists, surgeons, radiologists, or a mix of specialists. RESULTS: In 272 HRRs where at least 15 procedures were performed during the study period, we identified 28 700 carotid stenting procedures performed by 2588 operators. While cardiologists made up approximately one-third of these operators, they were responsible for 14 919 (52.0%) procedures. Significant differences were noted in the characteristics of patients treated by cardiologists compared with other specialties, including higher rates of invasive cardiac procedures and lower rates of acute stroke or transient ischemic attacks in the 180 days prior to carotid stenting. Population-based utilization rates were significantly higher in HRRs where cardiologists performed most procedures relative to HRRs where most were done by other specialists or a mix of specialists (P < .001). In contrast, risk-standardized outcomes did not differ across HRRs based on physician specialty. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid stenting is being performed by operators from diverse specialties. Hospital referral regions where cardiologists perform most procedures have higher population-based utilization rates with similar outcomes.},

SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit in a university-affiliated children's hospital. DESIGN/METHODS: Information for 2005-2006 admissions was obtained from pediatric intensive care unit database, and long-term outcome was ascertained through telephone interviews. Results were compared to previous cohorts from 1982 and 1995. RESULTS: A total of 4010 children were admitted on 5250 occasions. Readmissions increased from 11% for 1982 to 31% in 2005 to 2006 (p < .001). In 2005-2006, fewer children were admitted after accidents (p < .001), or with croup (p < .001), or epiglottitis (p = .01), and 8% were treated with noninvasive ventilation compared to none in 1982 (p < .0001). Among children aged > or =1 month, pediatric intensive care unit length of stay remained constant. The risk of death predicted by the Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) remained constant (approximately 6%) between 1995 and 2005-2006.The proportion that died in the pediatric intensive care unit fell from 11.0% in 1982 to 4.8% in 2005-2006 (p < .001). Among children aged >/=1 month, proportion admitted with a preexisting moderate or severe disability was similar: 12.0% in 1982 and 14.6% in 2005-2006 (p = .11), but the proportion with a moderate or severe disability at follow-up increased from 8.4% in 1982 to 17.9% in 2005-2006 (p < .001). The proportion of children aged > or =1 month who either died in the pediatric intensive care unit or survived with disability did not improve: it was 19.4% in 1982 and 22.7% in 2005-2006. CONCLUSION: Over the last three decades, the length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit and the severity of illness have not changed, but there has been a substantial reduction in pediatric intensive care unit mortality. However, the proportion of survivors with moderate or severe disability increased significantly. Some children who would have been allowed to die in 1982 and 1995 were kept alive in 2005-2006, but survived with disability. This trend has important implications for our patients and their families, and for the community as a whole.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Nonoperative management of solid organ injuries (SOI) in children is now the standard of care. Little is know regarding the time to failure for those children requiring operative intervention. We sought to delineate this timeline to operative intervention for the subset of single solid organ injured patients requiring laparotomy. METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) was queried for the period 1991 to 2003 for all children (age <15) with a single abdominal SOI (kidney, liver, spleen). Children with significant associated head injury (Abbreviated Injury Score; AIS >2) were excluded. Data abstracted included age, organ injury and severity (ICD-9, AIS), and operative procedures. Survival analysis methods were used to evaluate equality of hazard rates (indicating rate of operative intervention by hour). RESULTS: For the period of review, the NTDB contained 2,013 children with a single SOI including 1,813 eligible for review. The mean age was 9.2 +/- 3.8 years with a mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 8.6 +/- 6.3. The study population included 224 (12.4%) kidney injuries, 488 (26.9%) liver injuries, and 1,101 (60.7%) splenic injuries. A total of 120 (6.6%) of the patients required an operation for their solid organ injury. The median time to operation was 2.4 hours with 61.7% undergoing surgery within 3 hours of arrival, 79.4% within 6 hours, and 89.7% within 24 hours. The operative intervention rate was greatest for splenic injuries (8.7%) followed by liver (3.5%) and kidney (3.1%) injuries. Hazard rates varied significantly by organ injured (p < 0.001) and peaked at 1.5 hours for liver, 2 hours for spleen, and 4.5 hours for kidney. Hazard rates varied significantly by injury severity (p < 0.001) with a peak time to surgery for all severity at 2 hours postadmission. CONCLUSION: Although the patterns for peak time to operative intervention varied for the specific organs injured and injury severity, the need for operative intervention for children with an SOI is established for the vast majority of children within 24 hours of admission.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Nonoperative management of a solid organ injury (SVI) is accepted in the stable pediatric trauma patient. A concern with nonoperative management is missing a hollow visceral injury (HVI). Factors that may help predict HVI have not been well documented. METHODS: The National Pediatric Trauma Registry was reviewed for the period October 1988 through September 1998 for all blunt injured, hemodynamically stable pediatric patients (age < or =12 years) with an SVI (kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen) of Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score > or =2. HVIs included AIS > or =2 gastrointestinal tract injuries. RESULTS: For the decade of review, 2,977 pediatric patients sustained an SVI, including 96 with an HVI (3.2%). The mean age was 6.6 years, with a mean Injury Severity Score of 12.4. An occupant in a motor vehicle accident was the most common injury mechanism (30.4%), but assault was the most likely to result in an HVI (11.5%). The liver was the most common SVI (n = 1,400), the spleen the least likely to have an associated HVI (2.5%). Pancreatic injuries had a higher rate of HVI (P < .001). The majority of patients had a single SVI (n = 2,507) with 71 associated HVIs (2.8%). The risk of associated HVI increased as the number of solid organs injured increased: 4.7% with 2 organs, 13.5% if 3 organs were injured (P< .001). In patients with a single SVI, the rate of HVI did not differ as AIS increased (range, 2.7% to 6.5%, Pvalue not significant). CONCLUSIONS: The overall rate of HVI was low (3.2%). Higher rates of HVI were found in assaulted patients and patients with multiple SVIs or pancreatic injuries. The risk of associated HVI was dependent more on number of SVIs than severity of the individual organ injury. This data suggest that nonoperative management is justified in the patient with a single SVI but should be used cautiously in the patient with multiple SVI or a pancreatic injury.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: As nonoperative management of blunt abdominal trauma has become more popular, reliable models for predicting the likelihood of concomitant hollow viscus injury in the hemodynamically stable patient with a solid viscus injury are increasingly important. METHODS: The Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation registry was reviewed for the period from January 1992 to December 1995 for all adult (age > 12 years) patients with blunt trauma and an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score > or = 2 for a solid viscus (kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen). Patients with an initial systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg were excluded. Hollow viscus injuries included only lacerations or perforations of the gallbladder, gastrointestinal tract, or urinary tract. RESULTS: In the 4-year period, 3,089 patients sustained solid viscus injuries, 296 of whom had a hollow viscus injury (9.6%). The mean age was 35.6 years, mean Injury Severity Score was 22.2, and mean Revised Trauma Score was 7.3; 63.3% of the patients were male. A solitary solid viscus injury occurred in 2,437 patients (79%), 177 of whom (7.3%) had a hollow viscus injury. The frequency of hollow viscus injury increased with the number of solid organs injured: 15.4% of patients with two solid viscus injuries (n = 547) and 34.4% of patients with three solid viscus injuries (n = 96) suffered a concomitant hollow viscus injury (p < 0.001 vs. one organ). A hollow viscus injury was 2.3 times more likely for two solid viscus injuries and 6.7 times more likely for three solid viscus injuries compared with a solitary solid viscus injury. For solitary solid viscus injury, the frequency of hollow viscus injury varied little with increasing AIS score (AIS score 2, 6.6%; AIS score 3, 8.2%; AIS score 4, 9.2%; AIS score 5, 6.2%) (p = 0.27 between groups), suggesting that the incidence of hollow viscus injury is related more to the number of solid visceral injuries than the severity of individual organ injury. Also, when the sum of the AIS scores for solid viscus injuries was <6, the mean rate of hollow viscus injury was 7.8%. This increased to 22.8% when the sum of the AIS scores for solid viscus injury was > or =6 (p < 0.001). A pancreatic injury in combination with any other solid viscus injury had a rate of hollow viscus injury of >33%. CONCLUSION: A model of organ injury scaling predicted hollow viscus injury. Multiple solid viscus injuries, particularly pancreatic, or abdominal solid viscus injuries with an AIS score > or = 6, were predictive of hollow viscus injury. Identification of these injury patterns should prompt consideration for early operative intervention.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the utility of dental professionals in providing smoking cessation counselling in the UK. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine quit rates for smokers with chronic periodontitis who were referred to a dental hospital for treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine subjects with chronic periodontitis who smoked cigarettes were recruited. All subjects received periodontal treatment and smoking cessation advice as part of an individual, patient-based programme provided by dental hygienists trained in smoking cessation counselling. Smoking cessation interventions included counselling (all patients), and some patients also received nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and/or Zyban medication. Smoking cessation advice was given at each visit at which periodontal treatment was undertaken (typically four to six visits) over a period of 10-12 weeks. Smoking cessation advice was also given monthly during the programme of supportive periodontal care over the following nine months. Smoking status was recorded at three, six and 12 months and was confirmed with carbon monoxide (CO) monitors and salivary cotinine assays. RESULTS: Forty-one per cent, 33%, 29% and 25% of patients had stopped smoking at week four, months three, six and 12, respectively. Gender, age, the presence of another smoker in the household, and baseline smoking status (determined using subject-reported pack years of smoking) were not significant predictors of quit success (P < 0.05). Baseline CO levels were significantly associated with quit success, however, and were significantly higher in those subjects who continued to smoke compared to those subjects who were quitters at week four, month three and month six (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Success rates in quitting smoking following smoking cessation advice given as part of a periodontal treatment compared very favourably to national quit rates achieved in specialist smoking cessation clinics. The dental profession has a crucial role to play in smoking cessation counselling, particularly for patients with chronic periodontitis.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Transporting all trauma patients to regional trauma centers is inefficient; however, the bypass of nearer, nondesignated hospitals in deference to regional trauma centers decreases mortality in the severely injured. One approach to improving efficiency is to allow the initial assessment of selected patients at lower level (Level III/IV) designated centers. We set out to evaluate whether patients initially assessed at these centers and then transferred to a Level I facility were adversely affected by delays to definitive care. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study in which the primary exposure being evaluated is initial assessment at a Level III or IV trauma center before transport to a Level I center in an urban setting. The outcomes in this transfer cohort were compared with outcomes in patients transported directly from the scene to a Level I center (direct cohort). The outcomes of interest were mortality, length of stay, and hospital charges. Multivariate analyses were used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics across these two cohorts. RESULTS: Crude length of stay was comparable, whereas mortality was lower and charges were 40% higher in the transfer cohort (n = 281) compared with the direct cohort (n = 4,439). After adjusting for confounders, mortality and length of stay were similar and total charges were significantly greater in the transferred patients. CONCLUSION: Interfacility transfers in a mature urban trauma system do not appear to impact on clinical outcome. However, transfer patients use significantly greater resources as measured by hospital charges. This effect is likely because of the nature of their injuries or, alternatively, delays in reaching definitive care.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: The premise underlying regionalization of trauma care is that larger volumes of trauma patients cared for in fewer institutions will lead to improved outcomes. However, whether a relationship exists between institutional volume and trauma outcomes remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between trauma center volume and outcomes of trauma patients. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Thirty-one academic level I or level II trauma centers across the United States participating in the University Healthsystem Consortium Trauma Benchmarking Study. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with penetrating abdominal injury (PAI; n = 478) discharged between November 1, 1997, and July 31, 1998, or with multisystem blunt trauma (minimum of head injury and lower-extremity long-bone fractures; n = 541) discharged between June 1 and December 31, 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inpatient mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS), comparing high-volume (>650 trauma admissions/y) and low-volume (</=650 admissions/y) centers. RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment for patient characteristics and injury severity, the relative odds of death was 0.02 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.002-0.25) for patients with PAI admitted with shock to high-volume centers compared with low-volume centers. No benefit was evident in patients without shock (P =.50). The adjusted odds of death in patients with multisystem blunt trauma who presented with coma to a high-volume center was 0.49 (95% CI, 0.26-0.93) vs low-volume centers. No benefit was observed in patients without coma (P =.05). Additionally, a shorter LOS was observed in patients with PAI and New Injury Severity Scores of 16 or higher (difference in adjusted mean LOS, 1.6 days [95% CI, -1.5 to 4.7 days]) and in all patients with multisystem blunt trauma admitted to higher-volume centers (difference in adjusted mean LOS, 3.3 days [95% CI, 0.91-5.70 days]). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a strong association exists between trauma center volume and outcomes, with significant improvements in mortality and LOS when volume exceeds 650 cases per year. These benefits are only evident in patients at high risk for adverse outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {RATIONALE: Intravenous self-administration of cocaine at low doses is increased by chronic low-level exposure to lead during gestation and lactation (perinatal lead exposure). Insofar as drug potency is increased by early lead exposure, it must be considered that cocaine-seeking and relapse after periods of withdrawal similarly may be enhanced by perinatal lead exposure. OBJECTIVES: Employing an animal model, the present study examined the effects of lead exposure during gestation and lactation on cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking, when animals were tested as adults. METHODS: Adult female rats were gavaged once daily with 0 or 16 mg lead for 30 days prior to breeding with non-exposed males. This exposure regimen continued until offspring were weaned at postnatal day (PND) 21. At PND 120, male offspring were trained to self-administer cocaine intravenously (IV) [0.50 mg/kg cocaine per infusion on a fixed-ratio schedule where two lever presses resulted in drug delivery (FR-2 schedule)]. After steady-state responding was established, cocaine reinstatement responding was assessed for each group within an extinction paradigm. During the initial 1 h of reinstatement testing, the previous baseline contingencies were in place, i.e. animals operated under an FR-2 schedule for an infusion of 0.50 mg/kg cocaine. During the 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h of testing saline infusions were substituted for cocaine infusions. After responding extinguished during hour 4, reinstatement of responding was tested by administering an intraperitoneal (IP) priming injection of 0.00, 5.00, 10.00, or 20.00 mg/kg cocaine. Following these injections, lever responding for saline infusions was monitored during hour 5. RESULTS: The number of saline infusions self-administered during hour 5 increased in a dose-dependent fashion for both controls (group 0-mg) and lead-exposed (group 16-mg) animals. However, lead-exposed animals self-administered significantly more saline infusions than controls at the 5.00 mg/kg and 10.00 mg/kg doses. This apparent metal-related increase in sensitivity to cocaine was evident with blood lead in metal-exposed test animals returning to control levels. However, brain lead levels remained elevated in lead-exposed test animals, relative to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation suggest that low-level lead exposure during gestation and lactation increases sensitivity to the relapse phase of drug abuse. It is further apparent that this increased sensitivity to the reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior is long-lasting.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between the frequencies of pharmaceutical exposures reported to a poison control center (PCC) and those seen in the emergency department (ED). DESIGN: A statewide population-based retrospective comparison of frequencies of ED pharmaceutical poisonings with frequencies of pharmaceutical exposures reported to a regional PCC. ED poisonings, identified by International Classification of Diseases, Version 9 (ICD-9) codes, were grouped into substance categories. Using a reproducible algorithm facilitated by probabilistic linkage, codes from the PCC classification system were mapped into the same categories. A readily identifiable subset of PCC calls was selected for comparison. MEASUREMENTS: Correlations between frequencies of quarterly exposures by substance categories were calculated using Pearson correlation coefficients and partial correlation coefficients with adjustment for seasonality. RESULTS: PCC reported exposures correlated with ED poisonings in nine of 10 categories. Partial correlation coefficients (r(p)) indicated strong associations (r(p)>0.8) for three substance categories that underwent large changes in their incidences (opiates, benzodiazepines, and muscle relaxants). Six substance categories were moderately correlated (r(p)>0.6). One category, salicylates, showed no association. Limitations Imperfect overlap between ICD-9 and PCC codes may have led to miscategorization. Substances without changes in exposure frequency have inadequate variability to detect association using this method. CONCLUSION: PCC data are able to effectively identify trends in poisonings seen in EDs and may be useful as part of a pharmaceutical poisoning surveillance system. The authors developed an algorithm-driven technique for mapping American Association of Poison Control Centers codes to ICD-9 codes and identified a useful subset of poison control exposures for analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Millions of patients are discharged from intensive care units annually. These intensive care survivors and their families frequently report a wide range of impairments in their health status which may last for months and years after hospital discharge. OBJECTIVES: To report on a 2-day Society of Critical Care Medicine conference aimed at improving the long-term outcomes after critical illness for patients and their families. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one invited stakeholders participated in the conference. Stakeholders represented key professional organizations and groups, predominantly from North America, which are involved in the care of intensive care survivors after hospital discharge. DESIGN: Invited experts and Society of Critical Care Medicine members presented a summary of existing data regarding the potential long-term physical, cognitive and mental health problems after intensive care and the results from studies of postintensive care unit interventions to address these problems. Stakeholders provided reactions, perspectives, concerns and strategies aimed at improving care and mitigating these long-term health problems. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three major themes emerged from the conference regarding: (1) raising awareness and education, (2) understanding and addressing barriers to practice, and (3) identifying research gaps and resources. Postintensive care syndrome was agreed upon as the recommended term to describe new or worsening problems in physical, cognitive, or mental health status arising after a critical illness and persisting beyond acute care hospitalization. The term could be applied to either a survivor or family member. CONCLUSIONS: Improving care for intensive care survivors and their families requires collaboration between practitioners and researchers in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Strategies were developed to address the major themes arising from the conference to improve outcomes for survivors and families.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: There are barriers to providing early physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) in the intensive care unit (ICU). We present a specific model for undertaking quality improvement (QI) projects and a case study focused on QI for early PM&R in the ICU. METHODS: The QI project was undertaken using a 4-step model: (1) summarizing the evidence, (2) identifying barriers, (3) establishing performance measures, and (4) ensuring patients receive the intervention. To evaluate the application and outcomes of this model, we present data collected during a 4-month QI period versus an immediately preceding 3-month control period. RESULTS: Deep sedation was a major barrier to early PM&R that was addressed in the QI project. Compared to the control period, there was a decrease in medical ICU (MICU) days with any benzodiazepine use (73% vs 96% of days, P = .03) and narcotic use (77% vs 96%, P = .05) and improved delirium status (MICU days without delirium, 53% vs 21%, P = .003). In addition, more QI patients had physical therapy consultations (93% vs 59%, P = .004) and greater number of rehabilitation treatments with higher functional mobility (treatments involving sitting or greater mobility, 78% vs 56%, P = .03). Hospital data for the QI period demonstrated a decrease in average length of stay in the MICU (4.9 vs 7.0 days, P = .02) and hospital (14.1 vs 17.2, P = .03) compared to the prior year. CONCLUSION: A structured QI model can be applied to implementation of early PM&R in the ICU resulting in markedly improved delirium status, delivery of PM&R, functional mobility, and length of stay.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To (1) reduce deep sedation and delirium to permit mobilization, (2) increase the frequency of rehabilitation consultations and treatments to improve patients' functional mobility, and (3) evaluate effects on length of stay. DESIGN: Seven-month prospective before/after quality improvement project. SETTING: Sixteen-bed medical intensive care unit (MICU) in academic hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 57 patients mechanically ventilated 4 days or longer. INTERVENTION: A multidisciplinary team focused on reducing heavy sedation and increasing MICU staffing to include full-time physical and occupational therapists with new consultation guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sedation and delirium status, rehabilitation treatments, functional mobility. RESULTS: Compared with before the quality improvement project, benzodiazepine use decreased markedly (proportion of MICU days that patients received benzodiazepines [50% vs 25%, P=.002]), with lower median daily sedative doses (47 vs 15 mg midazolam equivalents [P=.09] and 71 vs 24 mg morphine equivalents [P=.01]). Patients had improved sedation and delirium status (MICU days alert [30% vs 67%, P<.001] and not delirious [21% vs 53%, P=.003]). There were a greater median number of rehabilitation treatments per patient (1 vs 7, P<.001) with a higher level of functional mobility (treatments involving sitting or greater mobility, 56% vs 78%, P=.03). Hospital administrative data demonstrated that across all MICU patients, there was a decrease in intensive care unit and hospital length of stay by 2.1 (95% confidence interval: 0.4-3.8) and 3.1 (0.3-5.9) days, respectively, and a 20% increase in MICU admissions compared with the same period in the prior year. CONCLUSIONS: Using a quality improvement process, intensive care unit delirium, physical rehabilitation, and functional mobility were markedly improved and associated with decreased length of stay.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: The need for an accurate lesion segmentation tool in 18FDG PET is a prerequisite for the estimation of lesion response to therapy, for radionuclide dosimetry, and for the application of 18FDG PET to radiotherapy planning. In this work, the authors have developed an iterative method based on a mathematical fit deduced from Monte Carlo simulations to estimate tumor segmentation thresholds. METHODS: The GATE software, a GEANT4 based Monte Carlo tool, was used to model the GE Advance PET scanner geometry. Spheres ranging between 1 and 6 cm in diameters were simulated in a 10 cm high and 11 cm in diameter cylinder. The spheres were filled with water-equivalent density and simulated in both water and lung equivalent background. The simulations were performed with an infinite, 8/1, and 4/1 target-to-background ratio (T/B). A mathematical fit describing the correlation between the lesion volume and the corresponding optimum threshold value was then deduced through analysis of the reconstructed images. An iterative method, based on this mathematical fit, was developed to determine the optimum threshold value. The effects of the lesion volume and T/B on the threshold value were investigated. This method was evaluated experimentally using the NEMA NU2-2001 IEC phantom, the ACNP cardiac phantom, a randomly deformed aluminum can, and a spheroidal shape phantom implemented artificially in the lung, liver, and brain of patient PET images. Clinically, the algorithm was evaluated in six lesions from five patients. Clinical results were compared to CT volumes. RESULTS: This mathematical fit predicts an existing relationship between the PET lesion size and the percent of maximum activity concentration within the target volume (or threshold). It also showed a dependence of the threshold value on the T/B, which could be eliminated by background subtraction. In the phantom studies, the volumes of the segmented PET targets in the PET images were within 10% of the nominal ones. Clinically, the PET target volumes were also within 10% of those measured from CT images. CONCLUSIONS: This iterative algorithm enabled accurately segment PET lesions, independently of their contrast value.},

  Abstract                 = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and acquired disability in the pediatric population worldwide. We hypothesized that electroencephalography (EEG) synchrony and its temporal variability, analyzed during the acute phase following TBI, would be altered from that of normal children and as such would offer insights into TBI pathophysiology. Seventeen pediatric patients with mild to severe head injury admitted to a pediatric critical care unit were recruited along with 10 age- and gender-matched controls. Patients had two electroencephalographs performed 3 days apart. Outcome was measured at 1 year post-TBI utilizing the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score (PCPC). Maximal synchrony between EEG channels correlated to areas of primary injury as seen on computed tomography (CT) scan. The temporal variability of phase synchronization among EEG electrodes increased as patients recovered and emerged from coma (p < 0.001). This temporal variability correlated with outcome (Pearson coefficient of 0.74) better than the worst Glasgow Coma Scale score, length of coma, or extent of injury on CT scan. This represents a novel approach in the evaluation of TBI in children.},

  Abstract                 = {Pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalization and readmission in children. Understanding the patient characteristics associated with pneumonia readmissions is necessary to inform interventions to reduce avoidable hospitalizations and related costs. The objective of this study was to characterize readmission rates, and identify factors and costs associated with readmission among children previously hospitalized with pneumonia.Retrospective cohort study of children hospitalized with pneumonia at the 43 hospitals included in the Pediatric Health Information System between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2011. The primary outcome was all-cause readmission within 30 days after hospital discharge, and the secondary outcome was pneumonia-specific readmission. We used multivariable regression models to identify patient and hospital characteristics and costs associated with readmission.A total of 82 566 children were hospitalized with pneumonia (median age, 3 years; interquartile range 1-7). Thirty-day all-cause and pneumonia-specific readmission rates were 7.7\% and 3.1\%, respectively. Readmission rates were higher among children <1 year of age, as well as in patients with previous hospitalizations, longer index hospitalizations, and complicated pneumonia. Children with chronic medical conditions were more likely to experience all-cause (odds ratio 3.0; 95\% confidence interval 2.8-3.2) and pneumonia-specific readmission (odds ratio 1.8; 95\% confidence interval 1.7-2.0) compared with children without chronic medical conditions. The median cost of a readmission ($11 344) was higher than that of an index admission ($4495; P = .01). Readmissions occurred in 8\% of pneumonia hospitalizations but accounted for 16.3\% of total costs for all pneumonia hospitalizations.Readmissions are common after hospitalization for pneumonia, especially among young children and those with chronic medical conditions, and are associated with substantial costs.},

  Abstract                 = {Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) assist clinicians in making appropriate diagnostic and treatment decisions based on available evidence. The objective of this study was to describe the availability and content of institutional community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) CPGs, and to evaluate the association between institutional CPGs and care utilization, antibiotic administration, and outcomes among children hospitalized with CAP.This multicenter retrospective cohort study included children aged 1 to 18 years hospitalized with CAP from July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2011. CPGs from each institution were reviewed to abstract information regarding diagnostic testing and antimicrobial selection. We compared overall and specific utilization patterns, antimicrobial use, and hospital length of stay (LOS) for children with CAP between hospitals with and without CPGs.Thirteen (31.7\%) of 41 hospitals had an institutional CPG for nonsevere CAP. There was marked heterogeneity among CPGs. Among the 19,710 children hospitalized with CAP, cost of care, hospital LOS, and 14-day readmission rate were not associated with the presence of a CPG. CPGs did not influence ordering patterns for most diagnostic tests, including blood culture and chest radiographs. Penicillin or aminopenicillins were prescribed to 46.3\% of children at institutions where a CPG recommended the use of these antibiotics as first-line agents compared with 23.9\% of children at institutions without a CPG (odds ratio = 2.7; 95\% confidence interval = 1.4-5.5).The availability of a CAP CPG had minimal impact on resource utilization and was not associated with cost or hospital LOS. Institutional CPGs, however, did influence patterns of antimicrobial use.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Although chest radiography is commonly used to establish the diagnosis of pneumonia in children, the reliability of radiographic findings among radiologists is not well described. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of radiographic features commonly described by radiologists in childhood pneumonia. METHODS: Prospective case-based study. One hundred and ten radiographs of children evaluated in a pediatric emergency department for suspicion of pneumonia were interpreted by six radiologists at two academic children's hospitals. Radiologists were blinded to the clinical history. Reliability of standardized radiographic features was evaluated using the kappa statistic. RESULTS: The radiographic finding of an alveolar infiltrate demonstrated substantial reliability among radiologists (kappa = 0.69). The presence of 'any infiltrate' and pleural effusion demonstrated moderate reliability (kappa = 0.47 and k=0.45, respectively). Other radiographic features were less reliable: air bronchograms (kappa = 0.32), hilar adenopathy (kappa = 0.21), and interstitial infiltrate (kappa = 0.14). Similarly, the finding of alveolar infiltrate demonstrated substantial intra-rater reliability upon review of ten duplicate radiographs, whereas interstitial infiltrate was less reliable. CONCLUSION: The radiographic finding of an alveolar infiltrate is very reliable among pediatric radiologists, whereas the finding of an interstitial infiltrate is less reliable.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) developed guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); however, there are sparse data on actual rates of antibiotic use in the emergency department (ED) setting. METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) for ED visits during 1993 through 2008 for adults with a diagnosis of pneumonia. RESULTS: During the study period there were an estimated 23,252,000 pneumonia visits, representing 1.8% of all ED visits. The visit rate for pneumonia during this 16-year period may have increased (p trend = 0.055). Overall, 66% of adult patients with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia had documentation of an antibiotic administered while in the ED. There was an increase in antibiotic administration for adults with pneumonia from 1993 through 2008 (49% to 80%; p trend < 0.001). Specifically, there was an increase in use of macrolides from 1993 to 2006 (20% to 30%, p trend < 0.001) and a marked increase in use of quinolones from 0% to 39% from 1993 through 2008 (p trend < 0.001). Penicillin and cephalosporin use remained stable. Use of an antibiotic consistent with 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines increased from 22% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 16% to 27%) of cases in 1993-1994 to 68% (95% CI = 63% to 73%) of cases in 2007-2008 (p trend < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ED visit rates for pneumonia increased slightly from 1993 through 2008. Although antibiotic administration in the ED has increased for adults with CAP, guideline-concordant antibiotics may not be consistently administered.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: The objective was to evaluate the process of using existing data sources, probabilistic linkage, and multiple imputation to create large population-based injury databases matched to outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of injured children and adults transported by 94 emergency medical systems (EMS) agencies to 122 hospitals in seven regions of the western United States over a 36-month period (2006 to 2008). All injured patients evaluated by EMS personnel within specific geographic catchment areas were included, regardless of field disposition or outcome. The authors performed probabilistic linkage of EMS records to four hospital and postdischarge data sources (emergency department [ED] data, patient discharge data, trauma registries, and vital statistics files) and then handled missing values using multiple imputation. The authors compare and evaluate matched records, match rates (proportion of matches among eligible patients), and injury outcomes within and across sites. RESULTS: There were 381,719 injured patients evaluated by EMS personnel in the seven regions. Among transported patients, match rates ranged from 14.9% to 87.5% and were directly affected by the availability of hospital data sources and proportion of missing values for key linkage variables. For vital statistics records (1-year mortality), estimated match rates ranged from 88.0% to 98.7%. Use of multiple imputation (compared to complete case analysis) reduced bias for injury outcomes, although sample size, percentage missing, type of variable, and combined-site versus single-site imputation models all affected the resulting estimates and variance. CONCLUSIONS: This project demonstrates the feasibility and describes the process of constructing population-based injury databases across multiple phases of care using existing data sources and commonly available analytic methods. Attention to key linkage variables and decisions for handling missing values can be used to increase match rates between data sources, minimize bias, and preserve sampling design.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The validity of using adult physiologic criteria to triage injured children in the out-of-hospital setting remains unproven. Among children meeting adult field physiologic criteria, we assessed the availability of physiologic information, the incidence of death or prolonged hospitalization, and whether age-specific criteria would improve the specificity of the physiologic triage step. METHODS: We analyzed a prospective, out-of-hospital cohort of injured children aged < or =14 years collected from December 2005 through February 2007 by 237 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies transporting to 207 acute care hospitals (trauma and nontrauma centers) in 11 sites across the United States and Canada. Inclusion criteria were standard adult physiologic values: systolic blood pressure (SBP) < or =90 mmHg, respiratory rate < 10 or > 29 breaths/min, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < or =12, and field intubation attempt. Seven physiologic variables (including age-specific values) and three demographic and mechanism variables were included in the analysis. "High-risk" children included those who died (field or in-hospital) or were hospitalized > 2 days. The decision tree was derived and validated using binary recursive partitioning. RESULTS: Nine hundred fifty-five children were included in the analysis, of whom 62 (6.5%) died and 117 (12.3%) were hospitalized > 2 days. Missing values were common, ranging from 6% (respiratory rate) to 53% (pulse oximetry), and were associated with younger age and high-risk outcome. The final decision rule included four variables (assisted ventilation, GCS score < 11, pulse oximetry < 95%, and SBP > 96 mmHg), which demonstrated improved specificity (71.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 66.7-76.6%]) at the expense of missing high-risk children (sensitivity 76.5% [95% CI 66.4-86.6%]). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of high-risk injured children meeting adult physiologic criteria is relatively low and the findings from this sample do not support using age-specific values to better identify such children. However, the amount and pattern of missing data may compromise the value and practical use of field physiologic information in pediatric triage.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: The first hour after the onset of out-of-hospital traumatic injury is referred to as the "golden hour," yet the relationship between time and outcome remains unclear. We evaluate the association between emergency medical services (EMS) intervals and mortality among trauma patients with field-based physiologic abnormality. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of an out-of-hospital, prospective cohort registry of adult (aged > or =15 years) trauma patients transported by 146 EMS agencies to 51 Level I and II trauma hospitals in 10 sites across North America from December 1, 2005, through March 31, 2007. Inclusion criteria were systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg, respiratory rate less than 10 or greater than 29 breaths/min, Glasgow Coma Scale score less than or equal to 12, or advanced airway intervention. The outcome was in-hospital mortality. We evaluated EMS intervals (activation, response, on-scene, transport, and total time) with logistic regression and 2-step instrumental variable models, adjusted for field-based confounders. RESULTS: There were 3,656 trauma patients available for analysis, of whom 806 (22.0%) died. In multivariable analyses, there was no significant association between time and mortality for any EMS interval: activation (odds ratio [OR] 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95 to 1.05), response (OR 1.00; 95% CI 9.97 to 1.04), on-scene (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.01), transport (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01), or total EMS time (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.01). Subgroup and instrumental variable analyses did not qualitatively change these findings. CONCLUSION: In this North American sample, there was no association between EMS intervals and mortality among injured patients with physiologic abnormality in the field.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: A systematic review of weaning and extubation for pediatric patients on mechanical ventilation. DATA SELECTION: Pediatric and adult literature, English language. STUDY SELECTION: Invited review. DATA SOURCES: Literature review using National Library of Medicine PubMed from January 1972 until April 2008, earlier cross-referenced article citations, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Internet. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the importance of minimizing time on mechanical ventilation, only limited guidance on weaning and extubation is available from the pediatric literature. A significant proportion of patients being evaluated for weaning are actually ready for extubation, suggesting that weaning is often not considered early enough in the course of ventilation. Indications for extubation are even less clear, although a trial of spontaneous breathing would seem a prerequisite. Several indices have been developed in an attempt to predict weaning and extubation success but the available literature would suggest they offer no improvement over clinical judgment. Extubation failure rates range from 2% to 20% and bear little relationship to the duration of mechanical ventilation. Upper airway obstruction is the single most common cause of extubation failure. A reliable method of assessing readiness for weaning and predicting extubation success is not evident from the pediatric literature.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Early recognition and aggressive treatment of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has changed a uniformly fatal disease to one 55% survive. We examined the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric patients with HLH from the three largest academic medical centers in Texas for information on modern non-study treatment and survival. In contrast with previously reported series, the racial and ethnic composition of Texas provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of race and ethnicity on survival with HLH. PROCEDURE: A retrospective chart review of local oncology and pathology databases identified 70 patients with HLH from 1992 to 2007. Median age was 1.8 years (range 0.1-16.5 years) and 43% were Latino. RESULTS: We identified 70 patients with an overall survival of 67% after a median follow-up of 3 months (range 1-139 months). Twenty patients (29%) underwent stem cell transplant (SCT). Seven patients (18%) had mutations in the Perforin, Munc 13-4, or Syntaxin-11 genes, consistent with primary disease. Calculated cross-sectional prevalence of HLH in Texas from our study is 1 in 100,000 children. The effect of Latino ethnicity on survival was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: HLH is a rare but potentially treatable illness with modern aggressive therapy. Though treatment is more standardized for HLH, the role of race and ethnicity as risk factors for development of disease and impact on outcome may warrant further investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the sensitivity of plain radiographs in identifying bony or ligamentous cervical spine injury in children. METHODS: We identified a retrospective cohort of children younger than 16 years with blunt trauma-related bony or ligamentous cervical spine injury evaluated between 2000 and 2004 at 1 of 17 hospitals participating in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network. We excluded children who had a single or undocumented number of radiographic views or one of the following injuries types: isolated spinal cord injury, spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormalities, or atlantoaxial rotary subluxation. Using consensus methods, study investigators reviewed the radiology reports and assigned a classification (definite, possible, or no cervical spine injury) as well as film adequacy. A pediatric neurosurgeon, blinded to the classification of the radiology reports, reviewed complete case histories and assigned final cervical spine injury type. RESULTS: We identified 206 children who met inclusion criteria, of which 127 had definite and 41 had possible cervical spine injury identified by plain radiograph. Of the 186 children with adequate cervical spine radiographs, 168 had definite or possible cervical spine injury identified by plain radiograph for a sensitivity of 90% (95% confidence interval, 85%-94%). Cervical spine radiographs did not identify the following cervical spine injuries: fracture (15 children) and ligamentous injury alone (3 children). Nine children with normal cervical spine radiographs presented with 1 or more of the following: endotracheal intubation (4 children), altered mental status (5 children), or focal neurologic findings (5 children).

  Abstract                 = {AIM: 'Successful aging' in individuals with schizophrenia has been attracting attention. We examined two forward-looking factors of successful aging among schizophrenia patients: 'attitude toward aging' and 'preparing behavior for old age'. METHODS: Fifty-seven middle-aged and elderly schizophrenia patients with successful aging were identified using the Attitude toward Aging Scale, the Preparing Behavior for Old Age Scale, and assessments of their cognitive function, psychiatric symptoms, social functioning and quality of life. A multiple regression analysis was used to detect determinants of attitude toward aging/preparing behavior for old age at that time ('present': community dwelling). We also analyzed predictors of successful aging using demographic/clinical data assessed 3 years previously ('past': residential care). RESULTS: The multiple regression analysis revealed that quality of life was a significant determinant: a higher quality of life was related to a more positive attitude toward aging and less active preparing behavior. The significant predictors of preparing behavior were quality of life and the length of the hospital stay: a longer hospital stay and a higher quality of life were related to less active preparing behavior. CONCLUSION: Quality of life and the length of the hospital stay significantly contributed to forward-looking factors of successful aging. Avoiding long hospitalization periods for patients with schizophrenia may lead to more active preparing behavior, but the improvement of quality of life may not be a sufficient condition. As schizophrenia patients have an optimistic attitude and insufficient preparing behavior, support to prepare such individuals for old age is required as part of community-based psychiatric care strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: A clinical trial was conducted in healthy adult volunteers to assess the effect of levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and ciprofloxacin on the QT and QTc interval. METHODS: Electrocardiograms were recorded 24 hours before and after subjects took placebo, 1000 mg levofloxacin, 800 mg moxifloxacin, and 1500 mg ciprofloxacin in a double-blind, randomized, 4-period, 4-treatment, 4-sequence crossover trial. Changes in QT and QTc interval from baseline were assessed by several different methods. RESULTS: Increases in QT and QTc interval compared with placebo were consistently greater after moxifloxacin compared with either levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The mean postdose change from baseline QTc (Bazett) intervals for the 24-hour period after treatment with moxifloxacin ranged from 16.34 to 17.83 ms (P < .001, compared with placebo). For levofloxacin, this change ranged from 3.53 to 4.88 ms (P < .05, compared with placebo), and for ciprofloxacin, this change ranged from 2.27 to 4.93 ms (P < .05, compared with placebo, with the use of 3 of 5 baseline methods). CONCLUSIONS: A change in QTc (Bazett) interval from baseline can be demonstrated safely in healthy volunteers after single high doses of fluoroquinolones that achieve approximately 1.5 times the maximum plasma drug concentration that occurs after recommended doses. There is substantial daily variation in both QT and QTc interval, and the magnitude and frequency of changes in QTc interval can depend on the methods used. These factors need to be considered because clinical trials measuring the effects of drugs on QT intervals are used to estimate the risk of using these drugs. Greater changes in QT and QTc intervals after treatment with moxifloxacin compared with levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin are consistent with in vitro observations related to the effect of these drugs on rapid potassium (IK(r)) channels. The clinical relevance of these differences is not known.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECT Seizures may cause diagnostic confusion and be a source of metabolic stress after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children. The incidence of electroencephalography (EEG)-confirmed seizures and of subclinical seizures in the pediatric population with TBI is not well known. METHODS A routine protocol for continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring was initiated for all patients with moderate or severe TBI at a Level 1 pediatric trauma center. Over a 3.5-year period, all patients with TBI who underwent cEEG monitoring, both according to protocol and those with mild head injuries who underwent cEEG monitoring at the discretion of the treating team, were identified prospectively. Clinical data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Over the study period, 594 children were admitted with TBI, and 144 of these children underwent cEEG monitoring. One hundred two (71\%) of these 144 children had moderate or severe TBI. Abusive head trauma (AHT) was the most common mechanism of injury (65 patients, 45\%) in children with cEEG monitoring. Seizures were identified on cEEG in 43 patients (30\%). Forty (93\%) of these 43 patients had subclinical seizures, including 17 (40\%) with only subclinical seizures and 23 (53\%) with both clinical and subclinical seizures. Fifty-three percent of patients with seizures experienced status epilepticus. Age less than 2.4 years and AHT mechanism were strongly correlated with presence of seizures (odds ratios 8.7 and 6.0, respectively). Those patients with only subclinical seizures had the same risk factors as the other groups. The presence of seizures did not correlate with discharge disposition but was correlated with longer hospital stay and intensive care unit stay. CONCLUSIONS Continuous EEG monitoring identifies a significant number of subclinical seizures acutely after TBI. Children younger than 2.4 years of age and victims of AHT are particularly vulnerable to subclinical seizures, and seizures in general. Continuous EEG monitoring allows for accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of posttraumatic seizures, and may mitigate secondary injury to the traumatized brain.},

  Abstract                 = {To address the question of managing subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) in the older patient, the management and outcome of 199 consecutive patients aged > or = 60 years with a confirmed diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage (n = 186) or an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (n = 13) were reviewed. In seven patients, the cause of the SAH was an arterio-venous malformation and these were excluded from further analysis. Angiography was performed in 141 patients with a complication rate of 2.1%. Angiography was not performed in 51 patients and, in this cohort, the in-patient mortality rate was 68.6% and only 27.5% had a favourable outcome at discharge. Operation was not performed in 21 patients with demonstrated aneurysms for a variety of reasons. In this group, the in-patient mortality rate was 47.6% and 38.1% had a favourable outcome at discharge. Eighty-one patients in good neurological grade underwent surgery for a ruptured aneurysm and six patients underwent surgery for a symptomatic unruptured aneurysm. The surgical mortality was 1.1% and a favourable outcome at discharge was achieved in 83.9% of patients. Thirty-three patients were angiographic negative and there was a favourable outcome in 97% of this group. The management mortality in these selected patients admitted to the Department of Clinical Neurosciences was 24.4% and a favourable outcome was recorded in 66.2% of patients. Long-term follow-up (median 40 months, range 3-120 months) was obtained in 97% of discharged patients. The probability of survival at 60 months for patients in good condition at discharge was 0.826 (95% confidence interval 0.722-0.894).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The aim of the present study was to re-examine this finding against a background of more intensive monitoring and data acquisition. Eight severely head-injured patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less, whose admission CT scan did not show a mass lesion, midline shift, or effaced basal cisterns, underwent minute-to-minute recordings of arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) derived from blood pressure minus ICP. Intracranial hypertension (ICP > or = 20 mm Hg lasting longer than 5 minutes) was recorded in seven of the eight patients; in five cases the rise was pronounced in terms of both magnitude (ICP > or = 30 mm Hg) and duration. Reduced CPP (< or = 60 mm Hg lasting longer than 5 minutes) was recorded in five patients. Severely head-injured (comatose) patients whose initial CT scan is normal or does not show a mass lesion, midline shift, or abnormal cisterns nevertheless remain at substantial risk of developing significant secondary cerebral insults due to elevated ICP and reduced CPP. The authors recommend continuous ICP and blood pressure monitoring with derivation of CPP in all comatose head-injured patients.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) have grown in number and size over time in aggregate across the United States, but the factors promoting such changes have not been well characterized. This study was conducted to explore the establishment, expansion, and closure of PICUs. DESIGN: A cross-sectional in-depth telephone interview survey of executive hospital administrators. SETTING: Fourteen institutions representing four newly established PICUs, two PICU expansions, and eight PICU closures. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Officials' comments indicate that the establishment of PICUs is driven primarily by the need to care for patients requiring intensive cardiorespiratory monitoring and/or postoperative surgical care and to respond to the needs of outlying community hospitals. The main factors that drive PICU expansion are institutional growth in pediatric subspecialist medical and surgical support for critically ill patients and the need to match increases in demand and patient volume experienced by existing PICUs. With regard to PICU closures, competition from other institutions within the same market for patients and subspecialty care providers, lower-than-expected volumes of patients, and/or negative financial margins were cited as key factors. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insight into decision-making that influences the availability of critical care services for children. The establishment, expansion, and closure of PICUs are driven predominantly by local demand for pediatric critical care services, whereas availability of subspecialists as well as competition between PICUs within the same market affect the long-term sustainability of such services.},

Data included demographics, admission source, and outcomes. Admission source was classified as interhospital transfer from the emergency departments (ED), wards, or PICUs of referring hospitals; or from the study hospital ED (direct).Compared with direct admissions, inter-PICU transfers had higher crude mortality (odds ratio, 1.93; 95\% confidence interval, 1.31-2.84) but not significant mortality difference (odds ratio, 1.16; 95\% confidence interval, 0.71-1.86) after adjusting for illness severity, age, and sex. Conversely, ED transfers had lower PICU mortality than direct ED admissions. Children with transfer admissions stayed significantly longer and used more intensive care technology in the study PICU than children directly admitted (P < .01). In comparisons within quartiles of mortality risk, inter-PICU transfers had longer hospitalization and higher mortality in all but the highest quartile.Interhospital transfer, particularly inter-PICU transfer, was associated with significant hospital resource consumption that often correlated with admission illness severity. Future prospective studies should identify determinants of pretransfer illness severity and investigate decision making underlying interhospital transfer.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To describe and compare hospital resource use and in-hospital mortality among critically ill hospitalized children according to comorbid illness status. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of administrative data with generation of national estimates. SETTING: None. PATIENTS: Hospitalized children 0 to 18 yrs old with receipt of critical care services between 1997 and 2006. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 24,954 and 45,521 child hospitalizations with receipt of critical care services nationally in 1997 and 2006, respectively. In 1997, 35% of these hospitalizations had comorbid illnesses and 65% of these were in teaching hospitals. In 2006, 41% of critical care hospitalizations had comorbid illnesses, and 82% were in teaching hospitals. Cardiovascular diseases were the most common comorbid illnesses in 1997 (18%) and 2006 (22%). Mortality was significantly higher among patients with comorbid illness versus those without in 1997 (12.5% vs. 8.6%; p < .01) and in 2006 (10.8% vs. 7.8%; p < .01). Critically ill patients with comorbid illness vs. those without had significantly longer hospital stay in 1997 (30 days vs. 15 days; p < .01) and in 2006 (26 days vs. 14 days; p < .01). Corresponding charges were also significantly higher in the presence of comorbid illnesses vs. without, in 1997 ($131,203 vs. $62,070; p < .01) and in 2006 ($141,586 vs. $70,532; p < .01), expressed in 2006 U.S dollars. Across the 10-yr study period, hospital mortality was higher and hospital resource use greater among children with comorbid illness than children without. CONCLUSIONS: Among pediatric hospitalizations requiring use of critical care services, comorbid illness was associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality and significantly greater hospital resource use pattern predominantly occurring in teaching hospitals. Policymaking regarding child critical care service delivery should anticipate exacerbation of these trends in the future, which have implications for bed availability and the overall acuity level in critical care settings.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to describe patient and hospital characteristics associated with in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and charges for critically ill children with severe sepsis. METHODS: Our study consisted of a retrospective study of children 0 to 19 years of age hospitalized with severe sepsis using the 2003 Kids' Inpatient Database. We generated national estimates of rates of hospitalization and then compared in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and total charges according to patient and hospital characteristics using multivariable regression methods. Severity of illness was measured by using all-patient refined diagnosis-related group severity of illness classification into minor, moderate, major, and extreme severity. RESULTS: There were an estimated 21,448 hospitalizations for severe pediatric sepsis nationally in 2003. The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.2%. Comorbid illness was present in 34% of hospitalized children. Most (70%) of the extremely ill children were admitted to children's hospitals. Length of stay was longer among patients with higher illness severity and nonsurvivors compared with survivors (13.5 vs 8.5 days). Hospitalizations at urban or children's hospitals were also associated with longer length of stay than nonchildren's or rural hospitals, respectively. Higher charges were associated with higher illness severity, and nonsurvivors had 2.5-fold higher total charges than survivors. Also, higher charges were observed among hospitalizations in urban or children's hospitals. In multivariable regression analysis, multiple comorbid illnesses, multiple organ dysfunction, and greater severity of illness were associated with higher odds of mortality and longer length of stay. Higher hospital charges and longer length of stay were observed among transfer hospitalizations and among hospitalizations to children's hospitals and nonchildren's teaching hospitals compared with hospitals, which had neither children's nor teaching status. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality from severe pediatric sepsis is associated with patient illness severity, comorbid illness, and multiple organ dysfunction. Many characteristics are associated with resource consumption, including type of hospital, source of admission, and illness severity.},

Patients admitted by interhospital transfer had higher injury severity and lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores at admission (P < .01). Of 31 deaths during the study period, 26 (83.9\%) were among patients admitted by interhospital transfer. These patients had a 7-fold higher unadjusted incident rate of death (incidence rate ratio, 7.16; 95\% confidence interval, 2.49-20.58) compared with those admitted directly. This finding remained (incidence rate ratio, 3.01; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01-8.98) after adjustment for injury severity and Glasgow Coma Scale scores, elapsed time from injury until admission at the trauma center, and age. Among survivors, patients admitted by interhospital transfer stayed longer in the hospital than those admitted directly.Pediatric trauma center mortality rates are lower among children admitted directly from the injury scene compared with those admitted by interhospital transfer.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the characteristics, resource utilization, and outcomes for transfer admissions from level II to level I pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: A 16-bed level I PICU in a tertiary care children's hospital. PATIENTS: All transfer admissions from level II PICUs from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2003; admissions for cardiac surgery were excluded. Patient characteristics, resource utilization, and outcomes were described and then compared across predefined strata (low <5%, moderate 5-30%, and high >30%) of predicted probability of death. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 168 transfer admissions, 45%, 30%, and 25% were in the low, moderate, and high mortality risk groups, respectively. Length of stay at the referring PICU was shortest for the high-risk admissions. The most frequent diagnoses among all risk groups were respiratory failure (49%) and sepsis (14%). High-risk admissions were more likely to receive advanced therapies such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (41.5% high risk vs. 39.2% moderate vs. 6.6% low risk, p < .01) and renal replacement therapy (34.2% vs. 17.7% vs. 2.6%, p < .01). The high-risk admissions had longer PICU length of stay and the highest death rates (34% vs. 10% vs. 4%, p < .01) when compared with the moderate- and low-risk admissions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights significant differences in patient characteristics, resource utilization, and outcomes across mortality risk-stratified groups of critically ill and injured children transferred from level II to level I PICU care. Further studies are warranted to investigate decision making that prompt inter-PICU transfers.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to describe patient and hospital characteristics associated with the use of intracranial pressure monitors and outcomes in critically ill children with meningitis. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of children 0 to 17 years of age hospitalized with meningitis and requiring mechanical ventilation using the 1997 and 2000 Kids' Inpatient Database. We generated national estimates of rates of intracranial pressure monitoring and in-hospital mortality by patient and hospital characteristics, and compared in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay, and total charges for children who received an intracranial pressure monitor with those who did not. RESULTS: There were an estimated 1067 and 1170 hospitalizations nationally for childhood meningitis requiring mechanical ventilation in 1997 and 2000, respectively. Most (79%) of the hospitalizations involved infants. Overall, intracranial-pressure monitors were used in 7% of hospitalizations for meningitis, with the highest rates in children aged 5 to 17 years and lowest rates in children <1 year. In-hospital mortality was 19.6%, highest in children aged 5 to 17 years and in children with pneumococcal infections. In multivariate regression analyses, intracranial pressure monitor use was positively associated with age, patient volume, and hospitals located in the West census region. In-hospital mortality was associated with increasing age, hospitalization in the year 2000, self-pay/other insurance status, and pneumococcal meningitis. There was no difference in hospital mortality associated with use of intracranial pressure monitors, but both length of stay and log-transformed total hospital charges were significantly higher in the group that received an intracranial-pressure monitor. CONCLUSION: Intracranial pressure monitoring for the treatment of critically ill children with meningitis varies by census region, the number of cases treated, and patient age. The use of intracranial pressure monitoring was not statistically associated with mortality in this national sample.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The Norwood procedure with a modified Blalock-Taussig (MBT) shunt, the first palliative stage for single-ventricle lesions with systemic outflow obstruction, is associated with high mortality. The right ventricle-pulmonary artery (RVPA) shunt may improve coronary flow but requires a ventriculotomy. We compared the two shunts in infants with hypoplastic heart syndrome or related anomalies. METHODS: Infants undergoing the Norwood procedure were randomly assigned to the MBT shunt (275 infants) or the RVPA shunt (274 infants) at 15 North American centers. The primary outcome was death or cardiac transplantation 12 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes included unintended cardiovascular interventions and right ventricular size and function at 14 months and transplantation-free survival until the last subject reached 14 months of age. RESULTS: Transplantation-free survival 12 months after randomization was higher with the RVPA shunt than with the MBT shunt (74% vs. 64%, P=0.01). However, the RVPA shunt group had more unintended interventions (P=0.003) and complications (P=0.002). Right ventricular size and function at the age of 14 months and the rate of nonfatal serious adverse events at the age of 12 months were similar in the two groups. Data collected over a mean (+/-SD) follow-up period of 32+/-11 months showed a nonsignificant difference in transplantation-free survival between the two groups (P=0.06). On nonproportional-hazards analysis, the size of the treatment effect differed before and after 12 months (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In children undergoing the Norwood procedure, transplantation-free survival at 12 months was better with the RVPA shunt than with the MBT shunt. After 12 months, available data showed no significant difference in transplantation-free survival between the two groups. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00115934.)},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: A recently identified promoter polymorphism of the endotoxin receptor (CD14 C-159T) was shown to be associated with atherosclerotic diseases such as myocardial infarction. This study was conducted to determine whether this polymorphism is associated with decreased kidney function. METHODS: A total of 281 male and 522 female health check-up examinees, aged 39-88 years, were genotyped for CD14 C-159T. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation. Estimated GFR (eGFR) and the proportion of subjects with mildly decreased eGFR (eGFR under 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) were compared among the genotypes. RESULTS: Subjects carrying the T allele showed decreased age- and sex-adjusted eGFR compared with those with CC genotype (101+/-22 vs. 105+/-23 mL/min/1.73 m(2); mean+/-SD, p = 0.012). The proportion of subjects with mildly decreased eGFR was higher in T allele carriers (34.2% for TT+CT and 26.3% for CC genotype, p = 0.041), but not statistically significant when adjusted for age and sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.41, 95% CI 0.97-2.05, p = 0.076). In subjects under 65 years, T allele carriers had a significantly increased risk for mildly decreased eGFR (27.1% for TT+CT and 18.0% for CC; age- and sex-adjusted OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.06-3.12, p = 0.030). CONCLUSION: CD14-159T allele was associated with decreased eGFR compared with CC genotype, and with a higher prevalence of mildly decreased eGFR in younger subjects under 65.},

  Abstract                 = {Reliable diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health need. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is expressed in the central nervous system, and breakdown products (GFAP-BDP) are released following parenchymal brain injury. Here, we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of elevated levels of plasma GFAP-BDP in TBI. Participants were identified as part of the prospective Transforming Research And Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Study. Acute plasma samples (<24 h post-injury) were collected from patients presenting with brain injury who had CT imaging. The ability of GFAP-BDP level to discriminate patients with demonstrable traumatic lesions on CT, and with failure to return to pre-injury baseline at 6 months, was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Of the 215 patients included for analysis, 83% had mild, 4% had moderate, and 13% had severe TBI; 54% had acute traumatic lesions on CT. The ability of GFAP-BDP level to discriminate patients with traumatic lesions on CT as evaluated by AUC was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.93). The optimal cutoff of 0.68 ng/mL for plasma GFAP-BDP level was associated with a 21.61 odds ratio for traumatic findings on head CT. Discriminatory ability of unfavorable 6 month outcome was lower, AUC 0.65 (95% CI, 0.55-0.74), with a 2.07 odds ratio. GFAP-BDP levels reliably distinguish the presence and severity of CT scan findings in TBI patients. Although these findings confirm and extend prior studies, a larger prospective trial is still needed to validate the use of GFAP-BDP as a routine diagnostic biomarker for patient care and clinical research. The term "mild" continues to be a misnomer for this patient population, and underscores the need for evolving classification strategies for TBI targeted therapy.

DESIGN: We analyzed data from the 2002 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a nationally representative data set of hospital discharges. We performed a case-mix-adjusted, sample-weighted regression analysis as well as descriptive statistics of hospital use among adults with childhood-onset chronic disease. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: We identified hospitalizations for persons aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of complex congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, or spina bifida. Main Exposure Childhood chronic illness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Length of stay and total charges among pediatric, adult, and mixed hospitals. RESULTS: In multivariate adjusted analyses, patients with complex congenital heart disease and cystic fibrosis had a significantly longer length of stay in pediatric hospitals than in adult or mixed hospitals (P<.001); no similar difference was found for sickle cell disease and spina bifida. For all of the 4 conditions, hospital charges were significantly greater in pediatric hospitals than in adult or mixed hospitals (P<.001 for cystic fibrosis, complex congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease, and P<.01 for spina bifida). CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of persons who have survived to adulthood with complex congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, or sickle cell disease are hospitalized in hospitals that predominantly care for adults, where charges for care appear to be lower than in pediatric hospitals.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: The ACCM/PALS guidelines address early correction of paediatric septic shock using conventional measures. In the evolution of these recommendations, indirect measures of the balance between systemic oxygen delivery and demands using central venous or superior vena cava oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)[Symbol: see text]>/=[Symbol: see text]70%) in a goal-directed approach have been added. However, while these additional goal-directed endpoints are based on evidence-based adult studies, the extrapolation to the paediatric patient remains unvalidated. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare treatment according to ACCM/PALS guidelines, performed with and without ScvO(2) goal-directed therapy, on the morbidity and mortality rate of children with severe sepsis and septic shock. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Children and adolescents with severe sepsis or fluid-refractory septic shock were randomly assigned to ACCM/PALS with or without ScvO(2) goal-directed resuscitation. MEASUREMENTS: Twenty-eight-day mortality was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: Of the 102 enrolled patients, 51 received ACCM/PALS with ScvO(2) goal-directed therapy and 51 received ACCM/PALS without ScvO(2) goal-directed therapy. ScvO(2) goal-directed therapy resulted in less mortality (28-day mortality 11.8% vs. 39.2%, p[Symbol: see text]=[Symbol: see text]0.002), and fewer new organ dysfunctions (p[Symbol: see text]=[Symbol: see text]0.03). ScvO(2) goal-directed therapy resulted in more crystalloid (28 (20-40) vs. 5 (0-20)[Symbol: see text]ml/kg, p[Symbol: see text]<[Symbol: see text]0.0001), blood transfusion (45.1% vs. 15.7%, p[Symbol: see text]=[Symbol: see text]0.002) and inotropic (29.4% vs. 7.8%, p[Symbol: see text]=[Symbol: see text]0.01) support in the first 6[Symbol: see text]h.

METHODS: Hospital inpatient uniform bills (UB-92) for 122 patients with clinically documented severe sepsis of presumed infectious origin were retrospectively examined. Final UB-92 hospital bills were obtained for all study subjects. ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes from these bills were then reviewed to ascertain the number of subjects for whom one or more diagnostic codes for septicemia and/or bacteremia were present. RESULTS: A total of 92 hospital bills (75.4%) contained one or more ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes for septicemia and/or bacteremia. Of the 30 that did not, 15 (12.3%) had codes for major systemic infection and organ failure. No diagnoses indicative of sepsis (i.e., organ failure and major infection) were present on the remaining 15 (12.3%) bills. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that use of ICD-9-CM codes for identifying patients with sepsis using hospital bills is only moderately sensitive. Strict reliance on administrative data sources for sepsis surveillance or research planning may therefore be prone to substantial error.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between driver restraint use and child emergency department (ED) evaluation following a motor vehicle crash (MVC). METHODS: This cohort study included child passengers aged 0-12 years riding with an adult driver aged 21 years or older involved in a MVC in Utah from 1999 to 2004. The 6 years of Utah MVC records were probabilistically linked to statewide Utah ED records. We estimated the relative risk of ED evaluation following a MVC for children riding with restrained versus unrestrained drivers. Generalized estimating equations were used to calculate relative risks adjusted for child, driver, and crash characteristics. RESULTS: Six percent (6%) of children riding with restrained adult drivers were evaluated in the ED compared to twenty-two percent (22%) of children riding with unrestrained adult drivers following a MVC (relative risk 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.32). After adjusting for child, vehicle, and crash characteristics, the relative risk of child ED evaluation associated with driver restraint remained significant (relative risk 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.72-0.94). Driver restraint use was associated with child restraint use, less alcohol/drug involvement, and lower relative risk of severe collision types (head-on, rollover). CONCLUSIONS: Driver seat belt use is associated with decreased risk of ED evaluation for child passengers in the event of a MVC.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Geographic access to NCI-Cancer Centers varies by region, race/ethnicity, and place of residence, but utilization of these specialized centers has not been examined at the national level in the U.S. This study identified determinants of NCI-Cancer Center attendance in Medicare cancer patients. METHODS: SEER-Medicare (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) data were used to identify individuals with an incident cancer of the breast, lung, colon/rectum, or prostate from 1998-2002. NCI-Cancer Center attendance was determined based on utilization claims from 1998-2003. Demographic, clinical, and geographic factors were examined in multilevel models. We performed sensitivity analyses for the NCI-Cancer Center attendance definition. RESULTS: Overall, 7.3% of this SEER-Medicare cohort (N = 211,048) attended an NCI-Cancer Center. Travel-time to the nearest NCI-Cancer Center was inversely related to attendance, showing 11% decreased likelihood of attendance for every 10 minutes of additional travel-time (OR = 0.89, 95%CI 0.88-0.90). Receiving predominantly generalist care prior to diagnosis was associated with a lower likelihood of attendance (OR = 0.79, 95%CI 0.77-0.82). The other factors associated with greater NCI-Cancer attendance were later stage at diagnosis, fewer comorbidities, and urban residence in conjunction with African-American race. CONCLUSIONS: Attendance at NCI-Cancer Centers is low among Medicare beneficiaries, but is strongly influenced by proximity and general provider care prior to diagnosis. Other patient factors are predictive of NCI-Cancer Center attendance and may be important in better understanding cancer care utilization.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Although access to cancer care is known to influence patient outcomes, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding geographic access to cancer care, and how it may vary by population characteristics. This study estimated travel time to specialized cancer care settings for the continental U.S. population and calculated per capita oncologist supply. METHODS: The closest travel times were estimated using a network analysis of the road distance weighted by travel speeds from the population or geographic centroid of every ZIP area in the continental U.S. to that of the nearest cancer care setting under consideration: National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Centers, academic medical centers, and oncologists. Alaska and Hawaii were excluded because travel in these states is often not road-based. Population and geographic characteristics including race/ethnicity, income, education, and region were derived from U.S. Census 2000 data and from rural-urban commuting area classifications. Oncologist supply per 100,000 residents in Hospital Referral Regions (pHRRs) was estimated by region. RESULTS: Travel times of <or=1 hour were estimated for 45.2% of the population to the nearest NCI Cancer Center, 69.4% to the nearest academic-based care, and 91.8% to any specialized cancer care. Native Americans, nonurban dwellers, and residents in the South had the longest travel times to the nearest NCI Cancer Center compared with the overall U.S. population (median [interquartile range (IQR)] in minutes: 155 [62-308], 173 [111-257], and 164 [70-272], vs 78 [27-172], respectively). Travel burdens persisted for Native Americans and nonurban populations across all 3 cancer care settings. For all population strata, travel times markedly increased as the degree of cancer care specialization increased. The median oncologist supply for pHRRs was 2.83 per 100,000 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: There are population groups with limited access to the most specialized cancer care settings.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine the type and outcome of early post-traumatic seizures in children and the factors associated with it.A prospective observational study on all consecutive children with head injuries at the General Hospital Kuala Lumpur between November 1993 and December 1994. The onset, type and frequency of seizures occurring within the first week of injury were documented. Using inpatients as a cohort, logistic regression analysis was used to determine clinical and radiological variables significantly associated with seizures. The outcome 6 months post-injury was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.Fifty-three of 966 children (5.5\%) developed seizures within the first week of trauma. Seven (13.2\%) occurred within 1 h of injury, 30 (56.6\%) between 1 and 24 h and 16 (30.2\%) after 24 h. Factors significantly associated with early post-traumatic seizures were female sex, age less than 2 years, loss of consciousness for more than 24h and acute subdural haematoma (P<0.01). Children with seizures had a poorer outcome (death or severe disability) than inpatients without seizures (21/53 vs 19/182, P<0.001). The outcome was worst in children with recurrent partial seizures, who had a longer injury-seizure interval and were more likely to have focal neurologic deficits compared to those with sporadic or generalized seizures.Anticonvulsant prophylaxis to minimize the adverse effects of early seizures in head injury should be considered for young children (less than 2 years old) with subdural haematoma and a prolonged duration of coma. Prompt and effective control of recurrent seizures is recommended.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: There is controversy about which children with minor head injury need to undergo computed tomography (CT). We aimed to develop a highly sensitive clinical decision rule for the use of CT in children with minor head injury. METHODS: For this multicentre cohort study, we enrolled consecutive children with blunt head trauma presenting with a score of 13-15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale and loss of consciousness, amnesia, disorientation, persistent vomiting or irritability. For each child, staff in the emergency department completed a standardized assessment form before any CT. The main outcomes were need for neurologic intervention and presence of brain injury as determined by CT. We developed a decision rule by using recursive partitioning to combine variables that were both reliable and strongly associated with the outcome measures and thus to find the best combinations of predictor variables that were highly sensitive for detecting the outcome measures with maximal specificity. RESULTS: Among the 3866 patients enrolled (mean age 9.2 years), 95 (2.5%) had a score of 13 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, 282 (7.3%) had a score of 14, and 3489 (90.2%) had a score of 15. CT revealed that 159 (4.1%) had a brain injury, and 24 (0.6%) underwent neurologic intervention. We derived a decision rule for CT of the head consisting of four high-risk factors (failure to reach score of 15 on the Glasgow coma scale within two hours, suspicion of open skull fracture, worsening headache and irritability) and three additional medium-risk factors (large, boggy hematoma of the scalp; signs of basal skull fracture; dangerous mechanism of injury). The high-risk factors were 100.0% sensitive (95% CI 86.2%-100.0%) for predicting the need for neurologic intervention and would require that 30.2% of patients undergo CT. The medium-risk factors resulted in 98.1% sensitivity (95% CI 94.6%-99.4%) for the prediction of brain injury by CT and would require that 52.0% of patients undergo CT. INTERPRETATION: The decision rule developed in this study identifies children at two levels of risk. Once the decision rule has been prospectively validated, it has the potential to standardize and improve the use of CT for children with minor head injury.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between resource utilization and postoperative length of stay (PLOS) following congenital heart disease surgery is unknown. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. We included subjects 1 month to 1 year of age with a PLOS of </=1 month following elective, complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) during 2004-2008 at children's hospitals that performed >/=10 such surgeries during the study period. We constructed three generalized linear models to assess the relationships of total costs, laboratory costs, and imaging costs during the first three postoperative days with overall PLOS. Race/ethnicity, insurance type, sex, and presence of a genetic syndrome (by ICD-9 codes) were included in the models as fixed effects; hospital of surgery was included as a random effect. RESULTS: For 1161 eligible surgical encounters at 36 children's hospitals, mean PLOS was 7.1 days (median = 6 days). Mean total, laboratory, and imaging costs for the first three postoperative days were $26 455, $2941, and $813, respectively. Most subjects were male (58.9%), did not have a genetic syndrome (88.3%), were non-Hispanic white (58.3%), and had either public or private insurance (41.0% and 39.1%, respectively). An estimated increase in total costs of $4600 or laboratory costs of $700 in the first three postoperative days was associated with a 1-day increase in PLOS. Imaging costs were not associated with PLOS. CONCLUSIONS: Increased resource utilization is not associated with a shorter PLOS following elective TOF repair, and it may be associated with longer PLOS.},

Research is needed to determine the rates and factors related to readmission in this patient population.To determine 30-day readmission rates and factors related to readmission for patients receiving postacute inpatient rehabilitation.Retrospective cohort study of records for 736,536 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries (mean age, 78.0 [SD, 7.3] years) discharged from 1365 inpatient rehabilitation facilities to the community in 2006 through 2011. Sixty-three percent of patients were women, and 85.1\% were non-Hispanic white.Thirty-day readmission rates for the 6 largest diagnostic impairment categories receiving inpatient rehabilitation. These included stroke, lower extremity fracture, lower extremity joint replacement, debility, neurologic disorders, and brain dysfunction.Mean rehabilitation length of stay was 12.4 (SD, 5.3) days. The overall 30-day readmission rate was 11.8\% (95\% CI, 11.7\%-11.8\%). Rates ranged from 5.8\% (95\% CI, 5.8\%-5.9\%) for patients with lower extremity joint replacement to 18.8\% (95\% CI, 18.8\%-18.9\%). for patients with debility. Rates were highest in men (13.0\% [ 95\% CI, 12.8\%-13.1\%], vs 11.0\% [95\% CI, 11.0\%-11.1\%] in women), non-Hispanic blacks (13.8\% [95\% CI, 13.5\%-14.1\%], vs 11.5\% [95\% CI, 11.5\%-11.6\%] in whites, 12.5\% [95\% CI, 12.1\%-12.8\%] in Hispanics, and 11.9\% [95\% CI, 11.4\%-12.4\%] in other races/ethnicities), beneficiaries with dual eligibility (15.1\% [95\% CI, 14.9\%-15.4\%], vs 11.1\% [95\% CI, 11.0\%-11.2\%] for no dual eligibility), and in patients with tier 1 comorbidities (25.6\% [95\% CI, 24.9\%-26.3\%], vs 18.9\% [95\% CI, 18.5\%-19.3\%] for tier 2, 15.1\% [95\% CI, 14.9\%-15.3\%] for tier 3, and 9.9\% [95\% CI, 9.9\%-10.0\%] for no tier comorbidities). Higher motor and cognitive functional status were associated with lower hospital readmission rates across the 6 impairment categories. Adjusted readmission rates by state ranged from 9.2\% to 13.6\%. Approximately 50\% of patients rehospitalized within the 30-day period were readmitted within 11 days of discharge. Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Group codes for heart failure, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, septicemia, nutritional and metabolic disorders, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, and digestive disorders were common reasons for readmission.Among postacute rehabilitation facilities providing services to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, 30-day readmission rates ranged from 5.8\% to 18.8\% for selected impairment groups. Further research is needed to understand the causes of readmission.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was suggested to play a role in endothelial dysfunction that is associated with a number of cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized that PARP may play an important role in atherogenesis and that its inhibition may attenuate atherosclerotic plaque development in an experimental model of atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a mouse (apolipoprotein E [ApoE](-/-)) model of high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis, we demonstrate an association between cell death and oxidative stress-associated DNA damage and PARP activation within atherosclerotic plaques. PARP inhibition by thieno[2,3-c]isoquinolin-5-one reduced plaque number and size and altered structural composition of plaques in these animals without affecting sera lipid contents. These results were corroborated genetically with the use of ApoE(-/-) mice that are heterozygous for PARP-1. PARP inhibition promoted an increase in collagen content, potentially through an increase in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, and transmigration of smooth muscle cells to intima of atherosclerotic plaques as well as a decrease in monocyte chemotactic protein-1 production, all of which are markers of plaque stability. In PARP-1(-/-) macrophages, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression was severely inhibited because of a defective nuclear factor-kappaB nuclear translocation in response to lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, PARP-1 gene deletion not only conferred protection to foam cells against H2O2-induced death but also switched the mode of death from necrosis to apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that PARP inhibition interferes with plaque development and may promote plaque stability, possibly through a reduction in inflammatory factors and cellular changes related to plaque dynamics. PARP inhibition may prove beneficial for the treatment of atherosclerosis.},

METHODS: The study is based on a retrospective review of 204 pediatric patients with 300 inguinal hernias treated with the SEAL technique from November 2001 to August 2003 at a tertiary referral center. Patient age ranged from 30 days to 16 years at the time of operation, with a mean follow-up of 235 days (median follow-up, 189 days). Statistical analysis was done with chi2 test, with the main outcome measures being intraoperative and postoperative complications including recurrence rate, suture abscesses, and postoperative hydroceles. RESULTS: There were 13 recurrences in 300 SEAL repairs, for a recurrence rate of 4.3% (95% C.I. 2.01%-6.65%), with only two recurrences in the last 100 repairs (2%). There were 10 suture abscesses or granulomas and 7 postoperative hydroceles. There was no statistically significant association between recurrence and gender, age at operation, history of prematurity, bilaterality, or kind of suture used. CONCLUSIONS: Our 4.3% (95% C.I. 2.01-6.65%) recurrence rate is comparable to prior series of laparoscopic repairs citing recurrence rates of 0%-5.7%. The majority of recurrences occurred within the first 4 months of developing this new procedure, with only two recurrences in the last 100 repairs. These pilot data suggest that SEAL is a safe and effective technique for inguinal hernia repair in the pediatric population. A prospective study is planned to compare this laparoscopic technique with open herniorrhaphy.},

  Abstract                 = {Simulated exposure therapy for spider phobia served as a clinically naturalistic model to study effects of sleep on extinction. Spider-fearing, young adult women (N = 66), instrumented for skin conductance response (SCR), heart rate acceleration (HRA) and corrugator electromyography (EMG), viewed 14 identical 1-min videos of a behaving spider before a 12-hr delay containing a normal night's Sleep (N = 20) or continuous daytime Wake (N = 23), or a 2-hr delay of continuous wake in the Morning (N = 11) or Evening (N = 12). Following the delay, all groups viewed this same video 6 times followed by six 1-min videos of a novel spider. After each video, participants rated disgust, fearfulness and unpleasantness. In all 4 groups, all measures except corrugator EMG diminished across Session 1 (extinction learning) and, excepting SCR to a sudden noise, increased from the old to novel spider in Session 2. In Wake only, summed subjective ratings and SCR to the old spider significantly increased across the delay (extinction loss) and were greater for the novel vs. the old spider when it was equally novel at the beginning of Session 1 (sensitization). In Sleep only, SCR to a sudden noise decreased across the inter-session delay (extinction augmentation) and, along with HRA, was lower to the novel spider than initially to the old spider in Session 1 (extinction generalization). None of the above differentiated Morning and Evening groups suggesting that intervening sleep, rather than time-of-testing, produced differences between Sleep and Wake. Thus, sleep following exposure therapy may promote retention and generalization of extinction learning.},

Nearly 51,000 patients have received extracorporeal life support (ECLS). Of the patients, 50% (>25,000) were neonatal respiratory failure, with a 75% overall survival to discharge or transfer. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia remains a major use of ECLS in this population with 51% survival. Extracorporeal life support use for pediatric respiratory failure has nearly doubled since 2000, with approximately 350 patients treated per year in the past 3 years examined (56% survival). Previously stable at about 100 cases a year for a decade, adult respiratory failure ECLS cases increased dramatically in 2009 with the H1N1 influenza pandemic and publication of the Conventional ventilation or ECMO for Severe Adult Respiratory failure (CESAR) trial results and have remained at approximately 400 cases a year through 2011 (55% survival). Use of ECLS for cardiac support represents a large area of consistent growth. Approximately 13,000 patients have been treated with survival to discharge rates of 40%, 49%, and 39% for neonates, pediatric, and adults, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To compare a decision rule with clinician judgment for identifying children at risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI) after blunt head trauma. METHODS: We performed an observational study of children with blunt head trauma. Emergency department physicians documented suspicion for TBI before cranial computed tomography (CT), rating suspicion as very low, low, intermediate, or high. Our outcome variable was TBI on CT. We compared clinician judgment (very low vs. higher suspicion) for TBI on CT with a decision rule derived from the same database. RESULTS: Of 1865 children enrolled for whom physician suspicion was recorded, 1168 (62.6%) underwent CT and comprised the study population. Eighty-nine (7.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.2% to 9.3%) of the 1168 had TBIs on CT. The decision rule had a sensitivity of 88 (98.9%) of 89 versus 84 (94.4%) of 89 for clinician judgment (difference, 4.5%; 95% CI, -0.9% to 9.9%). The specificity of the decision rule was 288 (26.7%) of 1079 versus 329 (30.5%) 1079 for clinician judgment (difference, 3.8%; 95% CI, 0.5% to 7.1%). Application of the decision rule to the study population would have resulted in 289 (24.7%) fewer CT scans, although missing 1 child with a TBI (who was discharged home from the emergency department). CONCLUSIONS: A decision rule trended toward greater sensitivity than clinician judgment for identifying children with TBI on CT after blunt head trauma but was less specific. Because decisions to order cranial CT did not strictly follow clinician judgment, however, use of the decision rule would have resulted in less frequent use of CT.},

The results clearly show that the disabled population are more prone to hospitalization, and spend more on inpatient stays and pharmaceuticals. Households with disabled members are at greater risk of catastrophic health expenditures and debt financing, posing a serious threat to economic welfare.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability of emergency care research (ECR) to produce meaningful improvements in the outcomes of acutely ill or injured patients depends on the optimal configuration, infrastructure, organization, and support of emergency care research networks (ECRNs). Through the experiences of existing ECRNs, we can learn how to best accomplish this. A meeting was organized in Washington, DC, on May 28, 2008, to discuss the present state and future directions of clinical research networks as they relate to emergency care. Prior to the conference, at the time of online registration, participants responded to a series of preconference questions addressing the relevant issues that would form the basis of the breakout session discussions. During the conference, representatives from a number of existing ECRNs participated in discussions with the attendees and provided a description of their respective networks, infrastructure, and challenges. Breakout sessions provided the opportunity to further discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these networks and patterns of success with respect to their formation, management, funding, best practices, and pitfalls. Discussions centered on identifying characteristics that promote or inhibit successful networks and their interactivity, productivity, and expansion. Here the authors describe the current state of ECRNs and identify the strengths, weaknesses, and potential pitfalls of research networks. The most commonly cited strengths of population- or disease-based research networks identified in the preconference survey were access to larger numbers of patients; involvement of physician experts in the field, contributing to high-level study content; and the collaboration among investigators. The most commonly cited weaknesses were studies with too narrow a focus and restrictive inclusion criteria, a vast organizational structure with a risk of either too much or too little central organization or control, and heterogeneity of institutional policies and procedures among sites. Through the survey and structured discussion process involving multiple stakeholders, the authors have identified strengths and weaknesses that are consistent across a number of existing ECRNs. By leveraging the strengths and addressing the weaknesses, strategies can be adopted to enhance the scientific value and productivity of these networks and give direction to future ECRNs.},

DESIGN AND METHODS: The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. Pediatric representatives attended the various section meetings and workshops to contrast adult and pediatric management. These are published here as pediatric considerations. CONCLUSION: Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity, more difficult intravenous access, fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40-60 mL kg or higher needed, decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile, greater use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints, the unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock, and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control.},

The accuracy of this classification system for patients undergoing CHS is unclear.We performed a retrospective cohort study of all 14,098 patients 0 to 5 years of age undergoing any of six selected congenital heart operations, ranging in complexity from isolated closure of a ventricular septal defect to single-ventricle palliation, at 40 tertiary-care pediatric centers in the Pediatric Health Information Systems database between 2007 and 2010. Assigned APR-DRGs (cardiac versus noncardiac) were compared using χ2 or Fisher's exact tests between those patients admitted during the first day of life versus later and between those receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support versus those not. Recursive partitioning was used to assess the greatest determinants of APR-DRG type in the model.Every patient admitted on day 1 of life was assigned to a noncardiac APR-DRG (p<0.001 for each procedure). Similarly, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was highly associated with misclassification of CHS patients into a noncardiac APR-DRG (p<0.001 for each procedure). Cases misclassified into a noncardiac APR-DRG experienced a significantly increased mortality (p<0.001).In classifying patients undergoing CHS, APR-DRG coding has systematic misclassifications, which may result in inaccurate reporting of CHS case volumes and mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and laboratory features of macrophage activation syndrome as a complication of juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Cases of juvenile SLE-associated macrophage activation syndrome were provided by investigators belonging to 3 pediatric rheumatology networks or were found in the literature. Patients who had evidence of macrophage hemophagocytosis on bone marrow aspiration were considered to have definite macrophage activation syndrome, and those who did not have such evidence were considered to have probable macrophage activation syndrome. Clinical and laboratory findings in patients with macrophage activation syndrome were contrasted with those of 2 control groups composed of patients with active juvenile SLE without macrophage activation syndrome. The ability of each feature to discriminate macrophage activation syndrome from active disease was evaluated by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: The study included 38 patients (20 with definite macrophage activation syndrome and 18 with probable macrophage activation syndrome). Patients with definite and probable macrophage activation syndrome were comparable with regard to all clinical and laboratory features of the syndrome, except for a greater frequency of lymphadenopathy, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia in patients with definite macrophage activation syndrome. Overall, clinical features had better specificity than sensitivity, except for fever, which was highly sensitive but had low specificity. Among laboratory features, the best sensitivity and specificity was achieved using hyperferritinemia, followed by increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypofibrinogenemia. Based on the results of statistical analysis, preliminary diagnostic guidelines for macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile SLE were developed. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the occurrence of unexplained fever and cytopenia, when associated with hyperferritinemia, in a patient with juvenile SLE should raise the suspicion of macrophage activation syndrome. We propose preliminary guidelines for this syndrome in juvenile SLE to facilitate timely diagnosis and correct classification of patients.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Compression bandages appear to be simple medical devices. However, there is a lack of agreement over their classification and confusion over the use of important terms such as elastic, inelastic, and stiffness. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to propose terms to describe both simple and complex compression bandage systems and to offer classification based on in vivo measurements of subbandage pressure and stiffness. METHODS: A consensus meeting of experts including members from medical professions and from companies producing compression products discussed a proposal that was sent out beforehand and agreed on by the authors after correction. RESULTS: Pressure, layers, components, and elastic properties (P-LA-C-E) are the important characteristics of compression bandages. Based on simple in vivo measurements, pressure ranges and elastic properties of different bandage systems can be described. Descriptions of composite bandages should also report the number of layers of bandage material applied to the leg and the components that have been used to create the final bandage system. CONCLUSION: Future descriptions of compression bandages should include the subbandage pressure range measured in the medial gaiter area, the number of layers, and a specification of the bandage components and of the elastic property (stiffness) of the final bandage.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Aprotinin was used frequently in children undergoing congenital heart operations with the aim of reducing bleeding, until it was taken off the market after adult studies reported increased renal failure and death. We evaluated the safety of aprotinin in a large multicenter cohort of children undergoing congenital heart operations. METHODS: The Pediatric Health Information Systems Database was used to evaluate aprotinin in children (aged 0 to 18 years) undergoing congenital heart operations at 35 children's hospitals from 2003 to 2007. Propensity scores were constructed to account for potential confounders of age, sex, race, prematurity, genetic syndrome, type of operation (Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 category), center, and center volume. Multivariable analysis, adjusting for propensity score and individual covariates was performed to evaluate in-hospital mortality, postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis, and length of stay. Subanalysis was performed in the high-risk cohort undergoing reoperation. RESULTS: The study included 30,372 patients (56% male) who were a median age of 7 months (interquartile range, 36 days to 3.2 years). Overall, 44% received aprotinin. Multivariable analysis found no difference in postoperative mortality (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99 to 1.01), dialysis (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.01), or length of stay (least square mean difference, -0.44 days; 95% CI, -1.01 to 0.13) between aprotinin recipients and nonrecipients. No difference was found in mortality or dialysis in patients undergoing reoperation. Aprotinin recipients in the reoperation subgroup had significantly reduced length of stay (least square mean difference, -2.05 days; 95% CI -3.29 to -0.81), CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest aprotinin is not associated with increased mortality or dialysis in children undergoing congenital heart operations and that further evaluation of aprotinin in this population could be undertaken without undue risk.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Children undergoing congenital heart surgery often receive corticosteroids with the aim of reducing the inflammatory response after cardiopulmonary bypass; however, the value of this approach is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Pediatric Health Information Systems Database was used to evaluate outcomes associated with corticosteroids in children (0 to 18 years of age) undergoing congenital heart surgery at 38 US centers from 2003 to 2008. Propensity scores were constructed to account for potential confounders: age, sex, race, prematurity, genetic syndrome, type of surgery (Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery [RACHS-1] category), center, and center volume. Multivariable analysis, adjusting for propensity score and individual covariates, was performed to evaluate in-hospital mortality, postoperative length of stay, duration of ventilation, infection, and use of insulin. A total of 46 730 children were included; 54% received corticosteroids. In multivariable analysis, there was no difference in mortality among corticosteroid recipients and nonrecipients (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.98 to 1.30). Corticosteroids were associated with longer length of stay (least square mean difference, 2.18 days; 95% confidence interval, 1.62 to 2.74 days), greater infection (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 1.46), and greater use of insulin (odds ratio, 2.45; 95% confidence interval, 2.24 to 2.67). There was no difference in duration of ventilation. In analysis stratified by RACHS-1 category, no significant benefit was seen in any group, and the association of corticosteroids with increased morbidity was most prominent in RACHS-1 categories 1 through 3. CONCLUSION: In this observational analysis of children undergoing congenital heart surgery, we were unable to demonstrate a significant benefit associated with corticosteroids and found that corticosteroids may be associated with increased morbidity, particularly in lower-risk patients.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: In 2007, the American Heart Association recommended cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis (IE) before dental procedures for all but those at highest risk for adverse outcomes from IE. The impact of these guidelines is unclear. We evaluated IE hospitalizations at US children's hospitals during this period. METHODS: Children <18 years old hospitalized from 2003 to 2010 with IE at 37 centers in the Pediatric Health Information Systems Database were included. Using Poisson regression, we evaluated the number IE hospitalizations over time (raw and indexed to total hospital admissions). RESULTS: A total of 1157 IE cases were identified; 68% had congenital heart disease (CHD). The raw number of IE cases did not change significantly over time (+1.6% difference post vs pre guidelines, 95% CI -6.4% to +10.3%, P = .7). When the number of IE cases was indexed per 1,000 hospital admissions, there was a significant decline during the time period before the guidelines (annual change: -5.9%, 95% CI -9.9 to -1.8, P = .005) and a similar decline in the post guidelines period such that the difference between the 2 periods was not significant (P = .15). In subgroup analysis, no significant change over time in IE cases (raw or indexed) was found in the CHD subset, those 5 to 18 years old (subgroup most likely receiving dental care), or in cases coded as oral streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that release of new antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines was associated with a significant change in IE admissions across 37 US children's hospitals.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The use of clinical registries and administrative data sets in pediatric cardiovascular research has become increasingly common. However, this approach is limited by relatively few existing datasets, each of which contain limited data, and do not communicate with one another. We describe the implementation and validation of methodology using indirect patient identifiers to link The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery (STS-CHS) Database to The Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) Database (a pediatric administrative database). METHODS: Centers submitting data to STS-CHS and PHIS during 2004 to 2008 were included (n=30). Both data sets were limited to patients 0 to 18 years old undergoing cardiac surgery. An exact match was defined as an exact match on each of the following: date of birth, date of admission, date of discharge, sex, and center. Likely matches were defined as an exact match for all variables except +/-1 day for one of the date variables. RESULTS: Of 45,830 STS-CHS records, 87.4% matched to PHIS using the exact match criteria and 90.3% using the exact or likely match criteria. Validation in a subset of patients revealed that 100% of exact and likely matches were true matches. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates that indirect identifiers can be used to create high-quality link between a clinical registry and administrative data set in the congenital heart surgery population. This methodology, which can also be applied to other data sets, allows researchers to capitalize on the strengths of both types of data and expands the pool of data available to answer important clinical questions.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have called into question the benefit of perioperative corticosteroids in children undergoing heart surgery, but have been limited by the lack of placebo control, limited power, and grouping of various steroid regimens together in analysis. We evaluated outcomes across methylprednisolone regimens versus no steroids in a large cohort of neonates. METHODS: Clinical data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database were linked to medication data from the Pediatric Health Information Systems Database for neonates (</=30 days) undergoing heart surgery (2004-2008) at 25 participating centers. Multivariable analysis adjusting for patient and center characteristics, surgical risk category, and within-center clustering was used to evaluate the association of methylprednisolone regimen with outcome. RESULTS: A total of 3180 neonates were included: 22% received methylprednisolone on both the day before and day of surgery, 12% on the day before surgery only, and 28% on the day of surgery only; 38% did not receive any perioperative steroids. In multivariable analysis, there was no significant mortality or length-of-stay benefit associated with any methylprednisolone regimen versus no steroids, and no difference in postoperative infection. In subgroup analysis by surgical-risk group, there was a significant association of methylprednisolone with infection consistent across all regimens (overall odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-5.2) in the lower-surgical-risk group. CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter observational analysis did not find any benefit associated with methylprednisolone in neonates undergoing heart surgery and suggested increased infection in certain subgroups. These data reinforce the need for a large randomized trial in this population.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: In the Single Ventricle Reconstruction trial, infants undergoing the Norwood procedure were randomly allocated to undergo a right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt or a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. Apart from shunt type, subjects received the local standard of care. We evaluated variation in perioperative care during the Norwood hospitalization across 14 trial sites. METHODS: Data on preoperative, operative, and postoperative variables for 546 enrolled subjects who underwent the Norwood procedure were collected prospectively on standardized case report forms, and variation across the centers was described. RESULTS: Gestational age, birth weight, and proportion with hypoplastic left heart syndrome were similar across sites. In contrast, all recorded variables related to preoperative care varied across centers, including fetal diagnosis (range, 55%-85%), preoperative intubation (range, 29%-91%), and enteral feeding. Perioperative and operative factors were also variable across sites, including median total support time (range, 74-189 minutes) and other perfusion variables, arch reconstruction technique, intraoperative medication use, and use of modified ultrafiltration (range, 48%-100%). Additional variation across centers was seen in variables related to postoperative care, including proportion with an open sternum (range, 35%-100%), median intensive care unit stay (range, 9-44 days), type of feeding at discharge, and enrollment in a home monitoring program (range, 1%-100%; 5 sites did not have a program). Overall, in-hospital death or transplant occurred in 18% (range across sites, 7%-39%). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative care during the Norwood hospitalization varies across centers. Further analysis evaluating the underlying causes and relationship of this variation to outcome is needed to inform future studies and quality improvement efforts.},

METHODS: By using 2005-2007 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data, outpatient preventive visits made by obese (body mass index >/=95%) 2- to 18-year-old patients were examined for frequencies of obesity diagnosis, diet, exercise, or weight reduction counseling, and glucose or cholesterol testing. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine whether patient-level (gender, age, race/ethnicity, insurance type) and provider/practice-level (geographic region, provider specialty, and practice setting) factors were associated with physician obesity diagnosis. RESULTS: Physicians documented an obesity diagnosis in 18% (95% confidence interval, 13-23) of visits made by 2- to 18-year-old patients with a body mass index >/=95%. Documentation of an obesity diagnosis was more likely for non-white patients (odds ratio 2.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.3). Physicians were more likely to provide obesity-related counseling (51% of visits) than to conduct laboratory testing (10% of visits) for obese pediatric patients. CONCLUSION: Rates of documented obesity diagnosis, obesity-related counseling, and laboratory testing for comorbid conditions among obese pediatric patients seen in US outpatient preventive visits are suboptimal. Efforts should target enhanced obesity diagnosis as a first step toward improving pediatric obesity management.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Pediatric cervical spine injuries are uncommon. Most previous studies have been hampered by the small number of patients available for evaluation. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence and characteristics of pediatric cervical spine injury utilizing a multiinstitutional pediatric trauma database, and to assess the impact of age and level of spine injury on mortality rate. METHODS: All children with cervical spine injury entered into the National Pediatric Trauma Registry over a consecutive 10-year period were identified. Patients were stratified by age, mortality, presence or absence of bony injury, level of cervical spine injury, and presence of neurologic deficit. Data were analyzed utilizing Student's t test for continuous variables and chi(2) analysis for categorical variables. Statistical significance was accepted at the P less than .05 level. RESULTS: From a database of 75,172 injured children, 1,098 were identified with cervical spine injury, overall incidence 1.5%. The mean age of the study group was 11 +/- 5 years, and 61% were boys. Nine hundred eight children (83%) had bony spine injury. Distribution of bony injury among upper cervical spine, lower cervical spine, or both was 52%, 28%, and 7%, respectively. The remaining 13% comprised unspecified levels of injury. Upper cervical spine injuries were prevalent among all age groups (42%, age < or = 8; 58%, age > 8), whereas lower spine injuries predominated in older children (85%, age > 8). One third of children in the study group had neurologic injury, and half of these had no radiographic evidence of bony injury. Ninety-four children (24%) had a complete cord injury, and the remaining 76% had an incomplete spinal cord injury. One hundred eleven children (23%) with upper spine injury died compared with 11 children (4%) with lower spine injury. Mortality rate was highest (48%) in those with atlanto-occipital dislocation. CONCLUSIONS: From this, the largest experience with pediatric cervical spine injury, several conclusions can be drawn. (1) Cervical spine injury occurs in 1.5% of injured children. (2) Upper cervical spine injuries are not limited to younger children but are equally prevalent in both age groups. (3) Associated mortality rate is nearly 6-fold higher in patients with upper cervical injury. (4) Seventeen percent of children with cervical spine trauma show no radiologic anomaly, yet 50% of children with cervical spinal cord injury have no initial radiologic abnormalities. (5) Of those in whom cervical spine injury is associated with a neurologic deficit, the deficit is complete in 24% of children.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To examine characteristics of women with negotiated treatment plans, factors that contribute to newly forming a treatment plan, and the impact of plans on asthma management, and their satisfaction with care over 2 years. METHODS: Data came from telephone interviews with 324 women with asthma at baseline, 12 and 24 months. The effect of having a negotiated treatment plan on medication adherence, asking the physician questions about asthma, asthma management self-efficacy, and satisfaction with care was assessed over 24 months. Data were analyzed using mixed models. Analyses controlled for patient characteristics. RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent of participants reported having a negotiated treatment plan at three time points. Seeing an asthma specialist (chi(2)(1) = 24.07, p < .001), was associated with having a plan. Women who did not have a negotiated treatment plan at baseline, but acquired one at 12 or 24 months, were more likely to report greater urgent office visits for asthma (odds ratio (OR) = 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-1.61). No associations were observed between having a plan and urgent healthcare use or symptom frequency. When adjusting for household income, level of asthma control, and specialty of the caregiving provider, women who did not have a negotiated treatment plan (OR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.09-0.79) and those with a plan at fewer than three time points (OR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.11-0.83) were less likely to report medication adherence and satisfaction with their care (regression coefficient (standard error) = -0.65 (0.17), p < .001). No differences in asthma management self-efficacy or asking the doctor questions about asthma were observed. CONCLUSION: Women with asthma who had a negotiated treatment plan were more likely to see an asthma specialist. In the long-term, not having a treatment plan that is developed in partnership with a clinician may have an adverse impact on medication use and patient views of clinical services.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Asthma action plans (AAPs) are a priority recommendation of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and have been shown to positively affect health outcomes. Patient satisfaction is an important clinical outcome, yet little is known about its association with receiving an AAP. This study examined the association between having an AAP and behaviors to keep asthma in control and patient satisfaction with care. METHODS: The study design was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a randomized trial evaluating a self-management program among 808 women with asthma. Participants reported demographic information, interactions with clinicians, whether they had an AAP and owned a peak flow meter, self-management behaviors, and symptoms. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 48 +/-13.6 years, 84% (n= 670) were satisfied with their asthma care, and 48% (n= 383) had a written AAP from their physician. Women not having an AAP were less likely to take asthma medication as prescribed [ x 2 (1) = 13.68, P , .001], to initiate a discussion about asthma with their physicians [ x 2 (1) = 26.35, P < .001], and to own a peak fl ow meter [ x 2 (1) =77.84, P < .001]. Adjusting for asthma control, income, and medical specialty,women who did not have an AAP were more likely to report dissatisfaction with their asthma care (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.35-3.17; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Women without an AAP were less likely to initiate discussions with their physicians,take medications as prescribed, and own a peak fl ow meter to monitor asthma, all considered important self-management behaviors. They were also less satisfied with their care. Not having an AAP may affect interactions between patient and physician and clinical outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Experimental data suggest sleep deprivation may impair host immunity. We sought to assess the effect of poor sleep on pneumonia risk. DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: 56,953 female nurses (ages 37 to 57 years old) participating in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort free of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and asthma with no prior history of pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: At baseline, participants reported their average sleep duration and whether this quantity was adequate for them. Questionnaires ascertaining a new pneumonia diagnosis were mailed every 2 years. Cases required physician diagnosis and chest radiograph confirmation. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the relative risk for incident pneumonia over 4 years. Over 217,500 person-years, 977 cases of pneumonia were identified. Relative to 8-h sleepers, both short and long sleep durations were associated with elevated pneumonia risk. The age-adjusted relative risk for pneumonia was 1.70 (95% CI 1.30-2.23) in those sleeping </= 5 h and 1.49 (95% CI 1.12-1.98) in those sleeping >/= 9 h. After adjusting for potential confounders, the relative risks were 1.39 (95% CI: 1.06-1.82) in those sleeping </= 5 h and 1.38 (95% CI 1.04-1.84) in those sleeping >/= 9 h. Perceived inadequate sleep was also associated with pneumonia with a relative risk of 1.50 (95% CI 1.29-1.74) in multivariate models. CONCLUSIONS: Both reduced and prolonged habitual sleep durations are associated with increased risk of pneumonia. Further research is needed to understand how sleep habits can influence immunity.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the NICU. In 2010, Medicaid was mandated not to pay hospitals for treatment of CLABSI; however, the source of CLABSI data for this policy was not specified. Our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of hospital administrative data compared with CLABSI confirmed by an infection control service. METHODS: We evaluated hospital administrative and infection control data for newborns admitted consecutively from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2010. Clinical and demographic data were collected through chart review. We compared cases of CLABSI identified by administrative data (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 999.31) with infection control data that use national criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the gold standard. To ascertain the nature possible deficiencies in the administrative data, each patient's medical record was searched to determine if clinical phrases that commonly refer to CLABSI appeared. RESULTS: Of 2920 infants admitted to the NICU during our study period, 52 were identified as having a CLABSI: 42 by infection control data only, 7 through hospital administrative data only, and 3 appearing in both. Against the gold standard, hospital administrative data were 6.7% sensitive and 99.7% specific, with a positive predictive value of 30.0% and a negative predictive value of 98.6%. Only 48% of medical records indicated a CLABSI. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings from a major children's hospital NICU indicate that International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 993.31 is presently not accurate and cannot be used reliably to compare CLABSI rates in NICUs.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Although CT scans are very useful clinically, potential cancer risks exist from associated ionising radiation, in particular for children who are more radiosensitive than adults. We aimed to assess the excess risk of leukaemia and brain tumours after CT scans in a cohort of children and young adults. METHODS: In our retrospective cohort study, we included patients without previous cancer diagnoses who were first examined with CT in National Health Service (NHS) centres in England, Wales, or Scotland (Great Britain) between 1985 and 2002, when they were younger than 22 years of age. We obtained data for cancer incidence, mortality, and loss to follow-up from the NHS Central Registry from Jan 1, 1985, to Dec 31, 2008. We estimated absorbed brain and red bone marrow doses per CT scan in mGy and assessed excess incidence of leukaemia and brain tumours cancer with Poisson relative risk models. To avoid inclusion of CT scans related to cancer diagnosis, follow-up for leukaemia began 2 years after the first CT and for brain tumours 5 years after the first CT. FINDINGS: During follow-up, 74 of 178 604 patients were diagnosed with leukaemia and 135 of 176 587 patients were diagnosed with brain tumours. We noted a positive association between radiation dose from CT scans and leukaemia (excess relative risk [ERR] per mGy 0.036, 95% CI 0.005-0.120; p=0.0097) and brain tumours (0.023, 0.010-0.049; p<0.0001). Compared with patients who received a dose of less than 5 mGy, the relative risk of leukaemia for patients who received a cumulative dose of at least 30 mGy (mean dose 51.13 mGy) was 3.18 (95% CI 1.46-6.94) and the relative risk of brain cancer for patients who received a cumulative dose of 50-74 mGy (mean dose 60.42 mGy) was 2.82 (1.33-6.03). INTERPRETATION: Use of CT scans in children to deliver cumulative doses of about 50 mGy might almost triple the risk of leukaemia and doses of about 60 mGy might triple the risk of brain cancer. Because these cancers are relatively rare, the cumulative absolute risks are small: in the 10 years after the first scan for patients younger than 10 years, one excess case of leukaemia and one excess case of brain tumour per 10 000 head CT scans is estimated to occur. Nevertheless, although clinical benefits should outweigh the small absolute risks, radiation doses from CT scans ought to be kept as low as possible and alternative procedures, which do not involve ionising radiation, should be considered if appropriate.

  Abstract                 = {Pulseless cardiac arrest, defined as the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity, determined by unresponsiveness, apneoa, and the absence of a palpable central pulse, accounts for around one-twentieth of admissions to paediatric intensive care units, be they medical or exclusively cardiac. Such cardiac arrest is higher in children admitted to a cardiac as opposed to a paediatric intensive care unit, but the outcome of these patients is better, with just over two-fifths surviving when treated in the cardiac intensive care unit, versus between one-sixth and one-quarter of those admitted to paediatric intensive care units. Children who receive chest compressions for bradycardia with pulses have a significantly higher rate of survival to discharge, at 60%, than do those presenting with pulseless cardiac arrest, with only 27% surviving to discharge. This suggests that early resuscitation before the patient becomes pulseless, along with early recognition and intervention, are likely to improve outcomes. Recently published reports of in-hospital cardiac arrests in children can be derived from the multi-centric National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation provided by the American Heart Association. The population is heterogeneous, but most arrests occurred in children with progressive respiratory insufficiency, and/or progressive circulatory shock. During the past 4 years at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 3.1% of the average 1000 annual admissions to the cardiac intensive care unit have received cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Overall survival of those receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation was 46%. Survival was better for those receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation after cardiac surgery, at 53%, compared with survival of 33% for pre-operative or non-surgical patients undergoing resuscitation. Clearly there is room for improvement in outcomes from cardiac resuscitation in children with cardiac disease. In this review, therefore, we summarize the newest developments in paediatric resuscitation, with an expanded focus upon the unique challenges and importance of anticipatory care in infants and children with cardiac disease.},

  Abstract                 = {The replication of important findings by multiple independent investigators is fundamental to the accumulation of scientific evidence. Researchers in the biologic and physical sciences expect results to be replicated by independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments. Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is "reproducibility," which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate practical prognostic models for death at 14 days and for death or severe disability six months after traumatic brain injury. DESIGN: Multivariable logistic regression to select variables that were independently associated with two patient outcomes. Two models designed: "basic" model (demographic and clinical variables only) and "CT" model (basic model plus results of computed tomography). The models were subsequently developed for high and low-middle income countries separately. SETTING: Medical Research Council (MRC) CRASH Trial. SUBJECTS: 10,008 patients with traumatic brain injury. Models externally validated in a cohort of 8509. RESULTS: The basic model included four predictors: age, Glasgow coma scale, pupil reactivity, and the presence of major extracranial injury. The CT model also included the presence of petechial haemorrhages, obliteration of the third ventricle or basal cisterns, subarachnoid bleeding, midline shift, and non-evacuated haematoma. In the derivation sample the models showed excellent discrimination (C statistic above 0.80). The models showed good calibration graphically. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test also indicated good calibration, except for the CT model in low-middle income countries. External validation for unfavourable outcome at six months in high income countries showed that basic and CT models had good discrimination (C statistic 0.77 for both models) but poorer calibration. CONCLUSION: Simple prognostic models can be used to obtain valid predictions of relevant outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury.},

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTINGS: Pediatric intensive care unit of a children's hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty-eight children with closed head injury. Interventions: Intravenous infusion of 3% hypertonic saline to increase serum sodium to levels necessary to reduce ICP < or =20 mm Hg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients enrolled had similar Injury Severity Scores. Treatment effectively lowered ICP in these patients and ICP was under good control a majority of the time. Only three patients (4%) died of uncontrolled elevation of ICP. No adverse effects of supraphysiologic hyperosmolarity such as renal failure, pulmonary edema, or central pontine demyelination, were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertonic saline administration to children with closed head injury appears to be a promising therapy for control of cerebral edema. Further controlled trials are required to determine the optimal duration of treatment before widespread use is advocated.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Cervical spine clearance in the very young child is challenging. Radiographic imaging to diagnose cervical spine injuries (CSI) even in the absence of clinical findings is common, raising concerns about radiation exposure and imaging-related complications. We examined whether simple clinical criteria can be used to safely rule out CSI in patients younger than 3 years. METHODS: The trauma registries from 22 level I or II trauma centers were reviewed for the 10-year period (January 1995 to January 2005). Blunt trauma patients younger than 3 years were identified. The measured outcome was CSI. Independent predictors of CSI were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis. A weighted score was calculated by assigning 1, 2, or 3 points to each independent predictor according to its magnitude of effect. The score was established on two thirds of the population and validated using the remaining one third. RESULTS: Of 12,537 patients younger than 3 years, CSI was identified in 83 patients (0.66%), eight had spinal cord injury. Four independent predictors of CSI were identified: Glasgow Coma Score <14, GCSEYE = 1, motor vehicle crash, and age 2 years or older. A score of <2 had a negative predictive value of 99.93% in ruling out CSI. A total of 8,707 patients (69.5% of all patients) had a score of <2 and were eligible for cervical spine clearance without imaging. There were no missed CSI in this study. CONCLUSIONS: CSI in patients younger than 3 years is uncommon. Four simple clinical predictors can be used in conjunction to the physical examination to substantially reduce the use of radiographic imaging in this patient population.},

  Abstract                 = {Survival of children (< 17 years) with severe head injuries (Glascow Coma Scale [GCS] score < 8) has been shown to be better than that of adults. The addition of hypotension (HT) or hypoxia (H) has a deleterious effect on outcome in adults but no information is currently available about their effects in children. Over a 5-year period, 58 children with GCS scores < 8 were admitted and prospectively evaluated at this institution. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and arterial blood gasses. Patients exhibiting HT, defined as a SBP < 90 mm Hg, and patients demonstrating H with a PaO2 < 60 mm Hg were compared with normoxic, normotensive children. Survival was increased fourfold in patients with neither H nor HT as compared with children with either H or HT (P < .001). To validate these observations we reviewed the data from the National Pediatric Trauma Registry for similar patients and included our cohort in the analysis. In total, 509 children had sufficient data for analysis and were studied. Hypoxia alone was not associated with increased mortality in normotensive patients (P = .34). Hypotension significantly increased mortality in these children even without concomitant H (P < .00001). If both HT and H were found together, mortality was only slightly increased over those children with HT alone (P = .056). These data confirm that HT with or without H causes significantly increased mortality in head-injured children to those levels normally found in adults (P = .9), alleviating any age-related protective mechanisms normally afforded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Cervical spine injuries are uncommon in pediatric trauma patients. Previous studies were often limited by the small numbers of patients available for evaluation. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and characteristics of pediatric cervical spine injuries at this Level 1 trauma center and to review the authors' experiences with documented cases. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of all pediatric trauma patients with skeletal and/or nonskeletal injuries of the spine that were admitted to this Level 1 trauma center between 1980 and 2004. Those with significant injuries of the cervical spine were identified and included in this study. Pediatric patients were defined as patients younger than the age of 17 years. In addition, they were stratified by age into two study groups: group A included patients aged 8 years or fewer and group B contained patients from the ages of 9 to 16 years. RESULTS: We found 56 pediatric patients with injuries of the cervical spine that met criteria for inclusion. Thirty-one female and 25 male patients with an average age of 8.9 years (range, 1-16 years) sustained significant skeletal and/or nonskeletal injuries of the cervical spine and were entered in this study. Thirty patients (54%) were aged 8 years or fewer and entered into study group A, whereas 26 patients (46%) from the ages of 9 to 16 met criteria for inclusion in study group B. An analysis of data revealed that younger patients (group A) showed significantly more injuries of the upper cervical spine, whereas older children (group B) sustained significantly more injuries of the lower level. Spinal cord injuries without radiographic findings were only found in study group A. In addition, younger children were more likely injured by motor vehicle crashes, whereas older children more commonly sustained C-spine injuries during sports activities. Two-thirds of our patients showed neurologic deficits, and the overall mortality was 28%. CONCLUSION: The results of our study were similar to several previous reports, underscoring a low incidence (1.2%) and age-related characteristics. Younger children had a predilection for injuries of the upper cervical spine, whereas children in the older age group sustained significantly more injuries of the lower cervical spine. Spinal cord injuries without radiographic abnormalities were only seen in the younger age group. Despite the low incidence of cervical spine injuries in pediatric patients, increased efforts at prevention are demanded because mortality rate (27%) and incidence of neurologic deficits (66%) were dreadfully high in our series.},

  Abstract                 = {Intranasal corticosteroids (INCs) act predominantly locally and are considered to exert minimal systemic effects. On reviewing the international data collected in the World Health Organization's global pharmacovigilance programme an unexpected cluster was found of 38 case reports of migraine in suspected connection with INCs. These reports came from five countries (May 2007) and concerned six different drugs. In all reports the INC was the sole suspect drug. In nine cases re-exposure to the drug had taken place, leading to the recurrence of the event in eight of these patients. However, INCs are mainly used for rhinitis, and there is a known connection between rhinitis and migraine. Although representing only 0.6% of the total of case reports, international pharmacovigilance data suggest that the use of INCs may cause or trigger migraine or migraine-like headache. Further study is needed to determine if the reported association is true or not and, if so, what the possible mechanism is.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The systemic use of corticosteroids is connected with a variety of psychiatric and neurologic effects. Corticosteroids for intranasal administration (INCs) are considered to act locally and to exert minimal systemic effects. An unexpected cluster of case reports of neuropsychiatric disorders during intranasal corticosteroid use was reported to the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Centre. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible connection between intranasal corticosteroid use and the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, as reported to the International Pharmacovigilance Programme. METHODS: All reports containing adverse event terms indicating neuropsychiatric disturbances in suspected connection with intranasal corticosteroids were retrieved from Vigibase and evaluated (April 2006). The case reports are heterogeneous and vary regarding source, documentation quality, and relationship likelihood. RESULTS: A total of 429 reports were received from 16 countries (1980-April 2006), of neuropsychiatric events occurring in patients using INCs, representing 7.6% of the total of reports regarding these drugs in the same period. Frequently reported events were nervousness, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, emotional lability, depression, somnolence, confusion, convulsions, and migraine. Most reports concerned fluticasone propionate, beclometasone dipropionate, mometasone furoate, or budesonide. In 370 reports (86.2%), the INC was the sole suspect drug and in 220 (51.3%) it was the only drug used. In 97 of 108 patients who had discontinued use of the intranasal corticosteroid, the reaction abated. Of 41 patients, 32 had a relapse when the drug was reintroduced. CONCLUSIONS: The data collected by the International Pharmacovigilance Programme suggest that the intranasal use of corticosteroids can be complicated by neuropsychiatric adverse reactions. Further study is needed to confirm the connection and to determine the frequency and risk factors of such reactions.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Blunt cervical spine injury (CSI) is rare in the pediatric population. The objective of this study was to better characterize the incidence and type of CSI in young children (age <3 years) using a large, trauma center-based data set. METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) was reviewed for the period January 2001 to December 2005 for patients younger than 3 years of age with a blunt CSI (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 805x, 806x, 952x). Demographic, injury, and outcome information were reviewed. Data management was performed using SAS (SAS, Cary, NC) and Stata (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). Patients with CSI were compared to patients without CSI of similar age. Means were compared with the Wilcoxon rank sum test, medians were compared with a nonparametric test, and count data were compared with the chi(2) test, with significance set at <.05. RESULTS: For the period of review, 95,654 young children (age <3 years) with blunt trauma were identified in the NTDB. The overall population had a median Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 4, and most patients (77.01%) had a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15. There were 1523 (1.59%) patients with a CSI (spinal cord and/or column), including 366 patients (0.38%) with a spinal cord injury (with or without column injury) and 182 (0.19%) with an isolated spinal cord injury (SCIWORA). The CSI and non-CSI populations did not differ regarding median GCS (15 for both groups), but the CSI population had a significantly higher median ISS (14 vs 4, respectively; P < .001). Compared to patients without CSI, the CSI population was more likely to die in the emergency department (2.04% vs 1.25%; P = .007) or be admitted to the intensive care unit (45.3% vs 16.9%; P < .001). Nearly half of all cervical spine fractures (48%) and more than half of cervical spinal cord injuries (53%) were in the lower cervical spine (C5-7). MVCs were the most common injury mechanism (66%) followed by falls (15%). A CSI was observed in 3.2% of all motor vehicle crashes (MVCs). CONCLUSIONS: In this trauma center population, these findings confirm the infrequency of blunt CSI in the youngest (age <3 years) trauma patients. The frequency of injuries to the lower cervical spine is higher than previously appreciated. MVCs are the most likely injury mechanism for this potentially devastating injury.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: The relationship between physiologic status and mortality risk should be reevaluated as new treatment protocols, therapeutic interventions, and monitoring strategies are introduced and as patient populations change. We developed and validated a third-generation pediatric physiology-based score for mortality risk, Pediatric Risk of Mortality III (PRISM III). DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: There were 32 pediatric intensive care units (ICUs): 16 pediatric ICUs were randomly chosen and 16 volunteered. PATIENTS: Consecutive admissions at each site were included until at least 11 deaths per site occurred. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Physiologic data included the most abnormal values from the first 12 and the second 12 hrs of ICU stay. Outcomes and descriptive data were also collected. Physiologic variables where normal values change with age were stratified by age (neonate, infant, child, adolescent). The database was randomly split into development (90%) and validation (10%) sets. Variables and their ranges were chosen by computing the risk of death (odds ratios) relative to the midrange of survivors for each physiologic variable. Univariate and multivariate statistical procedures, including multiple logistic regression analysis, were used to develop the PRISM III score and mortality risk predictors. Data were collected on 11,165 admissions (543 deaths). The PRISM III score has 17 physiologic variables subdivided into 26 ranges. The variables most predictive of mortality were minimum systolic blood pressure, abnormal pupillary reflexes, and stupor/coma. Other risk factors, including two acute and two chronic diagnoses, and four additional risk factors, were used in the final predictors. The PRISM III score and the additional risk factors were applied to the first 12 hrs of stay (PRISM III-12) and the first 24 hours of stay (PRISM III-24). The Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square goodness-of-fit evaluations demonstrated absence of significant calibration errors (p values: PRISM III-12 development = .2496; PRISM III-24 development = .1374; PRISM III-12 validation = .4168; PRISM III-24 validation = .5504). The area under the receiver operating curve and Flora's z-statistic indicated excellent discrimination and accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve - PRISM III-12 development 947 +/- 0.007; PRISM III-24 development 0.958 +/- 0.006; PRISM III-12 validation 0.941 +/- 0.021; PRISM III-24 validation 0.944 +/- 0.021; Flora's z-statistic - PRISM III-12 validation = .7479; PRISM III-24 validation = .9225), although generally, the PRISM III-24 performed better than the PRISM III-12 models. Excellent goodness-of-fit was also found for patient groups stratified by age (significance levels: PRISM III-12 = .1622; PRISM III-24 = .4137), and by diagnosis (significance levels: PRISM III-12 = .5992; PRISM III-24 = .7939). CONCLUSIONS: PRISM III resulted in several improvements over the original PRISM. Reassessment of physiologic variables and their ranges, better age adjustment for selected variables, and additional risk factors resulted in a mortality risk model that is more accurate and discriminates better. The large number of diverse ICUs in the database indicates PRISM III is more likely to be representative of United States units.},

  Abstract                 = {IMPORTANCE: Functional status assessment methods are important as outcome measures for pediatric critical care studies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between the 2 functional status assessment methods appropriate for large-sample studies, the Functional Status Scale (FSS) and the Pediatric Overall Performance Category and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (POPC/PCPC) scales. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study with random patient selection at 7 sites and 8 children's hospitals with general/medical and cardiac/cardiovascular pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network. Participants included all PICU patients younger than 18 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Functional Status Scale and POPC/PCPC scores determined at PICU admission (baseline) and PICU discharge. We investigated the association between the baseline and PICU discharge POPC/PCPC scores and the baseline and PICU discharge FSS scores, the dispersion of FSS scores within each of the POPC/PCPC ratings, and the relationship between the FSS neurologic components (FSS-CNS) and the PCPC. RESULTS: We included 5017 patients. We found a significant (P < .001) difference between FSS scores in each POPC or PCPC interval, with an FSS score increase with each worsening POPC/PCPC rating. The FSS scores for the good and mild disability POPC/PCPC ratings were similar and increased by 2 to 3 points for the POPC/PCPC change from mild to moderate disability, 5 to 6 points for moderate to severe disability, and 8 to 9 points for severe disability to vegetative state or coma. The dispersion of FSS scores within each POPC and PCPC rating was substantial and increased with worsening POPC and PCPC scores. We also found a significant (P < .001) difference between the FSS-CNS scores between each of the PCPC ratings with increases in the FSS-CNS score for each higher PCPC rating. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The FSS and POPC/PCPC system are closely associated. Increases in FSS scores occur with each higher POPC and PCPC rating and with greater magnitudes of change as the dysfunction severity increases. However, the dispersion of the FSS scores indicated a lack of precision in the POPC/PCPC system when compared with the more objective and granular FSS. The relationship between the PCPC and the FSS-CNS paralleled the relationship between the FSS and POPC/PCPC system.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to create a functional status outcome measure for large outcome studies that is well defined, quantitative, rapid, reliable, minimally dependent on subjective assessments, and applicable to hospitalized pediatric patients across a wide range of ages and inpatient environments. METHODS: Functional Status Scale (FSS) domains of functioning included mental status, sensory functioning, communication, motor functioning, feeding, and respiratory status, categorized from normal (score = 1) to very severe dysfunction (score = 5). The Adaptive Behavior Assessment System II (ABAS II) established construct validity and calibration within domains. Seven institutions provided PICU patients within 24 hours before or after PICU discharge, high-risk non-PICU patients within 24 hours after admission, and technology-dependent children. Primary care nurses completed the ABAS II. Statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 836 children, with a mean FSS score of 10.3 (SD: 4.4), were studied. Eighteen percent had the minimal possible FSS score of 6, 44% had FSS scores of >or=10, 14% had FSS scores of >or=15, and 6% had FSS scores of >or=20. Each FSS domain was associated with mean ABAS II scores (P < .0001). Cells in each domain were collapsed and reweighted, which improved correlations with ABAS II scores (P < .001 for improvements). Discrimination was very good for moderate and severe dysfunction (ABAS II categories) and improved with FSS weighting. Intraclass correlations of original and weighted total FSS scores were 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The FSS met our objectives and is well suited for large outcome studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Neurologic and neuropsychologic sequelae of crush head injury, which is produced by static forces occurring when the head is stationary and pinned against a rigid structure, were studied prospectively in a series of eight children ranging in age from 13 to 32 months. Hospital course, computed tomographic findings, and neurologic and developmental outcomes were examined. All children sustained pronounced cerebral trauma characterized by multiple fractures throughout the calvaria, extra-axial hemorrhages, and parenchymal contusions. Cranial nerve injuries were noted in three and hemiparesis in two of the cases. Two months after the injury, 63% of the children displayed deficits in either IQ or motor functioning. One year after the injury, five of the six children reevaluated had a good recovery. Motor scores were significantly lower than cognitive scores at baseline and showed the greatest degree of improvement over time. Neuropsychologic outcome after brain injury produced by static loading of the head is more favorable than from traumatic brain injury associated with dynamic loading.},

  Abstract                 = {Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a life-threatening complication of rheumatic diseases that is thought to be caused by the activation and uncontrolled proliferation of T lymphocytes and macrophages, leading to widespread haemophagocytosis and cytokine overproduction. It is seen most commonly in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but is increasingly recognized also in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (J-SLE). Recognition of MAS in patients with J-SLE is often challenging because it may mimic the clinical features of the underlying disease or be confused with an infectious complication. This review summarizes the characteristics of patients with J-SLE-associated MAS reported in the literature or seen by the authors and analyses the distinctive clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic issues that the occurrence of MAS may raise in patients with J-SLE.},

Although a number of additional antibiotics, including other aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, antibiotics in the polymyxin class, and vancomycin, have been administered as aerosols for many years, none are approved by the FDA for administration by inhalation. TOBI was approved by the FDA for the maintenance therapy of patients 6 years or older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have between 25% and 75% of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), are colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and are able to comply with the prescribed medical regimen. TOBI was not approved for the therapy of acute pulmonary exacerbations in patients with CF nor was it approved for use in patients without CF. Currently, no other antibiotics are approved for administration by inhalation to patients with or without CF. The purpose of this statement is to briefly summarize the data that supported approval for licensure of TOBI and to provide recommendations for its safe use. The pharmacokinetics of inhaled aminoglycosides and problems associated with aerosolized antibiotic treatment, including environmental contamination, selection of resistant microbes, and airway exposure to excipients in intravenous formulations, will be discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the trend in utilization of repeat (i.e. >/=2) computed tomography (CT) and to compare utilization patterns across body regions for trauma patients admitted to a level I trauma center for traffic-related injuries (TRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We linked the Harborview Medical Center trauma registry (1996-2010) to the billing department data. We extracted the following variables: type and frequency of CTs performed, age, gender, race/ethnicity, insurance status, injury mechanism and severity, length of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and final disposition. TRIs were defined as motor vehicle collisions, motorcycle, bicycle and pedestrian-related injuries. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between utilization of different body region repeat (i.e. >/=2) CTs and year of admission, adjusting for patient and injury-related characteristics that could influence utilization patterns. RESULTS: A total of 28,431 patients were admitted for TRIs over the study period and 9499 (33%) received repeat CTs. From 1996 to 2010, the proportion of patients receiving repeat CTs decreased by 33%. Relative to 2000 and adjusting for other covariates, patients with TRIs admitted in 2010 had significantly lower odds of undergoing repeat head (OR=0.61; 95% CI: 0.49-0.76), pelvis (OR=0.37; 95% CI: 0.27-0.52), cervical spine (OR=0.23; 95% CI: 0.12-0.43), and maxillofacial CTs (OR=0.24; 95% CI: 0.10-0.57). However, they had higher odds of receiving repeat thoracic CTs (OR=1.86; 95% CI: 1.02-3.38). CONCLUSION: A significant decrease in the utilization of repeat CTs was observed in trauma patients presenting with traffic-related injuries over a 15-year period.},

  Abstract                 = {A protocol is proposed to allow linkage of anonymous medical information within the framework of epidemiological follow-up studies. The protocol is composed of two steps; the first concerns the irreversible transformation of identification data, using a one-way hash function which is used after spelling processing. To avoid dictionary attacks, two large random files of keys, called pads, are introduced. The second step consists in the linkage of files rendered anonymous. The weight given to each linkage field is estimated by a mixture model, the likelihood of which being maximized with the Expectation and Maximization (EM) algorithm. The performance of this method has been assessed by comparing record linkage, based on exclusive use of the automatic procedure, with a manual linkage, obtained by the Burgundy Registry of Digestive Cancers. The result of the linkage of a file of 2,847 cancers with a file of 388,614 hospitalization stays in the Dijon university hospital showed a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 93%.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: The scientific quality of published clinical trials is generally poor in studies where compression devices have been assessed in the management of venous disease. The authors' aim was to establish a set of guidelines which could be used in the design of future clinical trials of compression treatments for venous diseases. DESIGN: Consensus conference leading to a consensus statement. METHODS: The authors form a expert consensus group known as the International Compression Club (ICC). This group obtained published medical literature in the field of compression treatment in venous disease by searching medical literature databases. The literature was studied by the group which attended a consensus meeting. A draft document was circulated to ICC members and revised until agreement between contributors was reached. RESULTS: The authors have prepared a set of guidelines which should be given consideration when conducting studies to assess the efficacy of compression in venous disease. CONCLUSIONS: The form of compression therapy including the comparators used in the clinical study must be clearly characterised. In future studies the characteristics of the material provided by the manufacturer should be described including in vivo data on pressure and stiffness of the final compression system. The pressure exerted on the distal lower leg should be stated in mmHg and the method of pressure determination must be quoted.},

  Abstract                 = {Monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) has been used for decades in the fields of neurosurgery and neurology. There are multiple techniques: invasive as well as noninvasive. This paper aims to provide an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of the most common and well-known methods as well as assess whether noninvasive techniques (transcranial Doppler, tympanic membrane displacement, optic nerve sheath diameter, CT scan/MRI and fundoscopy) can be used as reliable alternatives to the invasive techniques (ventriculostomy and microtransducers). Ventriculostomy is considered the gold standard in terms of accurate measurement of pressure, although microtransducers generally are just as accurate. Both invasive techniques are associated with a minor risk of complications such as hemorrhage and infection. Furthermore, zero drift is a problem with selected microtransducers. The non-invasive techniques are without the invasive methods' risk of complication, but fail to measure ICP accurately enough to be used as routine alternatives to invasive measurement. We conclude that invasive measurement is currently the only option for accurate measurement of ICP.},

  Abstract                 = {Prevalence of cirrhosis among older adults is expected to increase; therefore, we studied the health status, functional disability, and need for supportive care in a large national sample of individuals with cirrhosis. A prospective cohort of individuals with cirrhosis was identified within the longitudinal, nationally representative Health and Retirement Study. Cirrhosis cases were identified in linked Medicare data via ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes and compared to an age-matched cohort without cirrhosis. Two primary outcome domains were assessed: (1) patients' health status (perceived health status, comorbidities, health care utilization, and functional disability as determined by activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living), and (2) informal caregiving (hours of caregiving provided by a primary informal caregiver and associated cost). Adjusted negative binomial regression was used to assess the association between cirrhosis and functional disability. A total of 317 individuals with cirrhosis and 951 age-matched comparators were identified. Relative to the comparison group, individuals with cirrhosis had worse self-reported health status, more comorbidities, and used significantly more health care services (hospitalizations, nursing home stays, physician visits; P < 0.001 for all bivariable comparisons). They also had greater functional disability (P < 0.001 for activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living), despite adjustment for covariates such as comorbidities and health care utilization. Individuals with cirrhosis received more than twice the number of informal caregiving hours per week (P < 0.001), at an annual cost of US $4700 per person. CONCLUSION: Older Americans with cirrhosis have high rates of disability, health care utilization, and need for informal caregiving. Improved care coordination and caregiver support is necessary to optimize management of this frail population.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND. Direct aerosol delivery of aminoglycosides such as tobramycin to the lower airways of patients with cystic fibrosis may control infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and improve pulmonary function, with low systemic toxicity. We conducted a randomized crossover study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aerosolized tobramycin in patients with cystic fibrosis and P. aeruginosa infections. METHODS. Seventy-one patients with stable pulmonary status were recruited from seven U.S. centers for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and randomly assigned to one of two crossover regimens. Group 1 received 600 mg of aerosolized tobramycin for 28 days, followed by half-strength physiologic saline (placebo) for two 28-day period. Group 2 received placebo for 28 days, followed by tobramycin for two 28-day periods. Pulmonary function, the density of P. aeruginosa in sputum, ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and the emergence of tobramycin-resistant P. aeruginosa were monitored. RESULTS. In the first 28-day period, treatment with tobramycin was associated with an increase in the percentage of the value predicted for forced expiratory volume in one second (9.7 percentage points higher than the value for placebo; P < 0.001), forced vital capacity (6.2 percentage points higher than the value for placebo; P = 0.014), and forced expiratory flow at the midportion of the vital capacity (13.0 percentage points higher than the value for placebo; P < 0.001). A decrease in the density of P. aeruginosa in sputum by a factor of 100 (P < 0.001) was found during all periods of tobramycin administration. Neither ototoxicity nor nephrotoxicity was detected. The frequency of the emergence of tobramycin-resistant bacteria was similar during both tobramycin and placebo administration. CONCLUSIONS. The short-term aerosol administration of a high dose of tobramycin in patients with clinically stable cystic fibrosis is an efficacious and safe treatment for endobronchial infection with P. aeruginosa.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We conducted two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of intermittent administration of inhaled tobramycin in patients with cystic fibrosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. A total of 520 patients (mean age, 21 years) were randomly assigned to receive either 300 mg of inhaled tobramycin or placebo twice daily for four weeks, followed by four weeks with no study drug. Patients received treatment or placebo in three on-off cycles for a total of 24 weeks. The end points included pulmonary function, the density of P. aeruginosa in sputum, and hospitalization. RESULTS: The patients treated with inhaled tobramycin had an average increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 10 percent at week 20 as compared with week 0, whereas the patients receiving placebo had a 2 percent decline in FEV1 (P<0.001). In the tobramycin group, the density of P. aeruginosa decreased by an average of 0.8 log10 colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of expectorated sputum from week 0 to week 20, as compared with an increase of 0.3 log10 CFU per gram in the placebo group (P<0.001). The patients in the tobramycin group were 26 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 43 percent) less likely to be hospitalized than those in the placebo group. Inhaled tobramycin was not associated with detectable ototoxic or nephrotoxic effects or with accumulation of the drug in serum. The proportion of patients with P. aeruginosa isolates for which the minimal inhibitory concentration of tobramycin was 8 microg per milliliter or higher increased from 25 percent at week 0 to 32 percent at week 24 in the tobramycin group, as compared with a decrease from 20 percent at week 0 to 17 percent at week 24 in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In a 24-week study of patients with cystic fibrosis, intermittent administration of inhaled tobramycin was well tolerated and improved pulmonary function, decreased the density of P. aeruginosa in sputum, and decreased the risk of hospitalization.},

  Abstract                 = {Record linkage typically involves the use of dedicated linkage units who are supplied with personally identifying information to determine individuals from within and across datasets. The personally identifying information supplied to linkage units is separated from clinical information prior to release by data custodians. While this substantially reduces the risk of disclosure of sensitive information, some residual risks still exist and remain a concern for some custodians. In this paper we trial a method of record linkage which reduces privacy risk still further on large real world administrative data. The method uses encrypted personal identifying information (bloom filters) in a probability-based linkage framework. The privacy preserving linkage method was tested on ten years of New South Wales (NSW) and Western Australian (WA) hospital admissions data, comprising in total over 26 million records. No difference in linkage quality was found when the results were compared to traditional probabilistic methods using full unencrypted personal identifiers. This presents as a possible means of reducing privacy risks related to record linkage in population level research studies. It is hoped that through adaptations of this method or similar privacy preserving methods, risks related to information disclosure can be reduced so that the benefits of linked research taking place can be fully realised.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate a cohort of children undergoing imaging prior to appendectomy in order to identify factors that were associated with undergoing computed tomography (CT) alone as compared to ultrasound (US) alone or US and CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Kids' Inpatient Database was queried for children 1-18 y of age with imaging reported. Logistic regression models identified factors associated with CT-alone imaging modality. RESULTS: There were 6519 patients (69.5%) who underwent CT alone, 2076 (22.1%) who underwent US alone, and 782 (8.4%) who underwent US and CT. The negative appendectomy rates were higher for US alone (6.5%) and US and CT (6.6%) compared to the CT alone group (3.6%, P < 0.001). The perforated appendicitis rates were highest for the US and CT group (36.3%) compared to the CT alone group (31.8%) and the US alone group (29.8%, P = 0.004). Older patients were more likely to undergo CT alone compared to younger patients (odds ratio [OR] 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26-1.64). Girls were less likely to undergo CT alone compared to boys (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.46-0.56). Hospital factors associated with lower CT-alone imaging included children's centers (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.41-0.52), teaching hospitals (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.48-0.60), and urban location (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.32-0.49). CONCLUSIONS: Though patient factors such as age and sex influence imaging use, children's centers are associated with lower CT-alone imaging compared to non-children's centers. As focus increases on limiting CT use in children, opportunities for improvement based on hospital factors exist.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To develop diagnostic guidelines for macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) complicating systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (S-JIA). STUDY DESIGN: We followed the classification criteria approach that is based on the comparison of patients with the index disease with patients with a "confusable" disease. The former group included 74 patients with S-JIA-associated MAS reported in the literature or seen by the authors; the latter group included 37 patients with S-JIA who had 51 instances of "high disease activity" seen by the authors. The relative power of clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic variables in discriminating patients with MAS from patients with high disease activity was evaluated by calculating the sensitivity rate, specificity rate, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). The combinations of variables that led to best separation between patients and control subjects were identified through "the number of criteria present" method. RESULTS: The strongest clinical discriminators were hemorrhages (DOR = 67) and central nervous system dysfunction (DOR = 63); the strongest laboratory discriminators were decreased platelet count (DOR = 1092), increased aspartate aminotransferase (DOR = 247), leukopenia (DOR = 70), and hypofibrinogenemia (DOR = 165). The best separation between patients and control subjects occurred when any 2 or more laboratory criteria (DOR = 1309) were simultaneously present; the second best performance was provided by the presence of any 2, 3, or more clinical and/or laboratory criteria (DOR = 765 and 743, respectively). CONCLUSION: We identified preliminary diagnostic guidelines for MAS complicating S-JIA. These guidelines deserve prospective validation.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Describe the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation as rescue therapy in pediatric patients who experience cardiopulmonary arrest refractory to conventional resuscitation. We report on outcomes and factors associated with survival in children treated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation during cardiopulmonary arrest from the American Heart Association National Registry of CardioPulmonary Resuscitation. DESIGN: Multicentered, national registry of in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. SETTING: Two hundred eighty-five hospitals reporting to the registry from January 2000 to December 2007. PATIENTS: Pediatric patients <18 yrs of age who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation for in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND OUTCOMES: Prearrest and arrest variables were collected. The primary outcome variable was survival to hospital discharge. The secondary outcome was neurologic status after extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation at hospital discharge. Favorable neurologic outcome was defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Categories 1, 2, 3, or no change from admission Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category. RESULTS: Of 6288 pediatric cardiopulmonary arrest events reported, 199 (3.2%) index extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation events were identified; 87 (43.7%) survived to hospital discharge. Fifty-nine survivors had Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category outcomes recorded, and of those, 56 (94.9%) had favorable outcomes. In a multivariable model, the prearrest factor of renal insufficiency and arrest factors of metabolic or electrolyte abnormality and the pharmacologic intervention of sodium bicarbonate/tromethamine were associated with decreased survival. After adjusting for confounding factors, cardiac illness category was associated with an increased survival to hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Forty-four percent of pediatric patients who failed conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation from in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest and who were reported to the National Registry of CardioPulmonary Resuscitation database as treated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation survived to hospital discharge. The majority of survivors with recorded neurologic outcomes were favorable. Patients with cardiac illness category were more likely to survive to hospital discharge after treatment with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be considered for select pediatric patients refractory to conventional in-hospital resuscitation measures.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: Early, accurate diagnosis is fundamental in the management of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The aim of this qualitative review was to compare various criteria of diagnosing VAP in the intensive care unit (ICU) with a special emphasis on the value of clinical diagnosis, microbiological culture techniques, and biomarkers of host response. METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed using the keyword 'ventilator associated pneumonia' AND 'diagnosis'. Our search was limited to human studies published between January 1966 and June 2007. Only studies of at least 25 adult patients were included. Predefined variables were collected, including year of publication, study design (prospective/retrospective), number of patients included, and disease group. RESULTS: Of 572 articles fulfilling the initial search criteria, 159 articles were chosen for detailed review of the full text. A total of 64 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Clinical criteria, used in combination, may be helpful in diagnosing VAP, however, the considerable inter-observer variability and the moderate performance should be taken in account. Bacteriologic data do not increase the accuracy of diagnosis as compared to clinical diagnosis. Quantitative cultures obtained by different methods seem to be rather equivalent in diagnosing VAP. Blood cultures are relatively insensitive to diagnose pneumonia. The rapid availability of cytological data, including inflammatory cells and Gram stains, may be useful in initial therapeutic decisions in patients with suspected VAP. C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells are promising biomarkers in diagnosing VAP. CONCLUSION: An integrated approach should be followed in diagnosing and treating patients with VAP, including early antibiotic therapy and subsequent rectification according to clinical response and results of bacteriologic cultures.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Excess body weight increases both the risk and severity of asthma. Several studies indicate that bariatric surgery decreases asthma severity, but either enrolled few patients or were not focused primarily on asthma. Furthermore, none compared the effects of different bariatric surgical procedures. METHODS: Subjects underwent bariatric surgery at member institutions of the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative between 06/06/2006 and 5/14/2009. Patient records provided data on baseline demographics, asthma medication use, comorbidities, body mass index, type of procedure and perioperative complications. One year later, patients received a follow-up mail survey covering weight and use of asthma medications at that time. RESULTS: Of the 13,057 bariatric surgery patients, 2,562 (18.6%) reported use of asthma medications at baseline. Several comorbidities were significantly more common in asthma patients, who also experienced significantly more perioperative wound and respiratory complications. Among 257 asthma patients who participated in a 1-year follow-up survey, 13 of 28 who had initially used oral corticosteroids for symptom control no longer required them, while use of inhaled corticosteroids decreased from 49.8% to 29.6%. Reduction in intensity of asthma therapy correlated with presence of sleep disorders and extent of weight loss on univariate analysis but not multivariate analysis. Patients who underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), which was associated with less weight loss than other surgical modalities, were significantly less likely to reduce the intensity of their asthma therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery decreases the intensity of medication required to control patients' asthma symptoms, although LAGB appears to produce less significant effects.},

Incidence, mortality, and case-fatality rates were 73.5 per 100 000, 9.3 per 100 000, and 12.8 per 100, respectively. Higher median household incomes and percentages of adult high-school graduates in a patient's census block group correlated with lower incidence. Median length of stay was 2 days. Of those included in the study, 720 patients (74\%) were discharged home with self-care. Three hundred fifty-seven patients met criteria for severe TBI; 346 (97\%) were assigned Glasgow Outcome Scale scores, of which 161 (47\%) had disabilities or died. Severe TBI was associated with nonmetropolitan residence, higher median household income, and certain injury mechanisms. Incidence was similar for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan residents. Median head-region Abbreviated Injury Score, Injury Severity Score, and mortality and case-fatality rates were higher for nonmetropolitan residents.This study reports the lowest incidence of pediatric TBI that results in death or hospitalization to date. One half of severely injured patients suffered poor outcomes.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as well as its influence on in-hospital mortality, resource utilization, and hospital charges. DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study using data from a large US inpatient database. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to an ICU between January 1998 and June 1999 who received mechanical ventilation for > 24 h. MEASUREMENTS: Risk factors for VAP were examined using crude and adjusted odds ratios (AORs). Cases of VAP were matched on duration of mechanical ventilation, severity of illness on admission (predicted mortality), type of admission (medical, surgical, trauma), and age with up to three control subjects. Mortality, resource utilization, and billed hospital charges were then compared between cases and control subjects. RESULTS: Of the 9,080 patients meeting study entry criteria, VAP developed in 842 patients (9.3%). The mean interval between intubation, admission to the ICU, hospital admission, and the identification of VAP was 3.3 days, 4.5 days, and 5.4 days, respectively. Identified independent risk factors for the development of VAP were male gender, trauma admission, and intermediate deciles of underlying illness severity (on admission) [AOR, 1.58, 1.75, and 1.47 to 1.70, respectively]. Patients with VAP were matched with 2,243 control subjects without VAP. Hospital mortality did not differ significantly between cases and matched control subjects (30.5% vs 30.4%, p = 0.713). Nevertheless, patients with VAP had a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation (14.3 +/- 15.5 days vs 4.7 +/- 7.0 days, p < 0.001), ICU stay (11.7 +/- 11.0 days vs 5.6 +/- 6.1 days, p < 0.001), and hospital stay (25.5 +/- 22.8 days vs 14.0 +/- 14.6 days, p < 0.001). Development of VAP was also associated with an increase of > $40,000 USD in mean hospital charges per patient ($104,983 USD +/- $91,080 USD vs $63,689 USD+/- $75,030 USD, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective matched cohort study, the largest of its kind, demonstrates that VAP is a common nosocomial infection that is associated with poor clinical and economic outcomes. While strategies to prevent the occurrence of VAP may not reduce mortality, they may yield other important benefits to patients, their families, and hospital systems.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Cell experiments have found Pim-2 may take part in the tumorigenesis of prostatic carcinoma (PCA). More direct evidences are needed, and the detailed anti-apoptotic mechanism of Pim-2 in PCA cells is still unknown. METHODS: Pim-2 expression levels were compared between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues and PCA tissues using real time PCR and Western blot, respectively. Then Pim-2 expression levels were detected in PCA cell lines DU-145 and LNCaP, as well as in nontumorous prostatic epithelial cell lines RWPE-1 and PNT1a, using real time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The co-expression of Pim-2 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) was examined by immunofluorescence cytochemistry using laser scanning confocal microscope. Finally, Pim-2 SiRNA was transfected into DU-145 cells and Pim-2 was transfected into RWPE-1 cells, and the level of Pim-2 and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (p-eIF4B) were detected, as well as the apoptosis rate. RESULTS: The Pim-2 mRNA and protein level were significantly higher in PCA tissues than those in BPH tissues. The Pim-2 mRNA and protein level in DU-145 and LNCaP cells were significantly higher than those in RWPE-1 and PNT1a cells. Pim-2 and eIF4B could co-express in DU-145 cells. Pim-2 level determined the phosphorylation level of eIF4B and the apoptosis rate of prostatic cells. The higher Pim-2 expressed, the more eIF4B phosphorylated, then the less cell got apoptosis, and vice versa. CONCLUSION: Pim-2 was over-expressed in PCA cell lines and tissues. It may inhibit the apoptosis of PCA cells through phosphorylating eIF4B, thus promote the tumorigenesis of PCA.},

  Abstract                 = {As the largest extant terrestrial animals, elephants do not trot or gallop but can move smoothly to faster speeds without markedly changing their kinematics, yet with a shift from vaulting to bouncing kinetics. To understand this unusual mechanism, we quantified the forelimb and hindlimb motions of eight Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and seven African elephants (Loxodonta africana). We used 240 Hz motion analysis (tracking 10 joint markers) to measure the flexion/extension angles and angular velocities of the limb segments and joints for 288 strides across an eightfold range of speeds (0.6-4.9 m s(-1)) and a sevenfold range of body mass (521-3684 kg). We show that the columnar limb orientation that elephants supposedly exemplify is an oversimplification--few segments or joints are extremely vertical during weight support (especially at faster speeds), and joint flexion during the swing phase is considerable. The 'inflexible' ankle is shown to have potentially spring-like motion, unlike the highly flexible wrist, which ironically is more static during support. Elephants use approximately 31-77% of their maximal joint ranges of motion during rapid locomotion, with this fraction increasing distally in the limbs, a trend observed in some other running animals. All angular velocities decrease with increasing size, whereas smaller elephant limbs are not markedly more flexed than adults. We find no major quantitative differences between African and Asian elephant locomotion but show that elephant limb motions are more similar to those of smaller animals, including humans and horses, than commonly recognized. Such similarities have been obscured by the reliance on the term ;columnar' to differentiate elephant limb posture from that of other animals. Our database will be helpful for identifying elephants with unusual limb movements, facilitating early recognition of musculoskeletal pathology.},

  Abstract                 = {We examined whether elephants shift to using bouncing (i.e. running) mechanics at any speed. To do this, we measured the three-dimensional centre of mass (CM) motions and torso rotations of African and Asian elephants using a novel multisensor method. Hundreds of continuous stride cycles were recorded in the field. African and Asian elephants moved very similarly. Near the mechanically and metabolically optimal speed (a Froude number (Fr) of 0.09), an inverted pendulum mechanism predominated. With increasing speed, the locomotor dynamics quickly but continuously became less like vaulting and more like bouncing. Our mechanical energy analysis of the CM suggests that at a surprisingly slow speed (approx. 2.2 m s(-1), Fr 0.25), the hindlimbs exhibited bouncing, not vaulting, mechanics during weight support. We infer that a gait transition happens at this relatively slow speed: elephants begin using their compliant hindlimbs like pogo sticks to some extent to drive the body, bouncing over their relatively stiff, vaulting forelimbs. Hence, they are not as rigid limbed as typically characterized for graviportal animals, and use regular walking as well as at least one form of running gait.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to characterize epidemiologic trends and cost implications of hospital readmission after treatment of pediatric appendicitis. METHODS: We conducted a 5-year retrospective cohort analysis of 30-day readmission rates for 52,054 patients admitted with appendicitis at 38 children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database. Patients were categorized as "uncomplicated" (postoperative length of stay [LOS] </= 2 days) or "complicated" (LOS >/= 3 days and >/= 4 consecutive days of antibiotics) and analyzed for demographic data, treatment received during the index admission, readmission rates, and excess LOS and hospital-related costs attributable to readmission encounters. RESULTS: The aggregate 30-day readmission rate was 8.7%, and this varied significantly by disease severity and management approach (uncomplicated appendectomy, 5.6%; complicated appendectomy, 12.8%; drainage, 22.6%; antibiotics only, 24.6%; P < .0001). The median hospital cost per case attributable to readmission was $3401 (reflecting a 44% relative increase in cumulative treatment-related cost), and this varied significantly by disease severity and management approach (uncomplicated appendectomy, $1946 [31% relative increase]; complicated appendectomy, $6524 [53% increase]; drainage, $6827 [48% increase]; antibiotics only, $5835 [58% increase]; P < .0001). CONCLUSION: In freestanding children's hospitals, readmission after treatment of pediatric appendicitis is a relatively common and costly occurrence. Collaborative efforts are needed to characterize patient, treatment, and hospital-related risk factors as a basis for developing preventative strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Many physicians believe that the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is useful for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiopulmonary disturbances; however, observational studies suggest that its use may be harmful. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects on outcome of the early use of a PAC in patients with shock mainly of septic origin, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or both. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A multicenter randomized controlled study of 676 patients aged 18 years or older who fulfilled the standard criteria for shock, ARDS, or both conducted in 36 intensive care units in France from January 30, 1999, to June 29, 2001. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to either receive a PAC (n = 335) or not (n = 341). The treatment was left to the discretion of each individual physician. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was mortality at 28 days. The principal secondary end points were day 14 and 90 mortality; day 14 organ system, renal support, and vasoactive agents-free days; hospital, intensive care unit, and mechanical ventilation-free days at day 28. RESULTS: The 2 groups were similar at baseline. There were no significant differences in mortality with or without the PAC at day 14: 49.9% vs 51.3% (mortality relative risk [RR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.13; P =.70); day 28: 59.4% vs 61.0% (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.86-1.10; P =.67); or day 90: 70.7% vs 72.0% (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89-1.08; P =.71). At day 14, the mean (SD) number of days free of organ system failures with or without the PAC (2.3 [3.6] vs 2.4 [3.5]), renal support (7.4 [6.0] vs 7.5 [5.9]), and vasoactive agents (3.8 [4.8] vs 3.9 [4.9]) did not differ. At day 28, mean (SD) days in hospital with or without the PAC (0.9 [3.6] vs 0.9 [3.3]), in the intensive care unit (3.4 [6.8] vs 3.3 [6.9]), or mechanical ventilation use (5.2 [8.5] vs 5.0 [8.5]) did not differ. CONCLUSION: Clinical management involving the early use of a PAC in patients with shock, ARDS, or both did not significantly affect mortality and morbidity.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Instillation of isotonic sodium chloride solution for endotracheal tube suctioning is controversial. Research has focused on the effect of such instillation in adults; no studies in children have been published. OBJECTIVES: (1) To describe differences in oxygen saturation depending on whether or not isotonic sodium chloride solution is instilled during suctioning and (2) to describe the rates of occlusion of endotracheal tubes and nosocomial pneumonia. METHODS: A convenience sample of 24 critically ill patients were enrolled before having suctioning and after informed consent had been given. Ages ranged from 10 weeks to 14 years. Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 groups. In group 1, subjects received between 0.5 and 2.0 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution, depending on their age, once per suctioning episode. In group 2, subjects received no such solution. A total of 104 suctioning episodes were analyzed. Oxygen saturation was recorded at predetermined intervals before and for 10 minutes after suctioning. Occlusion of endotracheal tubes and rates of nosocomial pneumonia also were compared. RESULTS: Patients who had isotonic sodium chloride solution instilled experienced significantly greater oxygen desaturation 1 and 2 minutes after suctioning than did patients who did not. No occlusions of endotracheal tubes and no cases of nosocomial pneumonia occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study support a growing body of evidence that instillation of isotonic sodium chloride solution during endotracheal tube suctioning may not be beneficial and actually may be harmful.},

One such example, the NeoHepatocyte, was previously shown to express a broad panel of hepatocyte-like marker antigens and metabolic activities, both in vitro and following engraftment in the liver of immunodeficient mice. In this report, a refined description of NeoHepatocytes, with regard to their expression of xenobiotic-metabolising enzymes, morphology, hepatocyte marker expression and cell surface phenotype, is presented in comparison with human macrophages in defined states of activation. Contrary to prior assertions, it would seem more likely that NeoHepatocytes express particular hepatocyte-defining genes during a normal programme of macrophage differentiation rather than undergoing a process of transdifferentiation to become hepatocyte-like cells.},

RESULTS: A total of 119 indicators were developed across the domains of general management; family-centered care; cognitive-communication, speech, language, and swallowing impairments; gross and fine motor skill impairments; neuropsychologic, social, and behavioral impairments; school reentry; and community integration. There was a high degree of agreement on these indicators as valid and feasible quality measures for children with TBI. CONCLUSIONS: These indicators are an important step toward building a better base of evidence about the effectiveness and efficiency of the components of acute inpatient rehabilitation for pediatric patients with TBI.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence to 119 newly developed quality-of-care indicators in 7 different domains: general care, family-centered care, cognitive-communication, motor, neuropsychological, school, and community integration. RESULTS: There was substantial variation both within and between institutions in the percentage of patients receiving recommended care in the 7 domains. The lowest scores were found for the school domain. Only 5 institutions scored above 50% for all quality indicators, and only 1 institution scored above 70% overall. Greater adherence to quality indicators was found for facilities with a higher proportion of therapists with pediatric training and for facilities that only admitted children. Patient volume was not associated with adherence to quality indicators. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a tremendous variability and opportunity for improvement in the care of children with TBI.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To examine disability in children and adolescents after traumatic brain injury (TBI) across the spectrum of injury severity. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of children younger than 18 years treated for a TBI (n = 729) or an arm injury (n = 197) between March 1, 2007, and September 30, 2008. The main outcome measures were disability in health-related quality of life, adaptive skills, and participation in social and community activities 3, 12, and 24 months after injury compared with preinjury functioning. RESULTS: The health-related quality of life for children with moderate or severe TBI was lower at all follow-up times compared with baseline, but there was some improvement during the first 2 years after injury. Three months after injury, there was a substantial decrease in the level of activities in which children with moderate and severe TBI were able to participate; these activities improved at 12 and 24 months but were still significantly impaired. Communication and self-care abilities in children with moderate and severe TBI were lower at 3 months than at baseline and did not improve by 24 months. Children who met the definition of mild TBI but had an intracranial hemorrhage had lower quality-of-life scores at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Children with moderate or severe TBI and children with mild TBI who had intracranial hemorrhage had substantial long-term reduction in their quality of life, participation in activities with others, and ability to communicate and care for themselves.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Goal-directed therapy has been used for severe sepsis and septic shock in the intensive care unit. This approach involves adjustments of cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility to balance oxygen delivery with oxygen demand. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients who arrived at an urban emergency department with severe sepsis or septic shock to receive either six hours of early goal-directed therapy or standard therapy (as a control) before admission to the intensive care unit. Clinicians who subsequently assumed the care of the patients were blinded to the treatment assignment. In-hospital mortality (the primary efficacy outcome), end points with respect to resuscitation, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores were obtained serially for 72 hours and compared between the study groups. RESULTS: Of the 263 enrolled patients, 130 were randomly assigned to early goal-directed therapy and 133 to standard therapy; there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to base-line characteristics. In-hospital mortality was 30.5 percent in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy, as compared with 46.5 percent in the group assigned to standard therapy (P = 0.009). During the interval from 7 to 72 hours, the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy had a significantly higher mean (+/-SD) central venous oxygen saturation (70.4+/-10.7 percent vs. 65.3+/-11.4 percent), a lower lactate concentration (3.0+/-4.4 vs. 3.9+/-4.4 mmol per liter), a lower base deficit (2.0+/-6.6 vs. 5.1+/-6.7 mmol per liter), and a higher pH (7.40+/-0.12 vs. 7.36+/-0.12) than the patients assigned to standard therapy (P < or = 0.02 for all comparisons). During the same period, mean APACHE II scores were significantly lower, indicating less severe organ dysfunction, in the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy than in those assigned to standard therapy (13.0+/-6.3 vs. 15.9+/-6.4, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Early goal-directed therapy provides significant benefits with respect to outcome in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been used to treat head injuries for more than 30 years. In 1997, findings of a systematic review suggested that these drugs reduce risk of death by 1-2%. The CRASH trial--a multicentre international collaboration--aimed to confirm or refute such an effect by recruiting 20000 patients. In May, 2004, the data monitoring committee disclosed the unmasked results to the steering committee, which stopped recruitment. METHODS: 10008 adults with head injury and a Glasgow coma score (GCS) of 14 or less within 8 h of injury were randomly allocated 48 h infusion of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) or placebo. Primary outcomes were death within 2 weeks of injury and death or disability at 6 months. Prespecified subgroup analyses were based on injury severity (GCS) at randomisation and on time from injury to randomisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. Effects on outcomes within 2 weeks of randomisation are presented in this report. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN74459797. FINDINGS: Compared with placebo, the risk of death from all causes within 2 weeks was higher in the group allocated corticosteroids (1052 [21.1%] vs 893 [17.9%] deaths; relative risk 1.18 [95% CI 1.09-1.27]; p=0.0001). The relative increase in deaths due to corticosteroids did not differ by injury severity (p=0.22) or time since injury (p=0.05). INTERPRETATION: Our results show there is no reduction in mortality with methylprednisolone in the 2 weeks after head injury. The cause of the rise in risk of death within 2 weeks is unclear.},

  Abstract                 = {Guidelines are available to assist healthcare professionals in the appropriate management of patients with asthma, a highly prevalent and debilitating disease. Despite these guidelines many patients are still not being optimally treated, often resulting in poor asthma control and consequent impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The present study concerns the findings of a multinational survey designed to evaluate the reported level of asthma control and HRQoL of patients with asthma. This analysis focuses on those patients receiving treatment with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) alone. The findings confirm that many patients on a low-dose ICS alone are not receiving appropriate treatment to control their asthma, and this has a marked negative impact on their HRQoL. Revising management and treatment can improve asthma control and HRQoL for these patients, liberating them from the burden of this disease.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine differences in therapies and outcomes among pediatric intensive care units for patients with acute severe asthma. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Eleven pediatric intensive care units participating in the Pediatric Intensive Care Evaluations. PATIENTS: Patients were 1528 children with a primary diagnosis of asthma. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We studied severity of illness, length of stay, and use of invasive interventions. The patients at the centers had similar median physiologic measures of illness and Pediatric Risk of Mortality III scores. The patients received a wide range of invasive interventions depending on institution, including mechanical ventilation (3% to 47%), arterial catheter placement (4% to 46%), central venous catheter (2% to 51%), and determination of a blood gas (24% to 70%). At institutions where mechanical ventilation was used more commonly (>20%, high use), intensive care and hospital stays were longer for asthmatic patients regardless of mechanical ventilation requirement compared with centers with lower use of mechanical ventilation. The status of "high-use center" was an independent predictor for intensive care stay (p = .005) and hospital length of stay (p = .017) as well as duration of mechanical ventilation (p = .014) after adjustment for age, degree of hypercarbia, maximal respiratory rate, use of an arterial catheter, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality III scores among ventilated children. CONCLUSIONS: We found that use of invasive interventions including mechanical ventilation and vascular monitoring varied greatly by institution. Centers with higher use of mechanical ventilation had longer median intensive care stay and hospital stays. Pediatric asthma management for acute severe asthma may be improved by clear elucidation of the institutional practices where fewer invasive interventions were used to achieve better outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Brain injuries are a significant public health problem, particularly among the pediatric population. Brain injuries account for a significant portion of pediatric injury deaths, and are the highest contributor to morbidity and mortality in the pediatric and young adult populations. Several studies focus on particular mechanisms of brain injury and the cost of treating brain injuries, but few studies exist in the literature examining the highest contributing mechanisms to pediatric brain injury and the billed charges associated with them. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) from member hospitals on all patients admitted with diagnosed head injuries and comparisons were made between ICU and non-ICU admissions. Collected data included demographic information, injury information, total billed charges, and patient outcome. RESULTS: Motor vehicle collisions, falls, and assaults/abuse are the three highest contributors to brain injury in terms of total numbers and total billed charges. These three mechanisms of injury account for almost $1 billion in total charges across the five-year period, and account for almost half of the total charges in this dataset over that time period. CONCLUSIONS: Research focusing on brain injury should be tailored to the areas of the most pressing need and the highest contributing factors. While this study is focused on a select number of pediatric hospitals located throughout the country, it identifies significant contributors to head injuries, and the costs associated with treating them.

  Abstract                 = {It is well known that laryngeal instrumentation and endotracheal intubation is associated with a marked, transient rise in intracranial pressure (ICP). Patients with head injury requiring endotracheal intubation are considered particularly at risk from this transient rise in ICP as it reduces cerebral perfusion and thus may increase secondary brain injury. The favoured method for securing a definitive airway in this patient group is by rapid sequence intubation (RSI). In the United States the Emergency Airway Course teaches emergency physicians to routinely administer intravenous lidocaine as a pre treatment for RSI in this patient group in an attempt to attenuate this rise in ICP. A literature search was carried out to identify studies in which intravenous lidocaine was used as a pretreatment for RSI in major head injury. Any link to an improved neurological outcome was also sought. Papers identified were appraised in the manner recommended by the evidence based medicine group to ensure validity. There were no studies identified that answered our question directly and, furthermore, it is our belief that no such study, at present, exists in the literature. Six valid papers were found, which individually contained elements of the question posed and these are presented in a narrative and graphic form. There is currently no evidence to support the use of intravenous lidocaine as a pretreatment for RSI in patients with head injury and its use should only occur in clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) has maintained a comprehensive medical records linkage system for nearly half a century for almost all persons residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Herein, we provide a brief history of the REP before and after 1966, the year in which the REP was officially established. The key protagonists before 1966 were Henry Plummer, Mabel Root, and Joseph Berkson, who developed a medical records linkage system at Mayo Clinic. In 1966, Leonard Kurland established collaborative agreements with other local health care providers (hospitals, physician groups, and clinics [primarily Olmsted Medical Center]) to develop a medical records linkage system that covered the entire population of Olmsted County, and he obtained funding from the National Institutes of Health to support the new system. In 1997, L. Joseph Melton III addressed emerging concerns about the confidentiality of medical record information by introducing a broad patient research authorization as per Minnesota state law. We describe how the key protagonists of the REP have responded to challenges posed by evolving medical knowledge, information technology, and public expectation and policy. In addition, we provide a general description of the system; discuss issues of data quality, reliability, and validity; describe the research team structure; provide information about funding; and compare the REP with other medical information systems. The REP can serve as a model for the development of similar research infrastructures in the United States and worldwide.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND.: Heart failure (HF) accounts for >3 million hospital admissions annually in adults with acquired cardiovascular disease, but there are limited data on HF admissions in adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD). The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that HF admissions are common in ACHD and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. METHODS.: The 2007 Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to assess national prevalence, morbidities, and risk factors for mortality during hospitalizations among ACHD with HF. RESULTS.: Of the 84 308 (95% CI 71 345-97 272) ACHD admissions in the United States in 2007, 17 193 (95% CI 14 157-20 229) had a diagnosis of HF (20%). ACHD with HF was associated with an increased risk of death compared to ACHD without HF (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.6-4.1). On multivariable analysis independent risk factors for mortality included nonoperative intubation (OR 6.1, 95% CI 3.3-11.4), sepsis (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.4-7.4), and acute myocardial infarction (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.8-5.7). Cardiac defects associated with an increased risk of mortality included ventricular septal defects (VSDs) (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.4). CONCLUSIONS.: In this large population-based study, HF-related hospitalizations were common in ACHD and associated with an increased risk of death compared to non-HF admissions. The risk of mortality is increased with the diagnoses of VSDs and the presence of specific comorbidities such as respiratory failure and sepsis.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the characteristics and outcome of transferred trauma patients in a rural setting. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of all trauma admissions to a rural Level I trauma center to examine a 3.5-year (1993-1996) comparison of trauma patients admitted directly with those transferred (RTTP) after being initially stabilized at an outlying hospital. We used prehospital times, Injury Severity Score (ISS), LD50ISS (the ISS at which 50% of patients died), Revised Trauma Score, probability of survival, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, and observed survival as main outcome measures. RESULTS: RTTPs (39.4%) spent an average of 182+/-139 minutes at the outlying hospital and 72+/-42 minutes in transport to the trauma center. Proportionately more head/neck and patients with multiple injuries composed the RTTP group. The RTTP were more severely injured (ISS 11.1+/-8.5; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II 16.2+/-5.8; Revised Trauma Score 7.44+/-1.1) than the trauma patients admitted directly (ISS 7.9+/-5.3; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II 13.1+/-6.3; Revised Trauma Score 7.8+/-0.4; p < 0.05). However, both groups had the same LD50ISS (ISS = 35). When logistic regression was applied with death as the dependent variable, both ISS and age contributed significantly (p = 0.0001) but transfer status did not (p = 0.473). CONCLUSION: Rural trauma centers admit a high percentage of RTTP. These RTTP have a higher injury severity and acuity than their trauma patients admitted directly counterparts. Trauma care in rural areas that involves initial stabilization at outlying hospitals does not adversely affect mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Very low birth weight (VLBW)infants (those with birth weights <1500 g) account for only 1.2% of births but 46% of infant deaths. Large improvements in neonatal technology in the last 2 decades have significantly improved survival prospects for infants with low birth weights, but at a high cost. Due largely to a lack of data, the costs of medical care during the period in which infant mortality is measured (the first year of life), as well as the cost-effectiveness of that care for VLBW infants, have not been quantified. Despite this fact, public policies both toward providing insurance coverage for their care, as well as denying payment for their treatment, have either been proposed or implemented on cost-effectiveness grounds. PATIENTS: The study includes all VLBW single live births in the state of California during 1986 and 1987 that were continuously eligible (through traditional channels) for the state's Medicaid program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment costs were measured for all medical care received during the first year of life, including all inpatient and outpatient care received. The cost-effectiveness of care is measured by aggregate treatment costs for all singleton VLBW liveborns divided by the number of first-year survivors. RESULTS: Average treatment costs per first-year survivor for infants <1500 g was $93 800 (in 1987 constant dollars). Treatment costs per survivor were twice as high for infants <750 g ($273 900) as for the next highest birth weight group 750 to 999 g ($138 800) which was itself almost twice as high as for the 1000 to 1249 g group ($75 100). The gradient in cost-effectiveness with birth weight then drops off to $58 000 per survivor for infants with birth weights between 1250 and 1499 g. CONCLUSION: Public policies aimed at improving birth outcomes by providing insurance coverage for pregnant women and children, such as the recent Medicaid expansions, can potentially be very cost-effective. Although maternal interventions such as prenatal care are relatively inexpensive, each normal birth that results instead in a VLBW birth saves $59 700 in first year medical expenses. However, cost savings attributable to increased birth weights depend on where in the birth weight distribution the increase occurs as well as the size of the birth weight increase. For infants with birth weights >750 g, significant gains can accrue from even a small shift in the birth weight distribution. A shift of 250 g at birth saves an average of $12 000 to $16 000 in first year medical costs and a shift of 500 g generates $28 000 in savings. However, there is a threshold effect on birth weight. For infants <750 g, increases in birth weight may increase medical expenditures. For instance, a shift in birth weight to the 750 to 999 g range increases costs by $29 000.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Guidelines regarding arterial cannula site and cannula site-specific risks of central nervous system (CNS) injury for pediatric patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support are lacking. We reviewed cannulation trends for pediatric respiratory failure and evaluated CNS complication rates by cannulation site and mode of support. METHODS: The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry was queried for all pediatric respiratory failure patients <18 years treated from 1993-2007. The primary outcome was radiographic evidence of CNS injury. RESULTS: Venoarterial (VA) support was used in 62% of 2617 ECMO runs. The carotid artery was used in 93% of VA patients. Femoral artery use increased in patients >5 years of age and >20 kg. Venovenous (VV) ECMO was used in >50% of children >10 years. No significant difference was identified in CNS injury between carotid and femoral cannulation in any age group but the femoral group was small (4.4%). VA support was independently associated with increased odds of CNS injury compared to VV cannulation (OR, 1.6). CONCLUSION: VA ECMO is the most common mode of support in pediatric respiratory failure patients. Although no significant difference in CNS injury was noted between carotid and femoral artery cannulation, the odds of injury were significantly higher than VV support.},

This paper compares information on comorbidity obtained from hospital discharge abstracts for patients undergoing prostatectomy or cholecystectomy at a Winnipeg teaching hospital with clinical data on preoperative medical conditions prospectively collected during an Anesthesia Follow-up study. The diagnostic information on cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and metabolic disorders showed considerable agreement, ranging from 65 to over 90% correspondence across the two data sets. Certain conditions noted by the anesthesiologist were often absent from the claims data; cardiovascular disease was recorded in the clinical data but absent from the claims for 31% of prostatectomy and 17% of cholecystectomy cases. Such patients were less likely to have been assigned a high score on the ASA Physical Status measure or to have high-risk diagnoses on the hospital file. Similar findings resulted from comparing the two sources in their ability to predict such adverse outcomes as mortality and readmission to hospital: the anesthesia file generally included less serious comorbidity.},

  Abstract                 = {Record linkage techniques can help identify the same patient for matching diverse files (hospital discharge abstracts, insurance claims, registries, Vital Statistics data) which contain similar identifiers. Prior knowledge of whether a linkage is feasible is important to prevent wasted effort (additional data collection or data manipulation), which decreases the cost-effectiveness of the linkage. Using examples generated by linking the Manitoba Health Services Commission data with Vital Statistic files, a method of estimating the information in each data set is presented first. Further, the feasibility of several different record linkage strategies is described and tested, given varying amounts of information. At the margin, relatively small amounts of information (having just one more variable to match with) can make a great difference. Probabilistic linkage's great advantage was found in those situations where only a moderate amount of extra information was available. By using the above techniques when working with one or both files in a proposed record linkage project, a much more informed judgement can now be made as to whether a linkage will or will not work. In facilitating record linkage, flexibility of both software and the strategy for matching is very important.},

  Abstract                 = {Prognostic models for outcome prediction in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are important instruments in both clinical practice and research. To remain current a continuous process of model validation is necessary. We aimed to investigate the performance of the International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) prognostic models in predicting mortality in a contemporary New York State TBI registry developed and maintained by the Brain Trauma Foundation. The Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) TBI-trac(R) database contains data on 3125 patients who sustained severe TBI (GCS </=8) in New York State between 2000 and 2009. Outcome measure was 14-day mortality. To predict 14-day mortality with admission data, we adapted the IMPACT Core and Extended models. Performance of the models was assessed by determining calibration (agreement between observed and predicted outcomes) and discrimination (separation of those patients who die from those who survive). Calibration was explored graphically with calibration plots. Discrimination was expressed by the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). A total of 2513 out of 3125 patients in the BTF database met the inclusion criteria. The 14-day mortality rate was 23%. The models showed excellent calibration. Mean predicted probabilities were 20% for the Core model and 24% for the Extended model. Both models showed good discrimination with AUCs of 0.79 (Core) and 0.83 (Extended). We conclude that the IMPACT models validly predict 14-day mortality in the BTF database, confirming generalizability of these models for outcome prediction in TBI patients.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: In clinical trials, ordinal outcome measures are often dichotomized into two categories. In traumatic brain injury (TBI) the 5-point Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) is collapsed into unfavourable versus favourable outcome. Simulation studies have shown that exploiting the ordinal nature of the GOS increases chances of detecting treatment effects. The objective of this study is to quantify the benefits of ordinal analysis in the real-life situation of a large TBI trial. METHODS: We used data from the CRASH trial that investigated the efficacy of corticosteroids in TBI patients (n = 9,554). We applied two techniques for ordinal analysis: proportional odds analysis and the sliding dichotomy approach, where the GOS is dichotomized at different cut-offs according to baseline prognostic risk. These approaches were compared to dichotomous analysis. The information density in each analysis was indicated by a Wald statistic. All analyses were adjusted for baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Dichotomous analysis of the six-month GOS showed a non-significant treatment effect (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.21, P = 0.096). Ordinal analysis with proportional odds regression or sliding dichotomy showed highly statistically significant treatment effects (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.25, P = 0.0007 and 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.30, P = 0.0002), with 2.05-fold and 2.56-fold higher information density compared to the dichotomous approach respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the CRASH trial data confirmed that ordinal analysis of outcome substantially increases statistical power. We expect these results to hold for other fields of critical care medicine that use ordinal outcome measures and recommend that future trials adopt ordinal analyses. This will permit detection of smaller treatment effects.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Heterogeneity of patients is a common problem in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in various fields of clinical research. We aimed to investigate the potential benefits of different approaches for dealing with heterogeneity in a case study on traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN AND SETTING: Statistical modeling studies in three surveys and six randomized controlled trials. PATIENTS: Individual patient data (n = 8033) from the IMPACT database. INTERVENTIONS: We investigated the statistical power and efficiency of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in relation to (1) selection according to baseline characteristics, (2) prognostic targeting (i.e., excluding those with a relatively extreme prognosis), and (3) covariate-adjusted analysis. Statistical power was expressed as the required sample size for obtaining 80% power and efficiency as the relative change in study duration, reflecting both gains in power and adverse effects on recruitment. Uniform and targeted treatment effects were simulated for 6 month unfavorable outcome. RESULTS: For a uniform treatment effect, selection resulted ina sample size reduction of 33% in the surveys and 5% in the RCTs, but decreased recruitment by 65% and 41%, respectively. Hence, the relative study duration was prolonged (surveys: 95%; RCTs: 60%). Prognostic targeting resulted in sample size reductions of 28% and 17%, and increased relative study duration by 5% in surveys and 11% in the RCTs. Covariate adjustment reduced sample sizes by 30% and 16%, respectively, and did not affect recruitment. For a targeted treatment effect, the sample size reductions by selection (surveys: 47%; RCTs: 20%) and prognostic targeting (surveys: 49%; RCTs: 41%) were larger and adverse effects on recruitment smaller. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of selection and prognostic targeting in terms of statistical power are reversed by adverse effects on recruitment. Covariate adjusted analysis in a broadly selected group of patients is advisable if a uniform treatment effect is assumed, since there is no decrease in recruitment.},

  Abstract                 = {Substantial heterogeneity exists among patients who suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI). Strict enrollment criteria may diminish heterogeneity in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but will also decrease recruitment and may affect the outcome distribution. The aim of this study was to investigate the influences of commonly used enrollment criteria for RCTs in TBI on potential recruitment and on outcome distribution. We used individual patient data from the International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) database, including six therapeutic phase III RCTs (n = 5816) and three surveys (n = 2217) in TBI. The primary outcome was the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 6 months after injury, which we dichotomized as favorable/unfavorable. We investigated the influences of commonly used enrollment criteria on recruitment and outcome distribution: time window between injury and admission to study hospital <or= 8 h; age at injury <or= 65 years; >or= 1 reactive pupil; motor score > 1; Glasgow Coma Scale <or= 8. Application of all enrollment criteria resulted in a large reduction of recruitment in both the surveys (up to 65%) and the RCTs (up to 41%). Among the remaining patients, fewer had an unfavorable outcome in both the surveys (original, 60%; remaining, 44%) and the RCTs (original, 43%; remaining, 38%). Applying these enrollment criteria to patients from the surveys resulted in an outcome distribution that approximated the outcome observed in the RCTs. The use of strict enrollment criteria leads to substantial reductions in the recruitment of RCTs in TBI. The outcome in TBI studies depends strongly on the enrollment criteria.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Few data exist on prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of pediatric heart failure hospitalizations. We tested the hypotheses that pediatric heart failure-related hospitalizations increased over time but that mortality decreased. Factors associated with mortality and length of stay were also assessed. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database was performed for pediatric (age </=18 years) heart failure-related hospitalizations for the years 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006. Hospitalizations did not significantly increase over time, ranging from 11,153 (95% confidence interval [CI] 8,898-13,409) in 2003 to 13,892 (95% CI 11,528-16,256) in 2006. Hospital length of stay increased from 1997 (mean 13.8 days, 95% CI 12.5-15.2) to 2006 (mean 19.4 days, 95% CI 18.2 to 20.6). Hospital mortality was 7.3% (95% CI 6.9-8.0) and did not vary significantly between years; however, risk-adjusted mortality was less in 2006 (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.80). The greatest risk of mortality occurred with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, acute renal failure, and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Heart failure-related hospitalizations occur in 11,000-14,000 children annually in the United States, with an overall mortality of 7%. Many comorbid conditions influenced hospital mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {Pneumonia is the most common cause of death from infectious disease in the western hemisphere. Pathophysiological and protective processes are initiated by pattern recognition of microbial structures. To provide the molecular framework for a better understanding of processes relevant to host defence in pneumonia, we performed pulmonary transcriptome analysis in mice infected with the major bacterial and viral agents of community-acquired pneumonia, Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza A virus. We detected differential expression of 1300 genes after infection with either pathogen. Of these, approximately 36% or 30% were specific for pneumococcal or influenza infection, respectively, yielding pathogen-specific as well as shared inflammatory transcriptional signatures. These results not only reveal a differential response on the cytokine and chemokine levels but also emphasize the important role of genes implicated in regulation and fine tuning of inflammation. As one, albeit unexpected, key feature of pneumococcal pneumonia we discovered down-regulation of B-cell responses, probably reflecting a pneumococcal virulence strategy. The pathophysiological consequences of influenza A virus infection were reflected by the emerging protective T-cell response and differential induction of genes involved in tissue regeneration and proliferation. These data provide new insights into pathogenesis of the most common forms of pneumonia, highlighting the value of transcriptional profiling for the elucidation of underlying mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of intratracheal colistin in preventing nosocomial bronchopneumonia (BPN) in the critically ill. DESIGN: Study evaluating the clinical incidence of nosocomial BPN in 2 groups of critically ill patients who receive or did not receive intratracheal colistin. BPN was assessed clinically in survivors and histologically in non-survivors. SETTING: A 14-bed surgical intensive care unit. PATIENTS: 598 consecutive critically ill patients were studied during a prospective non-randomized study over a 40-month period. INTERVENTIONS: 251 patients--31 non-survivors and 220 survivors--did not receive intratracheal colistin and 347-42 non-survivors and 305 survivors--received intratracheal colistin for a 2-week period (1,600,000 units per 24 h). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The incidence of nosocomial BPN was evaluated clinically in survivors, using repeated protected minibronchoalveolar lavages, and histologically in non-survivors via an immediate postmortem pneumonectomy (histologic and semi-quantitative bacteriologic analysis of one lung). The clinical incidence of nosocomial BPN was of 37% in coli (-) survivors and of 27% in coli (+) survivors (p < 0.01). This result was histologically confirmed in non-survivors, where the incidence of histologic BPN was of 61% in coli (-) patients and of 36% in coli (+) patients (p < 0.001). Emergence of BPN due to colistin-resistant micro-organisms was not observed. Because colistin was successful in preventing Gram-negative BPN and did not change the absolute number of Gram-positive BPN, the proportion of BPN caused by staphylococcus species was higher in group coli (+) patients (33% vs 16%). Mortality was not significantly influenced by the administration of colistin. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the administration of intratracheal colistin during a 2-week period significantly reduces the incidence of Gram-negative BPN without creating an increasing number of BPN due to colistin-resistant micro-organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose:To evaluate the 15-year trend in the use of computed tomography (CT) in hospitalized pediatric trauma patients admitted to Harborview Medical Center (HMC) from 1996 to 2010.Materials and Methods:This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. The requirement for informed consent was waived. The HMC trauma registry was linked to the billing department data, and patient and injury-related characteristics were extracted, in addition to type and frequency of CT procedures. Patients discharged from the emergency department and patients hospitalized for less than 24 hours were not included in this study. Patients were classified into three categories according to age: 0-14 years, 15-18 years, and 19-54 years (reference group). Multivariate negative binomial regression was used to compare CT usage among different age groups by adjusting for patient sex, race and/or ethnicity, insurance status, mechanism of injury, injury severity, final disposition (dead vs alive), and year of admission. The trend for CT use in children and teenagers was also evaluated.Results:A total of 64 425 trauma patients 0-54 years of age were admitted during the study period. Compared with CT usage in adults 19-54 years old, usage in children up to 15 years of age was significantly lower for spine (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85, 0.92), maxillofacial (IRR, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.97), and thoracic (IRR, 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.99) CT. Increased use of head CT was observed in children up to 15 years old (IRR, 1.09; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.13) and 15-18 years old (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.13). From 2008 to 2010, usage rates in children up to 15 years old and 15-18 years old was relatively unchanged or slightly decreased for almost all CT types.Conclusion:A decreasing or unchanged trend was observed in CT usage in hospitalized pediatric trauma patients in recent years.(c) RSNA, 2013.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of many analyses of large databases is to draw causal inferences about the effects of actions, treatments, or interventions. Examples include the effects of various options available to a physician for treating a particular patient, the relative efficacies of various health care providers, and the consequences of implementing a new national health care policy. A complication of using large databases to achieve such aims is that their data are almost always observational rather than experimental. That is, the data in most large data sets are not based on the results of carefully conducted randomized clinical trials, but rather represent data collected through the observation of systems as they operate in normal practice without any interventions implemented by randomized assignment rules. Such data are relatively inexpensive to obtain, however, and often do represent the spectrum of medical practice better than the settings of randomized experiments. Consequently, it is sensible to try to estimate the effects of treatments from such large data sets, even if only to help design a new randomized experiment or shed light on the generalizability of results from existing randomized experiments. However, standard methods of analysis using available statistical software (such as linear or logistic regression) can be deceptive for these objectives because they provide no warnings about their propriety. Propensity score methods are more reliable tools for addressing such objectives because the assumptions needed to make their answers appropriate are more assessable and transparent to the investigator.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To review mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction in general and intrinsic myocardial depression in particular. DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE database. DATA SYNTHESIS: Myocardial depression is a well-recognized manifestation of organ dysfunction in sepsis. Due to the lack of a generally accepted definition and the absence of large epidemiologic studies, its frequency is uncertain. Echocardiographic studies suggest that 40% to 50% of patients with prolonged septic shock develop myocardial depression, as defined by a reduced ejection fraction. Sepsis-related changes in circulating volume and vessel tone inevitably affect cardiac performance. Although the coronary circulation during sepsis is maintained or even increased, alterations in the microcirculation are likely. Mitochondrial dysfunction, another feature of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, will also place the cardiomyocytes at risk of adenosine triphosphate depletion. However, clinical studies have demonstrated that myocardial cell death is rare and that cardiac function is fully reversible in survivors. Hence, functional rather than structural changes seem to be responsible for intrinsic myocardial depression during sepsis. The underlying mechanisms include down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, depressed postreceptor signaling pathways, impaired calcium liberation from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and impaired electromechanical coupling at the myofibrillar level. Most, if not all, of these changes are regulated by cytokines and nitric oxide. CONCLUSIONS: Integrative studies are needed to distinguish the hierarchy of the various mechanisms underlying septic cardiac dysfunction. As many of these changes are related to severe inflammation and not to infection per se, a better understanding of septic myocardial dysfunction may be usefully extended to other systemic inflammatory conditions encountered in the critically ill. Myocardial depression may be arguably viewed as an adaptive event by reducing energy expenditure in a situation when energy generation is limited, thereby preventing activation of cell death pathways and allowing the potential for full functional recovery.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the complications and risk factors for complications associated with using central venous catheters (CVCs) for the treatment of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2003, with a diagnosis of AHO. RESULTS: Eighty patients with AHO met inclusion criteria. The median age was 5 years, and 66% of the patients were male. The most commonly affected bones were the femur (25%), tibia (20%), and pelvis (16%). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism identified from cultures of bone (67%) and blood (30%). Seventy-five patients (94%) received >2 weeks of intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy via a CVC and 5 (6%) received <2 weeks of IV antibiotic therapy before conversion to oral therapy for a median of 25 days. None of the patients who switched to oral therapy within 2 weeks was rehospitalized or returned to the emergency department. Of the 75 patients who received >2 weeks of IV therapy, 41% had > or =1 CVC-associated complication. Seventeen patients (23%) had a CVC malfunction or displacement, 8 (11%) had a catheter-associated bloodstream infection, 8 (11%) had fever with negative blood culture results, and 4 (5%) had a local skin infection at the site of catheter insertion. Older age was protective against the development of a CVC-associated complication, whereas the lowest median household income was associated with development of a CVC-associated complication. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to reduce CVC-associated complications should be developed and evaluated, particularly for young children and those from families with low household incomes. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral antibiotic therapy after a short course of IV therapy as an alternative to prolonged IV therapy.},

It is unknown if truncal insufficiency requiring truncal valve surgery (TVS) at the time of primary CAT repair impacts outcome. METHODS: Patients in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database undergoing CAT repair from 2000 to 2009 were included. Outcomes were compared for patients with and without TVS at the time of CAT repair and were further stratified by interrupted aortic arch (IAA) repair. RESULTS: Of 572 patients (63 centers), median age at surgery was 12 days (interquartile range, 6 to 34). Twenty-three patients underwent concomitant TVS (n = 22 repair, n = 1 replacement) during CAT repair, and 4 patients underwent TVS later during the same hospitalization (n = 1 repair, n = 3 replacement). Thirty-nine patients underwent IAA repair at the time of CAT repair, 5 of whom had concomitant TVS. Mortality for CAT repair with TVS versus isolated CAT repair was 30% versus 10% (p = 0.0002). All 4 patients who required TVS later during the admission died. Truncal valve surgery was associated with increased mortality among CAT patients both with and without IAA repair, with the highest mortality (60%) among CAT patients undergoing IAA repair and TVS (n = 5). Common arterial trunk plus TVS had an increased risk of mechanical support and a longer hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Truncal valve surgery in patients undergoing CAT repair is associated with significant mortality. Repair of IAA and TVS at the time of CAT repair carries particularly high risk. Failure to address significant truncal insufficiency, necessitating early reoperation with TVS, had uniformly poor outcomes.},

METHODS: Data were obtained from 13 states funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct TBI surveillance from 1997 to 1999. Rates by race and by cause were calculated for the 13 states combined. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels and PE use were compared between AI/AN and "other" races in a subgroup of these states. RESULTS: Although not significantly different, AI/AN had the highest overall age-adjusted TBI hospitalization rate (71.5 per 100,000). Rates were significantly higher among AI/AN than among whites for ages 20 to 44 years (78.5 per 100,000 vs 54.7 per 100,000, P < .0001). MV incidents were the leading cause of TBI (40.1% of cases) among AI/AN, and AI/AN injured in MV incidents had higher BAC levels (65.7% > or = 0.08 g/dL vs 31.6% > or = 0.08 g/dL, P < .0001) and lower PE use (22.0% vs 40.4%, P < .0001) than the "other" race group. CONCLUSION: AI/AN have high rates of TBI hospitalization compared with other races. High BAC levels and low use of PE in MV incidents appear to be associated with the higher rates in this population.},

  Abstract                 = {The heterogeneity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered one of the most significant barriers to finding effective therapeutic interventions. In October, 2007, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, with support from the Brain Injury Association of America, the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, and the National Institute of Disability and Rehabilitation Research, convened a workshop to outline the steps needed to develop a reliable, efficient and valid classification system for TBI that could be used to link specific patterns of brain and neurovascular injury with appropriate therapeutic interventions. Currently, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is the primary selection criterion for inclusion in most TBI clinical trials. While the GCS is extremely useful in the clinical management and prognosis of TBI, it does not provide specific information about the pathophysiologic mechanisms which are responsible for neurological deficits and targeted by interventions. On the premise that brain injuries with similar pathoanatomic features are likely to share common pathophysiologic mechanisms, participants proposed that a new, multidimensional classification system should be developed for TBI clinical trials. It was agreed that preclinical models were vital in establishing pathophysiologic mechanisms relevant to specific pathoanatomic types of TBI and verifying that a given therapeutic approach improves outcome in these targeted TBI types. In a clinical trial, patients with the targeted pathoanatomic injury type would be selected using an initial diagnostic entry criterion, including their severity of injury. Coexisting brain injury types would be identified and multivariate prognostic modeling used for refinement of inclusion/exclusion criteria and patient stratification. Outcome assessment would utilize endpoints relevant to the targeted injury type. Advantages and disadvantages of currently available diagnostic, monitoring, and assessment tools were discussed. Recommendations were made for enhancing the utility of available or emerging tools in order to facilitate implementation of a pathoanatomic classification approach for clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop an intensive care unit research database applying automated techniques to aggregate high-resolution diagnostic and therapeutic data from a large, diverse population of adult intensive care unit patients. This freely available database is intended to support epidemiologic research in critical care medicine and serve as a resource to evaluate new clinical decision support and monitoring algorithms. DESIGN: Data collection and retrospective analysis. SETTING: All adult intensive care units (medical intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, cardiac surgery recovery unit) at a tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database consists of 25,328 intensive care unit stays. The investigators collected detailed information about intensive care unit patient stays, including laboratory data, therapeutic intervention profiles such as vasoactive medication drip rates and ventilator settings, nursing progress notes, discharge summaries, radiology reports, provider order entry data, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, and, for a subset of patients, high-resolution vital sign trends and waveforms. Data were automatically deidentified to comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards and integrated with relational database software to create electronic intensive care unit records for each patient stay. The data were made freely available in February 2010 through the Internet along with a detailed user's guide and an assortment of data processing tools. The overall hospital mortality rate was 11.7%, which varied by critical care unit. The median intensive care unit length of stay was 2.2 days (interquartile range, 1.1-4.4 days). According to the primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, the following disease categories each comprised at least 5% of the case records: diseases of the circulatory system (39.1%); trauma (10.2%); diseases of the digestive system (9.7%); pulmonary diseases (9.0%); infectious diseases (7.0%); and neoplasms (6.8%). CONCLUSIONS: MIMIC-II documents a diverse and very large population of intensive care unit patient stays and contains comprehensive and detailed clinical data, including physiological waveforms and minute-by-minute trends for a subset of records. It establishes a new public-access resource for critical care research, supporting a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule development, and electronic tool development.},

It includes such activities as analysis, research, quality and safety measurement, public health, payment, provider certification or accreditation, marketing, and other business applications, including strictly commercial activities. Secondary use of health data can enhance health care experiences for individuals, expand knowledge about disease and appropriate treatments, strengthen understanding about effectiveness and efficiency of health care systems, support public health and security goals, and aid businesses in meeting customers' needs. Yet, complex ethical, political, technical, and social issues surround the secondary use of health data. While not new, these issues play increasingly critical and complex roles given current public and private sector activities not only expanding health data volume, but also improving access to data. Lack of coherent policies and standard "good practices" for secondary use of health data impedes efforts to strengthen the U.S. health care system. The nation requires a framework for the secondary use of health data with a robust infrastructure of policies, standards, and best practices. Such a framework can guide and facilitate widespread collection, storage, aggregation, linkage, and transmission of health data. The framework will provide appropriate protections for legitimate secondary use.},

Less than half of the respondents reported actual prehospital use of IO infusions in pediatric patients, and an additional third indicated that they were unaware of any future plans for introducing the technique into EMS practice. This study's documentation of the current limited prehospital use of intraosseous infusions indicates a need for concerted efforts to promote broad adoption and continued evaluation of the IO technique in prehospital pediatric emergency care. Suggestions to enhance adoption include increased utilization of existing successful IO teaching approaches, development of national EMS standards regarding intraosseous infusions, active involvement of EMS regulatory agencies for widespread practice changes, and consistent quality assurance activities.},

We conducted a face-to-face survey of 122 general surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and anesthesiologists in three hospitals to evaluate the influence of several clinical and nonclinical factors on transfusion decision making. We found widespread deficiencies in physicians' knowledge of transfusion risks and indications. Each transfusion risk was estimated correctly by fewer than half of the physicians surveyed, and only 31% responded correctly to a set of four questions regarding transfusion indications. Attending physicians routinely had lower knowledge scores than did residents, yet they exhibited more confidence in their knowledge. Residents' transfusion decisions, however, were strongly influenced by the desires of their attending physicians, resulting in their ordering potentially inappropriate transfusions. Of the residents surveyed, 61% indicated that they ordered transfusions that they judged unnecessary at least once a month because a more senior physician suggested that they do so. These findings provide insights for the development of strategies to improve transfusion practices, which would address the dual concerns of quality of care and cost containment.},

  Abstract                 = {Very little research regarding standard treatments for pediatric traumatic brain injury (PTBI) exists. The objective of this study was to examine the use of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring devices in PTBI and to determine if its use was associated with any outcome benefit. Data were collected from the Trauma Registry over an 11-year period (1996-2006) on all blunt trauma pediatric patients (age < 14 years) with an initial Glasgow Coma Scale score < or =8. Data collected included: demographics, admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score, Abbreviated Injury Score, and use of an ICP monitor. Outcome measures included: mortality, complications, discharge location, and capacity. Thirty-three (25%) of 129 blunt PTBI patients had ICP monitors placed. Patients with monitors were more severely injured overall (Injury Severity Score: 25 vs. 18, P = 0.001) and had more severe head injury (81% head Abbreviated Injury Score > 3 vs. 55%, P = 0.01) than patients without monitors. However, there was no difference in mortality (28% vs. 35%, P = 0.52), discharge location (P = 0.10), and discharge capacity (P = 0.84). After multivariable analysis to adjust for the differences between the two study groups, the use of ICP monitor provided no survival benefit (adjusted odds ratio: 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3-4.1; adjusted P value = 0.85). The use of ICP monitor was, however, independently associated with a higher risk of developing extracranial complications (adjusted odds ratio: 4.3; 95% CI: 1.2-16.4; adjusted P value = 0.025). In conclusion, the use of ICP monitors in pediatric patients with severe isolated head injury provided no survival benefit and was associated with an increased risk of complications.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A prospective case-control study was conducted in a tertiary care pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) to evaluate the use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for the detection of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in children. Subjects 0-14 years of age who had a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head performed as part of clinical care were eligible for enrollment. The children were stratified into two groups based on whether the CT was normal or abnormal. Children in the abnormal imaging cohort were further divided into those with ICH and those with other abnormalities of the brain parenchyma (contusions, diffuse axonal injury [DAI], or cerebral edema) or fractures. NIRS measurements were performed on all subjects within 24 h of head CT. The NIRS operator was blinded to the presence or absence of ICH. NIRS measurements were performed in eight different scalp locations (four bilaterally). A total of 103 measurements were made. The optical density (OD) was automatically calculated by comparing the reflected and diffused optical signal. A DeltaOD>0.2 between hemispheres in any scalp location was considered abnormal. NIRS was performed in a total of 28 subjects: 7 had normal imaging and 21 had abnormal imaging. Of those with abnormal imaging, 12 had ICH. The sensitivity and specificity of NIRS at detecting ICH was 1.0 and 0.8, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 0.8 and 1.0, respectively. In conclusion, NIRS correctly identified all cases of ICH in this pilot study. Our preliminary results suggest that NIRS may be beneficial in the evaluation of a child with possible ICH.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to compare the outcome of severely injured patients who were transported directly to a Level I, tertiary trauma center with those who were transferred after being first transported to less specialized hospitals. METHODS: The data were based on all patients treated at three tertiary trauma centers in Quebec between April 1, 1993, and December 31, 1995. There were 1,608 patients (37%) transferred and 2,756 patients (63%) transported directly. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was approximately 45 years, and more than 60% were males. The predominant mechanisms of injury were falls and motor vehicle crashes. The transfer and direct transport groups were similar with respect to age, gender, and mechanism of injury. Body regions injured were also similar with the exception of head or neck injuries (transfer, 56%; direct, 28%; p < 0.0001). The mean Injury Severity Score was 14, the mean Pre-Hospital Index score was 5.5, and the mean Revised Trauma Score was 7.5. The two groups were similar with respect to these injury severity measures. The primary outcome of interest was mortality described as overall death rate, death rate in the emergency room, and death rate after admission. Other outcomes studied were hospital length of stay and duration of treatment in an intensive care unit. When compared with the direct transport group, transferred patients were at increased risk for overall mortality (transfer, 8.9%; direct, 4.8%; odds ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.53-2.50), emergency room mortality (transfer, 3.4%; direct, 1.2%; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI = 1.90-4.6), and mortality after admission (transfer, 5.5%; direct, 3.6%; odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI = 1.17-2.11). All of these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.003). Stratified and multiple logistic regression analysis did not alter these results and failed to identify a patient subgroup for which transfer was associated with a reduced risk of mortality. After adjusting for patient age, Injury Severity Score, and presence of injuries to the head or neck and extremities, transferred patients stayed significantly longer in the hospital and the intensive care unit as indicated by the mean length of stay (transfer, 16.0 days; direct, 13.2 days; p = 0.02) and the mean intensive care unit stay (transfer, 2.0 days; direct, 0.95 days; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study have shown that transportation of severely injured patients from the scene directly to Level I trauma centers is associated with a reduction in mortality and morbidity. Further studies are required for the evaluation of transport protocols for rural trauma. Economic and cost-effectiveness considerations of patient triage are also essential.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are less common causes of cardiac arrest in children than in adults. These tachyarrhythmias can also begin during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), presumably as reperfusion arrhythmias. We determined whether the outcome is better for initial than for subsequent ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia. METHODS: All cardiac arrests in persons under 18 years of age were identified from a large, multicenter, in-hospital cardiac-arrest registry. The results from children with initial ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia, children in whom ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia developed during CPR, and children with no ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia were compared by chi-square and multivariable logistic-regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 1005 index patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, 272 (27 percent) had documented ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia during the arrest. In 104 patients (10 percent), ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia was the initial pulseless rhythm; in 149 patients (15 percent), it developed during the arrest. The time of initiation of ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia was not documented in 19 patients. Thirty-five percent of patients with initial ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia survived to hospital discharge, as compared with 11 percent of patients with subsequent ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia (odds ratio, 2.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 5.8). Twenty-seven percent of patients with no ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia survived to hospital discharge, as compared with 11 percent of patients with subsequent ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia (odds ratio, 3.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 7.6). CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests, survival outcomes were highest among patients in whom ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia was present initially than among those in whom it developed subsequently. The outcomes for patients with subsequent ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia were substantially worse than those for patients with asystole or pulseless electrical activity.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Some observational studies suggest that the use of pulmonary-artery catheters to guide therapy is associated with increased mortality. METHODS: We performed a randomized trial comparing goal-directed therapy guided by a pulmonary-artery catheter with standard care without the use of a pulmonary-artery catheter. The subjects were high-risk patients 60 years of age or older, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class III or IV risk, who were scheduled for urgent or elective major surgery, followed by a stay in an intensive care unit. Outcomes were adjudicated by observers who were unaware of the treatment-group assignments. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality from any cause. RESULTS: Of 3803 eligible patients, 1994 (52.4 percent) underwent randomization. The base-line characteristics of the two treatment groups were similar. A total of 77 of 997 patients who underwent surgery without the use of a pulmonary-artery catheter (7.7 percent) died in the hospital, as compared with 78 of 997 patients in whom a pulmonary-artery catheter was used (7.8 percent)--a difference of 0.1 percentage point (95 percent confidence interval, -2.3 to 2.5). There was a higher rate of pulmonary embolism in the catheter group than in the standard-care group (8 events vs. 0 events, P=0.004). The survival rates at 6 months among patients in the standard-care and catheter groups were 88.1 and 87.4 percent, respectively (difference, -0.7 percentage point [95 percent confidence interval, -3.6 to 2.2]; negative survival differences favor standard care); at 12 months, the rates were 83.9 and 83.0 percent, respectively (difference, -0.9 percentage point [95 percent confidence interval, -4.3 to 2.4]). The median hospital stay was 10 days in each group.

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of outcome in pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) present significant challenges to the treating clinician. Clinical and radiological tools for assessing injury severity and predicting outcome, in particular, lack sensitivity and specificity. In patients with mild TBI, often there is uncertainty about which patients should undergo radiological imaging and who is at risk for long term neurological sequelae. In severe TBI, often there is uncertainty about which patients will experience secondary insults and what the outcome for individual patients will be. In several other clinical specialties, biomarkers are used to diagnose disease, direct treatment, and prognosticate. However, an ideal biomarker for brain injury has not been found. METHODS: In this review, we examine the various factors that must be taken into account in the search for a reliable biomarker in brain injury. We review the important studies that have investigated common biomarkers of structural brain injury, in particular S100B, neuron-specific enolase, myelin basic protein, and glial fibrillary acid protein. DISCUSSION: The potential uses and limitations of these biomarkers in the context of TBI are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To describe mechanical ventilation strategies in acute lung injury and to estimate the number of eligible patients for clinical trials on mechanical ventilation management. In contrast to adult medicine, there are few clinical trials to guide mechanical ventilation management in children with acute lung injury. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study for six 24-hr periods from June to November 2007. SETTING: Fifty-nine pediatric intensive care units in 12 countries in North America and Europe. PATIENTS: We identified children meeting acute lung injury criteria and collected detailed information on illness severity, mechanical ventilatory support, and use of adjunctive therapies. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 3823 patients screened, 414 (10.8%) were diagnosed with acute lung injury by their treating physician, but only 165 (4.3%) patients met prestablished inclusion/exclusion criteria to this trial and, therefore, would have been eligible for a clinical trial. Of these, 124 (75.2%) received conventional mechanical ventilation, 27 (16.4%) received high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, and 14 (8.5%) received noninvasive mechanical ventilation. In the conventional mechanical ventilation group, 43.5% were ventilated in a pressure control mode with a mean tidal volume of 8.3 +/- 3.3 mL/kg; and there was no clear relationship between positive end-expiratory pressure and Fio2 delivery in the conventional mechanical ventilation group. Use of adjunctive treatments, including nitric oxide, prone positioning, surfactant, hemofiltration, recruitment maneuvers, steroids, bronchodilators, and fluid restriction, was highly variable. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals inconsistent mechanical ventilation practice and use of adjunctive therapies in children with acute lung injury. Pediatric clinical trials assessing mechanical ventilation management are needed to generate evidence to optimize outcomes. We estimate that a large number of centers ( approximately 60) are needed to conduct such trials; it is imperative, therefore, to bring about international collaboration.},

Diagnoses associated with subsequent rehospitalization were examined by age and sex.Of the patients with TBI, 35.5\% (n=10,390) were subsequently hospitalized during the 3-year follow-up period. Multivariable logistic regression (controlling for index admission hospital) identified men, older age, mechanism of injury being a fall, greater injury severity, rural residence, greater comorbidity, and psychiatric comorbidity to be significant predictors of rehospitalization in a 3-year period postinjury. The most common causes for rehospitalization differed by age and sex.Rehospitalization after TBI is common. Factors associated with rehospitalization can inform long-term postdischarge planning. Findings also support examining causes for rehospitalization by age and sex.},

  Abstract                 = {AIMS: To review the precipitating events, clinical features, treatment, and outcome of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). METHODS: Retrospective review of cases of MAS from a prospectively collected database of children with rheumatic diseases from 1980 to 2000. RESULTS: Nine patients (eight girls) were considered to have evidence of MAS. The primary diagnosis was systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis in seven, enthesitis related arthritis in one, and chronic infantile neurological cutaneous articular syndrome in one. Mean age of onset was 5.7 years, and duration prior to MAS, 4.2 years. No medication was identified as a trigger. Eight had infections prior to MAS; specific infectious agents were identified in four. High grade fever, new onset hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy were common clinical features. Platelet counts fell dramatically, from an average of 346 to 99 x 10(9)/l. Mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate (in three patients) fell from 115 to 28 mm/h. Eight had abnormal liver function during the disease course, and six had coagulopathy. Bone marrow examination supported the diagnosis with definite haemophagocytosis in four of seven. All received high dose steroids (eight intravenous, one oral), five cyclosporin, two cyclophosphamide, and one antithymocyte globulin. Two of three patients with significant renal impairment died. CONCLUSION: MAS is a rare and potentially fatal complication of childhood rheumatic disorders. Most of our patients were female, and most cases were preceded by infection. Bone marrow studies support the diagnosis. Deranged renal function may be a poor prognostic sign. Aggressive early therapy is essential.},

  Abstract                 = {Pediatric trauma is usually a nonoperative experience for the pediatric general surgeon. The pediatric trauma surgeon resuscitates the child and then evaluates and triages the identified injuries. A common diagnostic tool is the computed tomography (CT) scan. Most children who require evaluation for significant trauma will get a CT scan, but there are no national guidelines directing the assessment. Injuries to the head, cervical spine, chest, and abdomen can all be imaged with a CT scan; the question is whether the liberal approach to imaging children is appropriate. Over the past decade, concern has arisen about the radiation dose delivered by CT. This concern has generated a national campaign to "image gently." This article reviews the data involving the risk of medical radiation exposure and discusses strategies for managing the risk.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Skin breakdown increases the cost of care, may lead to increased morbidity, and has negative psychosocial implications because of secondary scarring or alopecia. The scope of this problem has not been widely studied in critically ill and injured children.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of skin breakdown in critically ill and injured children and to compare the characteristics of patients who experience skin breakdown with those of patients who do not.
METHODS: Admission and follow-up data for a 15-week period were collected retrospectively on children admitted to a large pediatric intensive care unit. The incidence of skin breakdown was calculated. The risk for skin breakdown associated with potential risk factors (relative risk) and 95% confidence intervals were determined.
RESULTS: The sample consisted of 401 distinct stays in the intensive care unit for 373 patients. During the 401 stays, skin breakdown occurred in 34 (8.5%), redness in 25 (6.2%), and breakdown and redness in 13 (3.2%); the overall incidence was 18%. Patients who had skin breakdown or redness were younger, had longer stays, and were more likely to have respiratory illnesses and require mechanical ventilatory support than those who did not. Patients who had skin breakdown or redness had a higher risk of mortality than those who did not.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for skin breakdown were similar to those previously reported. Compared with children of other ages, children 2 years or younger are at higher risk for skin breakdown.},

OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of pressure ulcers in critically ill children, to compare the characteristics of patients in whom pressure ulcers do and do not develop, and to identify prevention strategies associated with less frequent development of pressure ulcers.
METHODS: Characteristics of 5346 patients in pediatric intensive care units in whom pressure ulcers did and did not develop were compared. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine which prevention strategies were associated with less frequent development of pressure ulcers.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of pressure ulcers was 10.2%. Patients at greatest risk were those who were more than 2 years old; who were in the intensive care unit 4 days or longer; or who required mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Strategies associated with less frequent development of pressure ulcers included use of specialty beds, egg crates, foam overlays, gel pads, dry-weave diapers, urinary catheters, disposable under-pads, body lotion, nutrition consultations, change in body position every 2 to 4 hours, blanket rolls, foam wedges, pillows, and draw sheets.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of pressure ulcers among critically ill infants and children is greater than 10%. Nursing interventions play an important role in the prevention of pressure ulcers.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Large health care utilization databases are frequently used to analyze unintended effects of prescription drugs and biologics. Confounders that require detailed information on clinical parameters, lifestyle, or over-the-counter medications are often not measured in such datasets, causing residual confounding bias. OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a systematic approach to sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of residual confounding in pharmacoepidemiologic studies that use health care utilization databases. METHODS: Four basic approaches to sensitivity analysis were identified: (1) sensitivity analyses based on an array of informed assumptions; (2) analyses to identify the strength of residual confounding that would be necessary to explain an observed drug-outcome association; (3) external adjustment of a drug-outcome association given additional information on single binary confounders from survey data using algebraic solutions; (4) external adjustment considering the joint distribution of multiple confounders of any distribution from external sources of information using propensity score calibration. CONCLUSION: Sensitivity analyses and external adjustments can improve our understanding of the effects of drugs and biologics in epidemiologic database studies. With the availability of easy-to-apply techniques, sensitivity analyses should be used more frequently, substituting qualitative discussions of residual confounding.},

Their size allows the study of infrequent events, their representativeness of routine clinical care makes it possible to study real-world effectiveness and utilization patterns, and their availability at relatively low cost without long delays makes them accessible to many researchers. However, concerns about database studies include data validity, lack of detailed clinical information, and a limited ability to control confounding. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We consider the strengths, limitations, and appropriate applications of health care utilization databases in epidemiology and health services research, with particular reference to the study of medications. CONCLUSION: Progress has been made on many methodologic issues related to the use of health care utilization databases in recent years, but important areas persist and merit scrutiny.},

RESULTS: Of 2,516,833 encounters between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2000, 25,783 cases involved patients < or = 17 years of age with a recorded diagnosis of traumatic brain injury. On the basis of these data, there were an estimated 50,658 traumatic brain injury-associated hospitalizations among children < or = 17 years of age in the United States in 2000. The traumatic brain injury-associated hospitalization rate was 70 cases per 100,000 children < or = 17 years of age per year; 15- to 17-year-old patients had the highest hospitalization rate (125 cases per 100,000 children per year). Pediatric inpatients accrued more than $1 billion in total charges for traumatic brain injury-associated hospitalizations in this study. In the multivariate regression models, older age, Medicaid insurance status, and admission to any type of children's hospital were associated with a longer length of stay for pediatric traumatic brain injury-associated hospitalizations. Older age, longer length of stay, and in-hospital death predicted higher total charges for traumatic brain injury-associated hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: Pediatric traumatic brain injury is a substantial contributor to the health resource burden in the United States, accounting for more than $1 billion in total hospital charges annually.},

METHODS: Claims data analysis (Health Insurance Sample AOK Hesse/KV Hesse, 18.75% random sample of insurants from AOK Hesse, Germany) is used in the study. The study population is composed of 73,665 insurants >64 years of age continuously insured in the last quarter of 2009 and either continuously insured or deceased in 2010. Prevalence estimates are standardized to the population of Germany (31 December 2010). The variables age, sex, polypharmacy, hospital stay and nursing care are assessed for their independent association with general PIM prescription and among 11 therapeutic subgroups using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In 2010, 22.0% of the elderly received at least one PIM prescription (men: 18.3%, women: 24.8%). The highest PIM prevalence was observed for antidepressants (6.5%), antihypertensives (3.8%) and antiarrhythmic drugs (3.5%). Amitriptyline, tetrazepam, doxepin, acetyldigoxin, doxazosin and etoricoxib were the most frequently prescribed PIMs. Multivariate analyses indicate that women (OR 1.39; 95% CI: 1.34-1.44) and persons with extreme polypharmacy (>/=10 vs. <5 drugs: OR 5.16; 95% CI: 4.87-5.47) were at higher risk for receiving a PRISCUS-PIM. Risk analysis for therapeutic groups shows divergent associations. CONCLUSION: PRISCUS-PIMs are widely used. Educational programs should focus on drugs with high treatment prevalence and call professionals' attention to those elderly patients who are at special risk for inappropriate medication.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Critical congenital heart disease has been proposed as a target of newborn screening. This study aimed to define the incidence and timing of significant physiologic compromise attributable to critical congenital heart disease as well as the distribution of vulnerable lesions. These descriptive parameters must be defined to evaluate the impact and feasibility of any proposed screening strategy. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of neonates who had critical congenital heart disease and were admitted to a single institution was conducted. Critical congenital heart disease was defined as congenital heart disease that required invasive intervention or resulted in death in the first 30 days of life. Significant physiologic compromise was defined by severe metabolic acidosis, seizure, cardiac arrest, or laboratory evidence of renal or hepatic injury before invasive intervention. Significant physiologic compromise was classified as potentially preventable when it occurred as a result of undiagnosed congenital heart disease after 12 hours of life. RESULTS: Significant physiologic compromise occurred in 76 (15.5%) of 490 patients, and potentially preventable significant physiologic compromise occurred in 33 (6.7%) of 490 patients. Most (83%) significant physiologic compromise as a result of unrecognized congenital heart disease occurred after 12 hours of age. A total of 90.9% of cases of potentially preventable significant physiologic compromise had aortic arch obstruction. The incidence of potentially preventable significant physiologic compromise as a result of congenital heart disease in the general population is estimated to be 1 per 15,000 to 1 per 26,000 live births. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and timing of significant physiologic compromise as a result of critical congenital heart disease seems amenable to postnatal screening. Any viable screening strategy must be sensitive for lesions with aortic arch obstruction.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Long-term complications of critical illness include intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness and neuropsychiatric disease. Immobilisation secondary to sedation might potentiate these problems. We assessed the efficacy of combining daily interruption of sedation with physical and occupational therapy on functional outcomes in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in intensive care. METHODS: Sedated adults (>/=18 years of age) in the ICU who had been on mechanical ventilation for less than 72 h, were expected to continue for at least 24 h, and who met criteria for baseline functional independence were eligible for enrolment in this randomised controlled trial at two university hospitals. We randomly assigned 104 patients by computer-generated, permuted block randomisation to early exercise and mobilisation (physical and occupational therapy) during periods of daily interruption of sedation (intervention; n=49) or to daily interruption of sedation with therapy as ordered by the primary care team (control; n=55). The primary endpoint-the number of patients returning to independent functional status at hospital discharge-was defined as the ability to perform six activities of daily living and the ability to walk independently. Therapists who undertook patient assessments were blinded to treatment assignment. Secondary endpoints included duration of delirium and ventilator-free days during the first 28 days of hospital stay. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00322010. FINDINGS: All 104 patients were included in the analysis. Return to independent functional status at hospital discharge occurred in 29 (59%) patients in the intervention group compared with 19 (35%) patients in the control group (p=0.02; odds ratio 2.7 [95% CI 1.2-6.1]). Patients in the intervention group had shorter duration of delirium (median 2.0 days, IQR 0.0-6.0 vs 4.0 days, 2.0-8.0; p=0.02), and more ventilator-free days (23.5 days, 7.4-25.6 vs 21.1 days, 0.0-23.8; p=0.05) during the 28-day follow-up period than did controls. There was one serious adverse event in 498 therapy sessions (desaturation less than 80%). Discontinuation of therapy as a result of patient instability occurred in 19 (4%) of all sessions, most commonly for perceived patient-ventilator asynchrony. INTERPRETATION: A strategy for whole-body rehabilitation-consisting of interruption of sedation and physical and occupational therapy in the earliest days of critical illness-was safe and well tolerated, and resulted in better functional outcomes at hospital discharge, a shorter duration of delirium, and more ventilator-free days compared with standard care.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Coronary artery dilation (CAD) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction are recognized complications of Kawasaki Disease (KD). Diastolic function assessed by echocardiography in the KD patient population and its interrelationship to the KD course, systolic dysfunction, and CAD is less well characterized. The purpose of this study was to determine whether diastolic function is impaired in KD patients and whether there are any clinical correlates. DESIGN/METHODS: All KD patients with an echocardiogram recording of tissue Doppler velocities were included. Patients were analyzed based on CAD (Group I: patients who had CAD during their disease course; Group II: patients who never had CAD). In addition, we compared measures of diastolic function in patients with echocardiograms 0-30days (n=35) and >30days (n=72) post-IVIG treatment. RESULTS: 116 patients (80 males) were included (mean age, 7.7+/-6.7years; mean time since KD onset, 4.0+/-5.6years). Group I (41 patients, 36%), compared to Group II, had decreased E'(lateral) and longer mitral early deceleration time. E'(lateral) and E'(septal) were significantly decreased in patients 0-30days vs. >30days post-IVIG, whereas mitral early deceleration time was not significantly different. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that there is impaired relaxation in KD patients in the early phase of the disease and in KD patients with CAD during the disease course.},

  Abstract                 = {An evidence gap exists in comparing the effectiveness of angiotensin receptor II blockers (ARBs) for hypertension with that of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). We identified elderly hypertensive patients in whom ACEI/ARB therapy had been initiated after hospitalization for coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), or stroke and who were eligible for Medicare and state pharmacy assistance programs. Of 18,801 initiators of ACEIs and 2,641 initiators of ARBs, 2,535 died during the follow-up. We observed substantial differences in characteristics between ARB and ACEI initiators, suggesting that ARB users were more health seeking. The incidence of death and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in ACEI initiators was 77 and 22 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. The relative risk for SCD comparing ARB initiators to ACEI initiators was 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.96); when the analysis was restricted to patients with low ejection fraction (EF), the relative risk was 1.1. The reduced risk of SCD can be explained, at least partly, by (i) residual confounding because ARB users were healthier on unobserved domains and (ii) lack of data on EF.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Early recognition and treatment in severe sepsis improve outcomes. However, out-of-hospital patient characteristics and emergency medical services (EMS) care in severe sepsis is understudied. Our goals were to describe out-of-hospital characteristics and EMS care in patients with severe sepsis and to evaluate associations between out-of-hospital characteristics and severity of organ dysfunction in the emergency department (ED). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a secondary data analysis of existing data from patients with severe sepsis transported by EMS to an academic medical center. We constructed multivariable linear regression models to determine if out-of-hospital factors are associated with serum lactate and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) in the ED. RESULTS: Two hundred sixteen patients with severe sepsis arrived by EMS. Median serum lactate in the ED was 3.0 mmol/L (interquartile range, 2.0-5.0) and median SOFA score was 4 (interquartile range, 2-6). Sixty-three percent (135) of patients were transported by advanced life support providers and 30% (62) received intravenous fluid. Lower out-of-hospital Glasgow Coma Scale score was independently associated with elevated serum lactate (P < .01). Out-of-hospital hypotension, greater respiratory rate, and lower Glasgow Coma Scale score were associated with greater SOFA (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Out-of-hospital fluid resuscitation occurred in less than one third of patients with severe sepsis, and routinely measured out-of-hospital variables were associated with greater serum lactate and SOFA in the ED.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Early identification and treatment of patients with severe sepsis improves outcome, yet the role of out-of-hospital intravenous (IV) fluid is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the delivery of out-of-hospital fluid in patients with severe sepsis is associated with reduced time to achievement of goal-oriented resuscitation in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: We performed a secondary data analysis of a retrospective cohort study in a metropolitan, tertiary care, university-based medical center supported by a two-tiered system of out-of-hospital emergency medical services (EMS) providers. We studied the association between delivery of out-of-hospital fluid by advanced life support (ALS) providers and the achievement of resuscitation endpoints (central venous pressure [CVP] > or =8 mmHg, mean arterial pressure [MAP] > or =65 mmHg, and central venous oxygen saturation [ScvO(2)] > or =70%) within six hours after triage during early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) in the ED. RESULTS: Twenty five (48%) of 52 patients transported by ALS with severe sepsis received out-of-hospital fluid. Data for age, gender, source of sepsis, and presence of comorbidities were similar between patients who did and did not receive out-of-hospital fluid. Patients receiving out-of-hospital fluid had lower out-of-hospital mean (+/- standard deviation) systolic blood pressure (95 +/- 40 mmHg vs. 117 +/- 29 mmHg; p = 0.03) and higher median (interquartile range) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores in the ED (7 [5-8] vs. 4 [4-6]; p = 0.01) than patients not receiving out-of-hospital fluid. Despite greater severity of illness, patients receiving out-of-hospital fluid approached but did not attain a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of achieving MAP > or =65 mmHg within six hours after ED triage (70% vs. 44%, p = 0.09). On average, patients receiving out-of-hospital fluid received twice the fluid volume within one hour after ED triage (1.1 L [1.0-2.0 L] vs. 0.6 L [0.3-1.0 L]; p = 0.01). No difference in achievement of goal CVP (72% vs. 60%; p = 0.6) or goal ScvO(2) (54% vs. 36%; p = 0.25) was observed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Less than half of patients with severe sepsis transported by ALS received out-of-hospital fluid. Patients receiving out-of-hospital IV access and fluids approached but did not attain a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of achieving goal MAP during EGDT. These preliminary findings require additional investigation to evaluate the optimal role of out-of-hospital resuscitation in treating patients with severe sepsis.},

  Abstract                 = {Airway pressure release ventilation and biphasic positive airway pressure ventilation are being used increasingly as alternative strategies to conventional assist control ventilation for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury. By permitting spontaneous breathing throughout the ventilatory cycle, these modes offer several advantages over conventional strategies to improve the pathophysiology in these patients, including gas exchange, cardiovascular function, and reducing or eliminating the need for heavy sedation and paralysis. Whether these surrogate outcomes will translate into better patient outcomes remains to be determined. The purpose of this review is to summarize the rationale behind the use of these ventilatory strategies in ARDS, the clinical experience with the use of these modes, and their future applications in trauma patients.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a major public health problem. Social factors may impact health behaviors, economic resources, and immune response, leading to hospitalization for infection. This study examines the association between marital status and sepsis incidence and outcomes in a population-based cohort. METHODS: We analyzed 1,113,581 hospitalizations in New Jersey in 2006. We estimated risk-adjusted incidence rate ratios for sepsis among divorced, widowed, legally separated (LS), single, and married subjects using population data from the American Community Survey. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate marital status-specific hospital mortality. RESULTS: We identified 37,524 hospitalizations for sepsis, of which 40% were among married (14,924), 7% were among divorced (2,548), 26% were among widowed (9,934), 2% (763) were among LS, and 26% (9355) among single subjects. The incidence of hospitalization for sepsis was 5.8 per 1,000 population. The age, gender, and race-adjusted incidence rate ratio for hospitalization with sepsis was greatest for single (IRR=3.47, 95%CI:3.1,3.9), widowed (IRR=1.38, 95%CI:1.2,1.6), and LS (IRR=1.46, 95%CI:1.2,1.8) subjects compared to married (ref). We observed that single men and women and divorced men had greater odds of in-hospital mortality compared to married men; widowed and LS men and all ever-married women had no excess mortality during hospitalization for sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization for sepsis is more common among single, widowed, and LS individuals, independent of other demographic factors. Among patients hospitalized for sepsis, single and divorced males and single women experience greater hospital mortality, highlighting the need to characterize the potentially modifiable mechanisms linking marital status to its greater burden of critical illness.},

DATA SOURCE: Hospital discharge data in the State Inpatient Database for Maryland and Washington States in 2006. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of 90 short-term, acute care hospitals with critical care capabilities. DATA COLLECTION/METHODS: We quantified the proportion of variation in intensive care use attributable to hospitals using intraclass correlation coefficients derived from mixed-effects logistic regression models after successive adjustment for known patient and hospital factors. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The proportion of hospitalized patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) across hospitals ranged from 3 to 55 percent (median 12 percent; IQR: 9, 17 percent). After adjustment for patient factors, 19.7 percent (95 percent CI: 15.1, 24.4) of total variation in ICU use across hospitals was attributable to hospitals. When observed hospital characteristics were added, the proportion of total variation in intensive care use attributable to unmeasured hospital factors decreased by 26-14.6 percent (95 percent CI: 11, 18.3 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Wide variability exists in the use of intensive care across hospitals, not attributable to known patient or hospital factors, and may be a target to improve efficiency and quality of critical care.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: To determine the global metabolomic profile as measured in circulating plasma from surviving and non-surviving patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. METHODS: Random, outcome-stratified case-control sample from a prospective study of 1,895 patients hospitalized with CAP and sepsis. Cases (n = 15) were adults who died before 90 days, and controls (n = 15) were adults who survived, matched on demographics, infection type, and procalcitonin. We determined the global metabolomic profile in the first emergency department blood sample using non-targeted mass-spectrometry. We derived metabolite-based prognostic models for 90-day mortality. We determined if metabolites stimulated cytokine production by differentiated Thp1 monocytes in vitro, and validated metabolite profiles in mouse liver and kidney homogenates at 8 h in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. RESULTS: We identified 423 small molecules, of which the relative levels of 70 (17 %) were different between survivors and non-survivors (p </= 0.05). Broad differences were present in pathways of oxidative stress, bile acid metabolism, and stress response. Metabolite-based prognostic models for 90-day survival performed modestly (AUC = 0.67, 95 % CI 0.48, 0.81). Five nucleic acid metabolites were greater in non-survivors (p </= 0.05). Of these, pseudouridine increased monocyte expression of TNFalpha and IL1beta versus control (p < 0.05). Pseudouridine was also increased in liver and kidney homogenates from CLP mice versus sham (p < 0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Although replication is required, we show the global metabolomic profile in plasma broadly differs between survivors and non-survivors of CAP and sepsis. Metabolite-based prognostic models had modest performance, though metabolites of oxidative stress may act as putative damage-associated molecular patterns.},

SETTING: Administrative database containing inpatient resource utilization data from January 1 to December 31, 2004, from 31 tertiary care pediatric hospitals in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients 18 years or younger. MAIN EXPOSURES: Institution and patient characteristics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Off-label drug use was defined as use of a specific drug in a patient younger than the Food and Drug Administration-approved age range for any indication of that drug. RESULTS: At least 1 drug was used off-label in 297 592 (78.7%) of 355 409 patients discharged during the study. Off-label use accounted for $270 275 849 (40.5%) of the total dollars spent on these medications. Medications classified as central or autonomic nervous system agents or as fluids or nutrients, or gastrointestinal tract agents were most commonly used off-label, whereas antineoplastic agents were rarely used off-label. Factors associated with off-label use in multivariate analysis were as follows: undergoing a surgical procedure, age older than 28 days, greater severity of illness, and all-cause in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients hospitalized at tertiary care pediatric institutions receive at least 1 medication outside the terms of the Food and Drug Administration product license. Substantial variation in the frequency of off-label use was observed across diagnostic categories and drug classes. Despite the frequent off-label use of drugs, using an administrative database, we cannot determine which of these treatments are unsafe or ineffective and which treatments result in substantial benefit to the patient.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the comparative effectiveness of common pleural drainage procedures for treatment of pneumonia complicated by parapneumonic effusion (ie, complicated pneumonia). DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Forty children's hospitals contributing data to the Pediatric Health Information System. PARTICIPANTS: Children with complicated pneumonia requiring pleural drainage. MAIN EXPOSURES: Initial drainage procedures were categorized as chest tube without fibrinolysis, chest tube with fibrinolysis, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), and thoracotomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Length of stay (LOS), additional drainage procedures, readmission within 14 days of discharge, and hospital costs. RESULTS: Initial procedures among 3500 patients included chest tube without fibrinolysis (n = 1762), chest tube with fibrinolysis (n = 623), VATS (n = 408), and thoracotomy (n = 797). Median age was 4.1 years. Overall, 716 (20.5%) patients received an additional drainage procedure (range, 6.8-44.8% across individual hospitals). The median LOS was 10 days (range, 7-14 days across individual hospitals). The median readmission rate was 3.8% (range, 0.8%-33.3%). In multivariable analysis, differences in LOS by initial procedure type were not significant. Patients undergoing initial chest tube placement with or without fibrinolysis were more likely to require additional drainage procedures. However, initial chest tube without fibrinolysis was the least costly strategy. CONCLUSION: There is variability in the treatment and outcomes of children with complicated pneumonia. Outcomes were similar in patients undergoing initial chest tube placement with or without fibrinolysis. Those undergoing VATS received fewer additional drainage procedures but had no differences in LOS compared with other strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare and severe manifestation of group A streptococcal infection. The role of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for streptococcal TSS in children is controversial. This study aims to describe the epidemiology of streptococcal TSS in children and to determine whether adjunctive therapy with IVIG is associated with improved outcomes. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study of children with streptococcal TSS from 1 January 2003 through 31 December 2007 was conducted. Propensity scores were used to determine each child's likelihood of receiving IVIG. Differences in the primary outcomes of death, hospital length of stay, and total hospital costs were compared after matching IVIG recipients and nonrecipients on propensity score. RESULTS: The median patient age was 8.2 years. IVIG was administered to 84 (44%) of 192 patients. The overall mortality rate was 4.2% (95% confidence interval, 1.8%-8.0%). Differences in mortality between IVIG recipients (n = 3; 4.5%) and nonrecipients (n = 3; 4.5%) were not statistically significant (p > .99). Although patients receiving IVIG had higher total hospital and drug costs than nonrecipients, differences in hospital costs were not significant once drug costs were removed (median difference between matched patients, $6139; interquartile range, -$8316 to $25,993; P = .06). No differences were found in length of hospital stay between matched IVIG recipients and nonrecipients. CONCLUSION: This multicenter study is, to our knowledge, the largest to describe the epidemiology and outcomes of children with streptococcal TSS and the first to explore the association between IVIG use and clinical outcomes. IVIG use was associated with increased costs of caring for children with streptococcal TSS but was not associated with improved outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {We have examined the role of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) in gentamicin nephrotoxicity and in glycerol-induced acute renal failure, a model for myoglobinuric acute renal failure. Several agents which affect mitochondrial respiration have been shown to enhance the generation of hydrogen peroxide. Based on gentamicin's ability to alter mitochondrial respiration both in vitro and in vivo we postulated that gentamicin may enhance the generation of ROM by renal cortical mitochondria. Gentamicin, in a dose-dependent fashion, enhanced hydrogen peroxide production by rat renal cortical mitochondria as measured by the decrease in scopoletin fluorescence. At the highest concentration of gentamicin tested (4.0 mM), the rate of hydrogen peroxide generation was markedly increased from 0.17 +/- 0.02 to 6.21 +/- 0.67 nmol/mg/min. We next demonstrated that hydroxyl radical scavengers and an iron chelator provide a marked functional and histological protection in gentamicin-induced acute renal failure in rats. Hydroxyl radical scavengers and the iron chelator deferoxamine also protected renal function in glycerol-injected rats, a model for acute renal failure due to muscle injury. Although these data suggest that ROM may be important mediators of toxic renal injury, in vivo generation of ROM by kidney in normal and pathological states has not been previously examined. Aminotriazole (AT) irreversibly inactivates catalase only in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and previous studies have shown that AT-mediated inhibition of catalase in a sensitive measure of in vivo changes in the hydrogen peroxide generation. Using this method, we have demonstrated the in vivo generation of hydrogen peroxide under normal conditions and enhanced generation of hydrogen peroxide in rats treated with gentamicin or glycerol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is increasing. Multicenter studies of CDI have been limited by the lack of valid case-finding tools. To facilitate pediatric studies of CDI, we constructed a case-finding tool using administrative data. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using the Pediatric Health Information System database and microbiologic data from 4 member hospitals. Using patients with laboratory-confirmed CDI as the standard, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV), and negative (NPV) predictive value of an ICD-9-CM code for identifying children with laboratory-confirmed CDI. RESULTS: We identified 109 patients with laboratory-confirmed CDI and 119 patients with CDI ICD-9-CM code. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 80.73%, 99.89%, 73.95%, and 99.92%, respectively, for this comparison. The addition of a billing charge for both C. difficile laboratory test and treatment medication to the ICD-9-CM code increased the specificity and PPV, but resulted in a slight decrease in the sensitivity and NPV. The use of administrative data for identifying pediatric cases of CDI was also compared with that of chart review, and was found to be a stronger surrogate for identifying cases of CDI when compared with microbiology data alone. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the use of administrative data for CDI is a reliable and accurate method for identifying pediatric patients with CDI. The use of administrative data could facilitate the completion of larger studies due to its greater accessibility and reduced costs.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To examine national, regional, and state abusive head trauma (AHT) trends using child hospital discharge data by applying a new coding algorithm developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). METHODS: Data from 4 waves of the Kids' Inpatient Database and annual discharge data from North Carolina were used to determine trends in AHT incidence among children <1 year of age between 2000 and 2009. National, regional, and state incidence rates were calculated. Poisson regression analyses were used to examine national, regional, and state AHT trends. RESULTS: The CDC narrow and broad algorithms identified 5437 and 6317 cases, respectively, in the 4 years of KID weighted data. This yielded average annual incidences of 33.4 and 38.8 cases per 100,000 children <1 year of age. There was no statistically significant change in national rates. There were variations by region of the country, with significantly different trends in the Midwest and West. State data for North Carolina showed wide annual variation in rates, with no significant trend. CONCLUSIONS: The new coding algorithm resulted in the highest AHT rates reported to date. At the same time, we found large but statistically insignificant annual variations in AHT rates in 1 large state. This suggests that caution should be used in interpreting AHT trends and attributing changes in rates as being caused by changes in policies, programs, or the economy.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a logistic regression model that predicts the risk of death for children less than 16 years of age in intensive care, using information collected at the time of admission to the unit. DESIGN: Three prospective cohort studies, from 1988 to 1995, were used to determine the variables for the final model. A fourth cohort study, from 1994 to 1996, collected information from consecutive admissions to all seven dedicated paediatric intensive care units in Australia and one in Britain. RESULTS: 2904 patients were included in the first three parts of the study, which identified ten variables for further evaluation. 5695 children were in the fourth part of the study (including 1412 from the third part); a model that used eight variables was developed on data from four of the units and tested on data from the other four units. The model fitted the test data well (deciles of risk goodness-of-fit test p = 0.40) and discriminated well between death and survival (area under the receiver operating characteristic plot 0.90). The final PIM model used the data from all 5695 children and also fitted well (p = 0.37) and discriminated well (area 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Scores that use the worst value of their predictor variables in the first 12-24 h should not be used to compare different units: patients mismanaged in a bad unit will have higher scores than similar patients managed in a good unit, and the bad unit's high mortality rate will be incorrectly attributed to its having sicker patients. PIM is a simple model that is based on only eight explanatory variables collected at the time of admission to intensive care. It is accurate enough to be used to describe the risk of mortality in groups of children.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of nonoperative management of solid abdominal organ injury from blunt trauma in neurologically impaired patients has been questioned. A statewide trauma registry was reviewed from January 1993 through December 1995 for all adult (age >12 years) patients with blunt trauma and an abdominal solid organ injury (kidney, liver, or spleen) of Abbreviated Injury Scale score > or =2. Patients with initial hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) were excluded. Patients were stratified by Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) into normal (GCS 15), mild to moderate (GCS 8-14), and severe (GCS < or =7) impairment groups. Management was either operative or nonoperative; failure of nonoperative management was defined as requiring laparotomy for intraabdominal injury more than 24 hours after admission. In the 3-year period 2327 patients sustained solid viscus injuries; 1561 of these patients were managed nonoperatively (66 per cent). The nonoperative approach was initiated less frequently in those patients with greater impairment in mental status: GCS 15, 71 per cent; GCS 8 to 14, 62 per cent; and GCS < or =7, 50 per cent. Mortality, hospital length of stay, and intensive care unit days were greater in operatively managed GCS 15 and 8 to 14 groups but were not different on the basis of management in the GCS < or =7 group. Failure of nonoperative management occurred in 94 patients (6%). There was no difference in the nonoperative failure rate between patients with normal mental status and those with mild to moderate or severe head injuries. Nonoperative management of neurologically impaired hemodynamically stable patients with blunt injuries of liver, spleen, or kidney is commonly practiced and is successful in more than 90 per cent of cases. No differences were noted in the rates of delayed laparotomy or survival between normal, mild to moderately head-injured, and severely head-injured patients.},

Even so, there have not been many of these collaborations. We review one, the Michigan regional collaborative improvement program, which was paid for by a large private insurer, has yielded improvements for a range of clinical conditions, and has reduced costs in several important areas. In general and vascular surgery alone, complications from surgery dropped almost 2.6 percent among participating Michigan hospitals-a change that translates into 2,500 fewer Michigan patients with surgical complications each year. Estimated annual savings from this one collaborative are approximately $20 million, far exceeding the cost of administering the program. Regional collaborative improvement programs should become increasingly attractive to hospitals and physicians, as well as to national policy makers, as they seek to improve health care quality and reduce costs.},

  Abstract                 = {Hospital transfer is associated with delays in performance of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Given the limited number of interventional centers in the United States, the transfer of patients is widely practiced. We compared the outcome of patients who were transferred for primary PCI and determined whether prolonged door-to-balloon times were associated with increased mortality. Patients who presented within 12 hours with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and underwent transfer for primary PCI were identified from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction database (NRMI databases 2, 3, and 4, n = 7,133). The short-term outcome of those who received early (< or =2 hours) was compared with that of those who received delayed primary PCI (>2 hours) using multivariate logistic regression analyses and propensity score methods. The door-to-balloon time for the early PCI group compared with the delayed PCI group was 99 +/- 16 versus 264 +/- 178 minutes, respectively (p <0.0001). The early PCI group had less recurrent ischemia and angina (5.8% vs 10.1%, p <0.001), less cardiogenic shock (5.1% vs 8.9%, p <0.001), and shorter length of hospital stay (4.4 +/- 3.5 vs 5.4 +/- 4.7 days, p <0.001). In-hospital mortality was lower for the early PCI group than for the delayed PCI group (2.7% vs 6.2%, p < 0.001; entire cohort 5.7%). Comparison of patients matched on propensity score (n = 993) showed that mortality was lower in the early than in the delayed PCI group (2.6% vs 4.6%, p = 0.014, c-statistic 0.67). In conclusion, <4% of patients who received PCI were treated within the recommended guideline of < 120 minutes by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association. Door-to-balloon times <2 hours in patients who undergo transfer for PCI is associated with a significant decrease in short-term mortality, which suggests that efforts must be made to decrease transfer delays.},

  Abstract                 = {PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To examine the hospitalization costs and discharge outcomes of US children with TBI and to evaluate a severity measure, the predictive mortality likelihood level. RESEARCH DESIGN: Data from the 2006 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) were used to report the national estimates and characteristics of TBI-associated hospitalizations among US children < or =20 years of age. The percentage of children with TBI caused by motor vehicle crashes (MVC) and falls was calculated according to the predictive mortality likelihood levels (PMLL), death in hospital and discharge into long-term rehabilitation facilities. Associations with the PMLL, discharge outcomes and average hospital charges were examined. RESULTS: In 2006, there were an estimated 58 900 TBI-associated hospitalizations among US children, accounting for $2.56 billion in hospital charges. MVCs caused 38.9% and falls caused 21.2% of TBI hospitalizations. The PMLL was strongly associated with TBI type, length of hospital stay, hospital charges and discharge disposition. About 4% of children with fall or MVC related TBIs died in hospital and 9% were discharged into long-term facilities. CONCLUSION: The PMLL may provide a useful tool to assess characteristics and treatment outcomes of hospitalized TBI children, but more research is still needed.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To describe intubation practices and duration of mechanical ventilation in children with status asthmaticus admitted from emergency departments (ERs) to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using the Virtual PICU Performance System database (VPS, LLC) of children with status asthmaticus admitted to a participating PICU between December 2003 and September 2006. The primary outcome measure was intubation prior to intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Secondary outcomes included length of intubation and medical length of stay. SETTING: Thirty-five PICUs in the United States. Patients: Children who were intubated and mechanically ventilated during their ICU stay for asthma and were admitted from an ER. RESULTS: A total of 4051 patients with status asthmaticus were identified. Intubation data were available from 35 of the 53 centers. Of all, 187 children were intubated for asthma, of which 157 were admitted from an ER and had complete data. Of all, 85 patients were from community hospital ERs and 72 were from the institution's own ER. In all, 115 (73%) patients were intubated prior to ICU admission and 42 (27%) patients were intubated after PICU admission. Of patients who received mechanical ventilation for status asthmaticus and were intubated prior to PICU admission, a greater proportion were intubated at community hospital ERs than in the institutions' own ERs. Eighty-five percent of the patients from community hospital ERs were intubated prior to PICU admission as opposed to 60% from institution's own ERs (P = .0004). However, median duration of intubation and PICU stay from community hospital ERs was significantly shorter than from the hospitals' own ERs (25 vs 42 hours P = .011; 57 vs 98 hours P = .0013, respectively). Logistic regression analysis revealed that after controlling for the effects of age, race, gender, and a revised version of the Paediatric Index of Mortality score of patients who were admitted for status asthmaticus and required mechanical ventilations, patients treated in community hospital ERs represented a greater proportion of preadmission intubation. The odds ratio for preadmission intubation was 5.1 if the patients arrived from community hospital ERs (95% confidence interval 1.91-13.6). CONCLUSION: Patients with status asthmaticus are more likely to be intubated when they are admitted from community hospital emergency rooms, although the duration of intubation and PICU stay is shorter.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the mechanical behaviour of chondrocytes as a result of cartilage tissue mechanics has significant implications for both evaluation of mechanobiological function and to elaborate on damage mechanisms. A common procedure for prediction of chondrocyte mechanics (and of cell mechanics in general) relies on a computational post-processing approach where tissue-level deformations drive cell-level models. Potential loss of information in this numerical coupling approach may cause erroneous cellular-scale results, particularly during multiphysics analysis of cartilage. The goal of this study was to evaluate the capacity of first- and second-order data passing to predict chondrocyte mechanics by analysing cartilage deformations obtained for varying complexity of loading scenarios. A tissue-scale model with a sub-region incorporating representation of chondron size and distribution served as control. The post-processing approach first required solution of a homogeneous tissue-level model, results of which were used to drive a separate cell-level model (same characteristics as the sub-region of control model). The first-order data passing appeared to be adequate for simplified loading of the cartilage and for a subset of cell deformation metrics, for example, change in aspect ratio. The second-order data passing scheme was more accurate, particularly when asymmetric permeability of the tissue boundaries was considered. Yet, the method exhibited limitations for predictions of instantaneous metrics related to the fluid phase, for example, mass exchange rate. Nonetheless, employing higher order data exchange schemes may be necessary to understand the biphasic mechanics of cells under lifelike tissue loading states for the whole time history of the simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Resuscitation in severe head injury may be detrimental when given with hypotonic fluids. We evaluated the effects of lactated Ringer's solution (sodium 131 mmol/L, 277 mOsm/L) compared with hypertonic saline (sodium 268 mmol/L, 598 mOsm/L) in severely head-injured children over the first 3 days after injury. DESIGN: An open, randomized, and prospective study. SETTING: A 16-bed pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) (level III) at a university children's hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 35 consecutive children with head injury. INTERVENTIONS: Thirty-two children with Glasgow Coma Scores of <8 were randomly assigned to receive either lactated Ringer's solution (group 1) or hypertonic saline (group 2). Routine care was standardized, and included the following: head positioning at 30 degrees; normothermia (96.8 degrees to 98.6 degrees F [36 degrees to 37 degrees C]); analgesia and sedation with morphine (10 to 30 microg/kg/hr), midazolam (0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg/hr), and phenobarbital; volume-controlled ventilation (PaCO2 of 26.3 to 30 torr [3.5 to 4 kPa]); and optimal oxygenation (PaO2 of 90 to 105 torr [12 to 14 kPa], oxygen saturation of >92%, and hematocrit of >0.30). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure and intracranial pressure (ICP) were monitored continuously and documented hourly and at every intervention. The means of every 4-hr period were calculated and serum sodium concentrations were measured at the same time. An ICP of 15 mm Hg was treated with a predefined sequence of interventions, and complications were documented. There was no difference with respect to age, male/female ratio, or initial Glasgow Coma Score. In both groups, there was an inverse correlation between serum sodium concentration and ICP (group 1: r = -.13, r2 = .02, p < .03; group 2: r = -.29, r2 = .08, p < .001) that disappeared in group 1 and increased in group 2 (group 1: r = -.08, r2 = .01, NS; group 2: r = -.35, r2 =.12, p < .001). Correlation between serum sodium concentration and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) became significant in group 2 after 8 hrs of treatment (r = .2, r2 = .04, p = .002). Over time, ICP and CPP did not significantly differ between the groups. However, to keep ICP at <15 mm Hg, group 2 patients required significantly fewer interventions (p < .02). Group 1 patients received less sodium (8.0 +/- 4.5 vs. 11.5 +/- 5.0 mmol/kg/day, p = .05) and more fluid on day 1 (2850 +/- 1480 vs. 2180 +/- 770 mL/m2, p = .05). They also had a higher frequency of acute respiratory distress syndrome (four vs. 0 patients, p = .1) and more than two complications (six vs. 1 patient, p = .09). Group 2 patients had significantly shorter ICU stay times (11.6 +/- 6.1 vs. 8.0 +/- 2.4 days; p = .04) and shorter mechanical ventilation times (9.5 +/- 6.0 vs. 6.9 +/- 2.2 days; p = .1). The survival rate and duration of hospital stay were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of severe head injury with hypertonic saline is superior to that treatment with lactated Ringer's solution. An increase in serum sodium concentrations significantly correlates with lower ICP and higher CPP. Children treated with hypertonic saline require fewer interventions, have fewer complications, and stay a shorter time in the ICU.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Hospitalized children are perceived to be increasingly medically complex, but no such trend has been documented. The objective of this study was to determine whether the proportion of pediatric inpatient use that is attributable to patients with a diagnosis of one or more complex chronic condition (CCC) has increased over time and to assess the degree to which CCC hospitalizations are associated with attributes that are consistent with heightened medical complexity. METHODS: A retrospective observational study that used the 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006 Kids Inpatient Databases examined US hospitalizations for children. Attributes of medical complexity included hospital admissions, length of stay, total charges, technology-assistance procedures, and mortality risk. RESULTS: The proportion of inpatient pediatric admissions, days, and charges increased from 1997 to 2006 for any CCC and for every CCC group except hematology. CCCs accounted for 8.9% of US pediatric admissions in 1997 and 10.1% of admissions in 2006. These admissions used 22.7% to 26.1% of pediatric hospital days, used 37.1% to 40.6% of pediatric hospital charges, accounted for 41.9% to 43.2% of deaths, and (for 2006) used 73% to 92% of different forms of technology-assistance procedures. As the number of CCCs for a given admission increased, all markers of use increased. CONCLUSIONS: CCC-associated hospitalizations compose an increasing proportion of inpatient care and resource use. Future research should seek to improve methods to identify the population of medically complex children, monitor their increasing inpatient use, and assess whether current systems of care are meeting their needs.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Hydrocephalus is a prototypical chronic condition that follows children into adulthood. The objectives of this study were to (1) review how the health care needs of young adults with hydrocephalus are not being met, (2) estimate the numbers of adults with childhood-onset hydrocephalus, (3) describe a novel program to provide care for young adults with hydrocephalus and other chronic pediatric conditions, and (4) propose national strategies to promote successful hydrocephalus transition care. RESULTS: Adults with hydrocephalus need continuous access to expert surgical and medical providers. Existing care models fail to meet this need. The number of young adults who have hydrocephalus, are aged 18 to 35 and need treatment in the United States is predicted to exceed 40000 annually within the next 2 decades. We are developing integrated teams of pediatric and adult medical and surgical specialists to provide continuous, coordinated, comprehensive care for individuals with hydrocephalus in a pediatric setting. This setting will train our future physician workforce on optimal transition care. Coordinated national efforts are also needed. CONCLUSIONS: Providers need to implement appropriate management and transition care for individuals with hydrocephalus. We must work at local and national levels to transform the care model, improve the quality of health care delivery, and improve outcomes for young adults with hydrocephalus.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECT: The aims of this study were to measure inpatient health care for pediatric hydrocephalus in the US; describe patient, hospital, and hospitalization characteristics for pediatric hydrocephalus inpatient care; and determine characteristics associated with death. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using the 1997, 2000, and 2003 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Databases (KID), nationally representative weighted data sets of hospital discharges for pediatric patients. A hydrocephalus-related hospitalization was classified as either cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt-related (including initial placements, infections, malfunctions, or other) or non-CSF shunt-related. Patients>18 years of age were excluded. The KID provided weighted estimates of 6.657, 6.597, and 6.732 million total discharges in the 3 study years. RESULTS: Each year there were 38,200-39,900 admissions, 391,000-433,000 hospital days, and total hospital charges of $1.4-2.0 billion for pediatric hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus accounted for 0.6% of all pediatric hospital admissions in the US in 2003, but for 1.8% of all pediatric hospital days and 3.1% of all pediatric hospital charges. Over the study years, children admitted with hydrocephalus were older, had an increase in comorbidities, and were admitted more frequently to teaching hospitals. Compared with children who survived, those who died were more likely to be <3 months of age and have a birth-related admission, have no insurance, have comorbidities, be transferred, and have a non-CSF shunt-related admission. CONCLUSIONS: Children with hydrocephalus have a chronic illness and use a disproportionate share of hospital days and healthcare dollars in the US. Since 1997 they have increased in age and in number of comorbid conditions. For important changes in morbidity and mortality rates to be made, focused research efforts and funding are necessary.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The management of blunt solid organ injury (SOI) in children may differ depending on the treating facility. These differences, however, may not reflect the individual surgeon's treatment philosophy. To investigate differences in management, adult and pediatric surgeons were presented the same hypothetical pediatric trauma "patient" and asked a series of treatment questions. METHODS: By using an internet-based survey, members of American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, American Academy of Pediatrics, and Eastern Association of the Surgery of Trauma were invited to participate anonymously. Surgeons who "never or rarely saw children" and those who "would transfer the patient to another facility" were excluded. Demographic, educational, and practice data were collected. Scenarios of increasing complexity were presented with CT images (isolated SOI, multiple SOI, and SOI with intracranial hemorrhage [ICH]). For each scenario, respondents were asked if they would initially manage the patient nonoperatively, pursue angiography, or operate. Scenarios were repeated with the addition of a CT "blush." For patients managed nonoperatively, respondents were asked their transfusion threshold needed to operate. Responses were compared using exact chi tests and risk ratios. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-one surgeons (114 pediatric, 167 adult) were included. For all scenarios, adult surgeons were more likely to operate or pursue embolization than their pediatric colleagues (RR: 8.6 SOI, 14.8 multiple SOI, 17.9 SOI with ICH). Adult surgeons were also more likely to consider any transfusion a failure (13.3% vs. 1.2%, p < 0.01) and had a much lower transfusion threshold. CONCLUSION: When presented with the identical clinical scenario, adult trauma surgeons are less likely than pediatric surgeons to pursue nonoperative management of pediatric solid organ injuries and are more conservative in their willingness to transfuse.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to expand the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) car safety seat testing recommendation to include high-risk infants after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Car safety seat testing (< or =4 days before discharge), performed according to AAP guidelines, was retrospectively reviewed for 66 postoperative infants. Failure was defined as apnea, bradycardia, or oxygen desaturation. RESULTS: The average birth weight of the study infants was 3.1 +/- 0.5 kg. Two patients were born at less than 37 weeks gestation. Surgical procedures included modified Blalock-Taussig shunt technique (n = 15), arterial switch operation (n = 12), Norwood Sano modification (n = 11), coarctation repair (n = 8), repair of tetralogy of Fallot (n = 6), repair of truncus arteriosus (n = 4), repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous return (n = 3), pacemaker placement (n = 2), repair of interrupted aortic arch and ventriculoseptal defect (VSD) (n = 1), repair of coarctation and VSD (n = 1), orthotopic heart transplant (n = 1), repair of VSD (n = 1), and patent ductus arteriosus ligation (n = 1). The average age at discharge was 28 +/- 21 days. Four patients (6%) failed car safety seat testing because of a fall in oxygen saturation.

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study was to expand the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) car safety seat testing recommendation to include high-risk infants following cardiac surgery. Car safety seat testing (< or =4 days prior to discharge) was retrospectively reviewed for 66 postoperative infants. Car safety seat testing was performed according to AAP guidelines. Failure of the test was defined as the occurrence of apnea, bradycardia, or oxygen desaturation. Average birth weight was 3.1 +/- 0.5 kg. Two patients were born <37 weeks of gestation. Surgical procedures included modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (15), arterial switch operation (12), Norwood-Sano modification (11), coarctation repair (8), repair of tetralogy of Fallot (6), repair of truncus arteriosus (4), repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous return (3), pacemaker (2), repair of interrupted aortic arch and ventricular septal defect (VSD) (1), repair of coarctation/VSD (1), orthotopic heart transplant (1), repair of VSD (1), and patent ductus arteriosus ligation (1). Average age at discharge was 28 +/- 21 days. Four patients (6%) failed car safety seat testing secondary to a decrease in oxygen saturation. One of four passed on retesting after parental education; three of 4 (75%) were discharged home in a supine car safety seat. There was no relationship between the type of surgery and car safety seat test failure. It may be beneficial to extend the AAP recommendations for car safety seat testing to include this high-risk patient population.},

  Abstract                 = {We report our experience and long-term outcome of pediatric renal transplantation at a referral center in New Delhi. During 1995-2008, 45 transplants were performed in 43 patients at a mean age of 13.3 +/- 4.0 (range 3.8-18) yr. The chief causes for ESRD were reflux nephropathy, obstructive uropathy, vasculitis, renal dysplasia, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Most (91.1%) donors were living related. Post-transplant immunosuppression comprised prednisolone, a calcineurin inhibitor and azathioprine or MMF. AR and CR were seen in 14 (31.1%) and 12 (26.7%) allografts, respectively. Predictors of CR were unsatisfactory compliance and multiple episodes of AR (p = 0.002 each). Urinary infections (n = 13), septicemia (4), tuberculosis (4), CMV disease (7), viral hepatitis (7), and pneumonia (3) were important causes of morbidity. Two patients each had lymphoproliferative disease and new-onset diabetes. There were eight (17.8%) graft losses and six (14%) deaths. The one-, five- and 10-yr graft survivals were 91.1%, 80.4% and 75.1%, respectively; the mean graft survival was 119.4 +/- 8.38 months. The respective patient survivals were 95.3%, 87.9%, and 76.9% at one-, five- and 10 yr. Our results affirm that despite scarcity of resources and frequent infections, long-term outcomes of pediatric renal transplantation are highly satisfactory.},

  Abstract                 = {Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are the most prevalent forms of anemia and often occur concurrently. Standard tests of iron status used in differential diagnosis are affected by inflammation, hindering clinical interpretation. In contrast, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) indicates iron deficiency and is unaffected by inflammation. Objectives of this prospective multicenter clinical trial were to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of sTfR and the sTfR/log ferritin index (sTfR Index) for differential diagnosis using the automated Access((R)) sTfR assay (Beckman Coulter) and sTfR Index. We consecutively enrolled 145 anemic patients with common disorders associated with IDA and ACD. Subjects with IDA or ACD + IDA had significantly higher sTfR and sTfR Index values than subjects with ACD (P < 0.0001). ROC curves produced the following cutoffs for sTfR: 21 nmol/L (or 1.55 mg/L), and the sTfR Index: 14 (using nmol/L) (or 1.03 using mg/L). The sTfR Index was superior to sTfR (AUC 0.87 vs. 0.74, P < 0.0001). Use of all three parameters in combination more than doubled the detection of IDA, from 41% (ferritin alone) to 92% (ferritin, sTfR, sTfR Index). Use of sTfR and the sTfR Index improves detection of IDA, particularly in situations where routine markers provide equivocal results. Findings demonstrate a significant advantage in the simultaneous determination of ferritin, sTfR and sTfR Index. Obtaining a ferritin level alone may delay diagnosis of combined IDA and ACD.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To study cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption in severe head-injured children and also to assess the effect of hyperventilation on regional cerebral blood flow. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit at a tertiary-level university children's hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three children with isolated severe brain injury, whose admission Glasgow Coma Scores were <8. INTERVENTIONS: PaCO2 was adjusted by altering minute ventilation. Cerebral metabolic measurements were made at three levels of PaCO2 (>35, 25 to 35, and <25 torr [>4.7, 3.3 to 4.7, and <3.3 kPa]) after allowing 15 mins for equilibrium. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies (each study consisting of three sets of measurements at different levels of PaCO2) were performed on 23 patients. At each level of PaCO2, the following measurements were made: xenon-enhanced computed tomography scans; cerebral blood flow; intracranial pressure; jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation; mean arterial pressure; and arterial oxygen saturation. Derived variables included: cerebral oxygen consumption; cerebral perfusion pressure; and oxygen extraction ratio. Cerebral blood flow decreased below normal after head injury (mean 49.6 +/- 14.6 mL/min/100 g). Cerebral oxygen consumption decreased out of proportion to the decrease in cerebral blood flow; cerebral oxygen consumption was only a third of the normal range (mean 1.02 +/- 0.59 mL/min/100 g). Neither cerebral blood flow nor cerebral oxygen consumption showed any relationship to time after injury, Glasgow Coma Score at the time of presentation, or intracranial pressure. The frequency of one or more regions of ischemia (defined as cerebral blood flow of <18 mL/min/100 g) was 28.9% during normocapnia. This value increased to 73.1% for PaCO2 at <25 torr. CONCLUSIONS: Severe head injury in children produced a modest decrease in cerebral blood flow but a much larger decrease in cerebral oxygen consumption. Absolute hyperemia was uncommon at any time, but measured cerebral blood flow rates were still above the metabolic requirements of most children. The clear relationship between the frequency of cerebral ischemia and hypocarbia, combined with the rarity of hyperemia, suggests that hyperventilation should be used with caution and monitored carefully in children with severe head injuries.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of snowmobile injuries in Utah. METHODS: Analysis of probabilistically linked statewide emergency department (ED), hospital admission, and death certificate data for 1996 and 1997. RESULTS: There were 625 cases of snowmobile-related injuries. The majority (83%) were evaluated in the ED only. Median ED patient age was 29 years (range 3-74 years), and 66% were male. The leading diagnoses were open wounds to the head (7.8%), back strains (5.4%), and contusions of the trunk and lower extremities (5.2% and 5.0%, respectively). An Injury Severity Score (ISS) of > or = 4 (range 1-75) was found in 37% of the ED patients. The median charge was $373 per patient, with two-year cumulative charges of $266,283. One hundred seven patients required inpatient hospital care. Median inpatient age was 32 years (range 4-92 years), and 60% were male. Leading inpatient diagnoses were fracture of the vertebral column (9.3%), lower extremity fracture (9.3%), upper extremity fracture (6.5%), and pelvis fracture (3.7%). An ISS of > or = 4 (range 1-38) was found in 70% of the hospitalized patients. Average length of stay was 3 days, with a range of 1 to 68 days. Median inpatient charge was $6,003 per patient, with two-year cumulative charges of $1,333,218. Ten inpatients required transfer for rehabilitation or skilled nursing care. There were a total of six fatalities, three of which occurred in the ED, one in the inpatient population, and two identified from the death certificate database. CONCLUSIONS: By combining ED, inpatient, and death certificate data sets, probabilistic linkage provides a comprehensive description of snowmobile-related injuries and a baseline evaluation of morbidity, mortality, and financial burden.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of the Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM), PIM2, the Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM), and PRISM III in Australia and New Zealand. DESIGN: A two-phase prospective observational study. Phase 1 assessed the performance of PIM, PRISM, and PRISM III between 1997 and 1999. Phase 2 assessed PIM2 in 2000 and 2001. SETTING: Ten intensive care units in Australia and New Zealand. PATIENTS: Included in the study were 26,966 patients aged <16 yrs; 1,147 patients died in the intensive care unit. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Discrimination between death and survival was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic plot for each model. The areas (95% confidence interval) for PIM, PIM2, PRISM, and PRISM III were 0.89 (0.88-0.90), 0.90 (0.88-0.91), 0.90 (0.89-0.91), and 0.93 (0.92-0.94). The calibration of the models was assessed by comparing the number of observed to predicted deaths in different diagnostic and risk groups. Prediction was best using PIM2 with no difference between observed and expected mortality (standardized mortality ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.97 [0.86-1.05]). PIM, PRISM III, and PRISM all overpredicted death, predicting 116%, 130%, and 189% of observed deaths, respectively. The performance of individual units was compared during phase 1, using PIM, PRISM, and PRISM III. There was agreement between the models in the identification of outlying units; two units performed better than expected and one unit worse than expected for each model. CONCLUSIONS: Of the models tested, PIM2 was the most accurate and had the best fit in different diagnostic and risk groups; therefore, it is the most suitable mortality prediction model to use for monitoring the quality of pediatric intensive care in Australia and New Zealand. More information about the performance of the models in other regions is required before these results can be generalized.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Children with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) show early neurobehavioral deficits that can persist several years after injury. Despite the negative impact that TBI can have on a child's physical, cognitive, and psychosocial well-being, only 1 study to date has documented the receipt of health care services after acute care and the needs of children after TBI. The purpose of this study was to document the health care use and needs of children after a TBI and to identify factors that are associated with unmet or unrecognized health care needs during the first year after injury. METHODS: The health care use and needs of children who sustained a TBI were obtained via telephone interview with a primary caregiver at 2 and 12 months after injury. Of the 330 who enrolled in the study, 302 (92%) completed the 3-month and 288 (87%) completed the 12-month follow-up interviews. The health care needs of each child were categorized as no need, met need, unmet need, or unrecognized need on the basis of the child's use of post-acute services, the caregiver's report of unmet need, and the caregiver's report of the child's functioning as measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). Regardless of the use of services or level of function, children of caregivers who reported an unmet need for a health care service were defined as having unmet need. Children who were categorized as having no needs were defined as those who did not receive services; whose caregiver did not report unmet need for a service; and the whose physical, socioemotional, and cognitive functioning was reported to be normal by the caregiver. Children with met needs were those who used services in a particular domain and whose caregivers did not report need for additional services. Finally, children with unrecognized needs were those whose caregiver reported cognitive, physical, or socioemotional dysfunction; who were not receiving services to address the dysfunction; and whose caregiver did not report unmet need for services. Polytomous logistic regression was used to model unmet and unrecognized need at 3 and 12 months after injury as a function of child, family, and injury characteristics. RESULTS: At 3 months after injury, 62% of the study sample reported receiving at least 1 outpatient health care service. Most frequently, children visited a doctor (56%) or a physical therapist (27%); however, 37% of caregivers reported that their child did not see a physician at all during the first year after injury. At 3 and 12 months after injury, 26% and 31% of children, respectively, had unmet/unrecognized health care needs. The most frequent type of unmet or unrecognized need was for cognitive services. The top 3 reasons for unmet need at 3 and 12 months were (1) not recommended by doctor (34% and 31%); (2) not recommended/provided by school (16% and 17%); and (3) cost too much (16% and 16%). Factors that were associated with unmet or unrecognized need changed over time. At 3 months after injury, the caregivers of children with a preexisting psychosocial condition were 3 times more likely to report unmet need compared with children who did not have one. Also, female caregivers were significantly more likely to report unmet need compared with male caregivers. Finally, the caregivers of children with Medicaid were almost 2 times more likely to report unmet need compared with children who were covered by commercial insurance. The only factor that was associated with unrecognized need at 3 months after injury was abnormal family functioning. At 12 months after injury, although TBI severity was not significant, children who sustained a major associated injury were 2 times more likely to report unmet need compared with children who did not. Consistent with the 3-month results, the caregivers of children with Medicaid were significantly more likely to report unmet needs at 1 year after injury. In addition to poor family functioning's being associated with unrecognized need, nonwhite children were significantly more likely to have unrecognized needs at 1 year compared with white children. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of children with TBI had unmet or unrecognized health care needs during the first year after injury. It is recommended that pediatricians be involved in the post-acute care follow-up of children with TBI to ensure that the injured child's needs are being addressed in a timely and appropriate manner. One of the recommendations that trauma center providers should make on hospital discharge is that the parent/primary caregiver schedule a visit with the child's pediatrician regardless of the post-acute services that the child may be receiving. Because unmet and unrecognized need was highest for cognitive services, it is important to screen for cognitive dysfunction in the primary care setting. Finally, because the health care needs of children with TBI change over time, it is important for pediatricians to monitor their recovery to ensure that children with TBI receive the services that they need to restore their health after injury.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Blood product transfusions are a valuable health-care resource. Guidelines for transfusion exist, but variability in their application, particularly in children, remains. The risk factors that threaten transfusion safety are well established, but because their occurrence in children is rare, single-institution studies have limited utility in determining the rates of occurrence. An epidemiologic approach that investigates blood transfusions in hospitalized children may help improve our understanding of transfused blood products in this vulnerable population. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a nonconcurrent cohort study of pediatric patients not more than 18 years of age hospitalized from 2001 to 2003 at 35 academic children's hospitals that are members of the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS). RESULTS: A total of 51,720 (4.8%) pediatric patients received blood product transfusions during the study period. Red blood cells (n = 44,632) and platelets (n = 14,274) were the two most frequently transfused products. The rate of transfusions was highest among children with neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and sickle cell crisis. Asian and American Indian patients had important differences in the rate of blood transfusions and their complications. Resource use in terms of length of stay and costs were higher in patients who received transfusion. Of those patients who received transfusions, 492 (0.95%) experienced a complication from the administered blood product. This accounted for a rate of complications of 10.7 per 1,000 units transfused. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of blood products to children is a common practice in academic children's hospitals. Complications associated with these transfused products are rare.},

The primary outcome was death. Patient characteristics including age, gender, race, diagnostic grouping, and insurance status and epidemiological measures including standardized mortality rate and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were used.A total of 427 615 patients were discharged during the study period, of whom 4529 (1.1\%) died. Neonates had the highest mortality rate (4.03\%; odds ratio: 8.66; P < .001), followed by patients >18 years of age (1.4\%; odds ratio: 2.86; P < .001). The SMRs ranged from 0.46 (all patient-refined, diagnosis-related group 663, other anemias and disorders of blood) to 30.0 (all patient-refined, diagnosis-related group 383, cellulitis and other bacterial skin infections). When deaths were compared according to institution, there was considerable variability in both the number of children who died and the SMRs at those institutions.Patient characteristics, such as age, severity, and diagnosis, were all substantive factors associated with the death of children. Opportunities to improve the environment of care by reducing variability within and between hospitals may improve mortality rates for hospitalized children.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the rates, patient, and institutional characteristics associated with the occurrence of patient safety indicators (PSIs) in hospitalized children and the degree of statistical difference derived from using three approaches of controlling for institution level effects. DATA SOURCE: Pediatric Health Information System Dataset consisting of all pediatric discharges (<21 years of age) from 34 academic, freestanding children's hospitals for calendar year 2003. METHODS: The rates of PSIs were computed for all discharges. The patient and institutional characteristics associated with these PSIs were calculated. The analyses sequentially applied three increasingly conservative methods to control for the institution-level effects robust standard error estimation, a fixed effects model, and a random effects model. The degree of difference from a "base state," which excluded institution-level variables, and between the models was calculated. The effects of these analyses on the interpretation of the PSIs are presented. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PSIs are relatively infrequent events in hospitalized children ranging from 0 per 10,000 (postoperative hip fracture) to 87 per 10,000 (postoperative respiratory failure). Significant variables associated PSIs included age (neonates), race (Caucasians), payor status (public insurance), severity of illness (extreme), and hospital size (>300 beds), which all had higher rates of PSIs than their reference groups in the bivariable logistic regression results. The three different approaches of adjusting for institution-level effects demonstrated that there were similarities in both the clinical and statistical significance across each of the models. CONCLUSIONS: Institution-level effects can be appropriately controlled for by using a variety of methods in the analyses of administrative data. Whenever possible, resource-conservative methods should be used in the analyses especially if clinical implications are minimal.},

In an uncontrolled, prospective study, we evaluated whether adherence to high-protein and low-carbohydrate nutrition and exercise therapy (NET) can slow the progressive deterioration of muscle function in this disease. Thirty-four patients have been treated with NET for periods of 2-10 years (mean 4.5 +/- 2.5). Pre-NET rate of muscle function deterioration, as measured by the Walton scale, was compared to post-NET rate. Twenty-six patients were deemed to be consistently compliant with NET. Difference between pre-NET slope of muscle function deterioration to that of post-NET slope in compliant patients was -0.29 (95% CI -0.19, 0.39) (P < 0.0001). We conclude that compliance with NET can slow deterioration of muscle function and improve the natural history of adult-onset acid maltase deficiency. Muscle Nerve, 2006.},

  Abstract                 = {Secondary analyses of large datasets provide a mechanism for researchers to address high impact questions that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to study. This paper presents a guide to assist investigators interested in conducting secondary data analysis, including advice on the process of successful secondary data analysis as well as a brief summary of high-value datasets and online resources for researchers, including the SGIM dataset compendium ( www.sgim.org/go/datasets ). The same basic research principles that apply to primary data analysis apply to secondary data analysis, including the development of a clear and clinically relevant research question, study sample, appropriate measures, and a thoughtful analytic approach. A real-world case description illustrates key steps: (1) define your research topic and question; (2) select a dataset; (3) get to know your dataset; and (4) structure your analysis and presentation of findings in a way that is clinically meaningful. Secondary dataset analysis is a well-established methodology. Secondary analysis is particularly valuable for junior investigators, who have limited time and resources to demonstrate expertise and productivity.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between hyperglycemia and outcome in infants and children after severe traumatic brain injury. DESIGN: Retrospective review of a prospectively collected Pediatric Neurotrauma Registry. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Children admitted after severe traumatic brain injury (postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale </= 8) were studied (1999-2004). A subset of children (n = 28) were concurrently enrolled in a randomized, controlled clinical trial of early hypothermia for neuroprotection. INTERVENTIONS: Demographic data, serum glucose concentrations, and outcome assessments were collected. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS: Children (n = 57) were treated with a standard traumatic brain injury protocol. Exogenous glucose was withheld for 48 hrs after injury unless hypoglycemia was observed (blood glucose <70 mg/dL). Early (first 48 hrs) and Late (49-168 hrs) time periods were defined and mean blood glucose concentrations were calculated. Additionally, children were categorized based on peak blood glucose concentrations during each time period (normal, blood glucose <150 mg/dL; mild hyperglycemia, blood glucose </= 200 mg/dL; severe hyperglycemia, blood glucose >200 mg/dL). In the Late period, an association between elevated mean serum glucose concentration and outcome was observed (133.5 +/- 5.6 mg/dL in the unfavorable group vs. 115.4 +/- 4.1 mg/dL in favorable group, p = .02). This association continued to be significant after correcting for injury severity, age, and exposure to insulin (p = .03). Similarly, in the Late period, children within the severe hyperglycemia group had decreased incidence of good outcome compared to children within the other glycemic groups (% good outcome: normal, 61.9%; mild hyperglycemia, 73.7%; severe hyperglycemia, 33.3%; p = .05). However, when adjusted for exposure to insulin, this relationship was no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In children with severe traumatic brain injury, hyperglycemia beyond the initial 48 hrs is associated with poor outcome. This relationship was observed in both our analysis of mean blood glucose concentrations as well as among the patients with episodic severe hyperglycemia. This observation suggests a relationship between hyperglycemia and outcome from traumatic brain injury. However, only a prospective study can answer the important question of whether manipulating serum glucose concentration can improve outcome after traumatic brain injury in children.},

While this could be expected to improve the outcome from major injury, current data does not support this. Indeed, prehospital interventions beyond the BLS level have not been shown to be effective and in many cases have proven to be detrimental to patient outcome. It is better to "scoop and run" than "stay and play". Current data relates to the urban environment where transport times to trauma centres are short and where it appears better to simply rapidly transport the patient to hospital than attempt major interventions at the scene. There may be more need for advanced techniques in the rural environment or where transport times are prolonged and certainly a need for more studies into subsets of patients who may benefit from interventions in the field.},

  Abstract                 = {Straight leg raising (SLR) is a useful clinical test to demonstrate an inflammatory compressive process across a spinal nerve root. Several previous studies have attempted to evaluate the effect of SLR on nerve root motion, but the exact direction and amount of this motion is still unclear. Components of the SLR test that have not been adequately addressed include the effect of SLR on the intact dural-nerve root system, motion of the nerve tissues as distinct from the dura, and nerve root strain. Separately, spinal fusion is occasionally used as an adjunct to discectomy to decrease instability and subsequent "nerve root irritation." The effect of a one-level fusion on in situ nerve root biomechanics, however, has not been evaluated. Ten fresh human cadavers underwent posterior lumbar laminectomies. Spinal nerve root motion was studied while a SLR maneuver was performed. Data was recorded photographically and statistically analyzed. The results were as follows: 1) SLR induced both linear motion (0.5-5 mm) and strain (2-4%) in spinal nerves L4, L5, and S1; 2) The dura moved less than the intrathecal nerve root at the pedicle and experienced more strain (P < .05). 3) The nerve roots moved laterally toward the pedicle and thus would move into a posterolaterally herniated disc. 4) Rigid anterior stabilization did not decrease nerve root motion or strain.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:: A growing body of evidence suggests that long-term survivors with 1 of the more common forms of adult cancer report a quality of life (QOL) similar to that in the general population. However, specific concerns have been identified (sexual dysfunction, fatigue, distress) in this population. Also, less is known concerning survivors of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a disease often marked by alternating periods of disease and remission. Therefore, in the current study, the authors compared the QOL status of individuals who reported having active NHL with the QOL status of individuals who were disease-free short-term survivors (STS) (2-4 years postdiagnosis) and long-term survivors (LTS) (> or =5 years postdiagnosis). METHODS: Eligible survivors completed a mailed survey with validated measures, including physical and mental health status measured with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form, cancer-related QOL, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma module, and self-reported impact of cancer. Other data were collected to examine as correlates. RESULTS:: Seven hundred sixty-one survivors identified from 2 North Carolina cancer registries participated. The average survivor was 10.4 years postdiagnosis (range, 2-44 years postdiagnosis) and was age 62.7 years (range, 25-92 years). Survivors with active disease (n = 109) demonstrated worse physical and mental health functioning, worse QOL, and less positive and more negative impacts of cancer compared with disease-free survivors (n = 652; all P < or = .01). No significant differences were observed between STS and LTS. CONCLUSIONS: Although survivors with NHL who had active disease reported more negative outcomes compared with off-treatment survivors, the length of time after diagnosis did not appear to matter with regard to outcomes for STS or LTS. In addition, mixed results from comparisons with general population norms suggested the need for supportive care for this diverse survivorship group.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to analyze trends in admissions and to describe therapies used for acute Kawasaki disease over a 6-year period. METHODS: The Pediatric Health Information System provides patient data including demographic variables, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes, and services billed to patients. Patient identifiers enable tracking of medication use in and across multiple admissions within a center. We analyzed data for patients with (1) a diagnosis code for Kawasaki disease, (2) intravenously administered immunoglobulin treatment during hospitalization, and (3) discharge between January 1, 2001, and December 30, 2006, from 27 hospitals contributing complete data over the study period. RESULTS: During the study period, 5197 Kawasaki disease admissions were identified for 4811 patients; numbers increased 32.6% from 2001 (n = 678) to 2006 (n = 899). Retreatment with intravenous immunoglobulin was administered to 712 patients (14.8%) over the study period. Other antiinflammatory therapies included intravenously administered methylprednisolone (5.8%), orally administered prednisone (2.8%), and infliximab (1%). Use of infliximab steadily increased from 0.0% (0 of 678 patients) in 2001 to 2.3% (21 of 899 patients) in 2006. Coronary artery aneurysms were coded for 3.3% of patients. Male patients, patients <1 year of age, and Hispanic patients were significantly more likely to have coding for coronary artery aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS: Our report provides the first large multicenter description of agents used in the treatment of intravenously administered immunoglobulin-resistant Kawasaki disease in the United States. Trends include increased numbers of admissions attributable to Kawasaki disease and increased usage of infliximab.},

  Abstract                 = {With the efficacy and costs of medications rising rapidly, it is increasingly important to ensure that drugs be prescribed as rationally as possible. Yet, physicians' choices of drugs frequently fall short of the ideal of precise and cost-effective decision making. Evidence indicates that such decisions can be improved in a variety of ways. A number of theories and principles of communication and behavior changes can be found that underlie the success of pharmaceutical manufacturers in influencing prescribing practices. Based on this behavioral science and several field trials, it is possible to define the theory and practice of methods to improve physicians' clinical decision making to enhance the quality and cost-effectiveness of care. Some of the most important techniques of such "academic detailing" include (1) conducting interviews to investigate baseline knowledge and motivations for current prescribing patterns, (2) focusing programs on specific categories of physicians as well as on their opinion leaders, (3) defining clear educational and behavioral objectives, (4) establishing credibility through a respected organizational identity, referencing authoritative and unbiased sources of information, and presenting both sides of controversial issues, (5) stimulating active physician participation in educational interactions, (6) using concise graphic educational materials, (7) highlighting and repeating the essential messages, and (8) providing positive reinforcement of improved practices in follow-up visits. Used by the nonprofit sector, the above techniques have been shown to reduce inappropriate prescribing as well as unnecessary health care expenditures.},

  Abstract                 = {In analyzing a university-based program to educate physicians about proper medication use, we sought to measure whether physician background characteristics and the quality or number of educational exposures influenced the rate of relinquishment of inappropriate prescribing. A sample of 435 doctors was randomized to control and experimental groups; interventions consisted of printed educational materials and face-to-face visits by clinical pharmacists. The program sought to reduce inappropriate use of three drug categories: propoxyphene, peripheral/cerebral vasodilators, and cephalexin. Outcome data included the total volume (tablets/capsules) of these drugs prescribed through Medicaid by each study physician 9 months before and after the program. We estimated average changes in prescribing levels by experimental and control physicians within each physician subgroup (e.g., board-certified versus uncertified), adjusting for prescribing level in the same 9 months of the previous year. The results indicated that the rate of prescribing change was independent of most physician background characteristics studied, including age, board certification, specialty, rural versus urban practice, intensity of previous target drug use, and size of Medicaid practice. Experimental effects were highly significant (-9% to -20%, P less than 0.025) in 11 of 14 physician subgroups. The presence of a follow-up reinforcement visit was a strong independent predictor of prescribing change (P less than 0.05). An increase from one visit to two visits was associated with an approximate doubling of the size of the program effect. However, total exposure time was not related to changes in prescribing behavior. These findings document that face to face education can be effective in improving the prescribing practices of a wide variety of physicians, and that brevity, repetition, and reinforcement of recommended practices are important components in the design of such programs.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyzed trends in prescribing and overdose deaths related to propoxyphene (e.g., Darvon) before and after a 1978-80 informational campaign carried out by the US Food and Drug Administration and the drug's manufacturer through mailed warnings, face-to-face education of prescribers, press releases, and labeling changes. The goals included a reduction in propoxyphene use with alcohol or other CNS depressants, reduced prescribing of refills, and cessation of prescribing for patients at risk of abuse and misuse (suicide). We conducted time-series analyses of nationwide propoxyphene use data 1974-83 and analyzed data on drug overdose death rates covering a combined population of about 83 million. Segmented regression methods were used to determine if the informational program was associated with changes in trends of prescribing or overdose deaths. Comparison drug series were analyzed to control for other secular trends in prescribing. Nationwide propoxyphene use during the warnings continued a pre-existing decline of about 8 per cent per year, but this decline halted after the warnings. The no-refill recommendation had no impact on refill rates. The risk of overdose death per propoxyphene prescription filled has remained about constant since 1979. Sharper declines in misuse of such drugs will require stronger, more sustained regulatory or educational measures.},

  Abstract                 = {In an attempt to contain costs, 27 Medicaid programs have implemented patient-level payment limits for medications, but the effects of these restrictions on quality of care, costs, and health status remain largely unknown. We measured the effect of one state's limit of three paid prescriptions per month and its replacement a year later by a $1 copayment. Using data on 48 months of claims in the study state (New Hampshire) and a comparison state (New Jersey), we employed time-series analysis to evaluate patient-level changes in the number of prescriptions filled for 16 drugs that varied in their clinical importance and cost. Among 10,734 continuously enrolled patients, the limit of three paid prescriptions per month caused a sudden, sustained drop of 30 percent in the number of prescriptions filled (from 1.10 to 0.77 prescriptions per patient per month); no change was observed in the comparison state. The 860 recipients of multiple drugs, who were predominantly female and elderly or disabled, were most severely affected; the number of prescriptions per month dropped from 5.2 to 2.8 (46 percent). The decrease was greatest for "ineffective drugs" (58 percent), but large drops were also observed for "essential" medications, such as insulin (28 percent), thiazides (28 percent), and furosemide (30 percent). Reductions in Medicaid prescriptions were minimally offset by increases in the size of the prescription or in out-of-pocket payments. When a $1 copayment replaced the three-prescription cap, prescriptions for most medications increased to just below precap levels. Medicaid's savings on drug costs resulting from both policies were comparable ($0.4 to $0.8 million annually), but the copayment policy had less effect on patients receiving multiple drugs. Because the clinical consequences of such policies cannot be assessed from prescription data alone, further study is needed to determine the effects of cost-containment strategies on health status and the use of other services among poor populations.},

  Abstract                 = {This article reports the results of a critical analysis of English-language studies describing programs designed to improve physician prescribing behavior in primary care settings. Only 64% of studies met minimum research design standards, and are the basis for the results reported. The overall findings of the review confirm the conclusions of a previous evaluation of hospital-based studies. (1) The simple dissemination of printed educational materials had no detectable effect on prescribing practice when used alone in well-controlled studies. However, such educational materials do lay a necessary foundation for more personalized educational efforts. (2) Merely distributing computerized listings of patient-specific medication profiles, without specific recommendations for change, is ineffective in reducing overall drug costs or use of inappropriate drugs. Their lack of effect may be due to the large quantity and clinical irrelevance of such data. (3) Continuous computerized reminder systems have been shown to prevent omission of essential care, although such systems are effective only as long as reminders continue. This strategy has not been evaluated for its potential to reduce excessive or inappropriate drug prescribing. (4) Repeated feedback to physicians with specific suggestions for alternative agents has been shown to increase use of generic drugs in academic group practice settings. No adequate studies have tested whether this approach might reduce other types of misprescribing. Also in academic primary care settings, small group tutorials have been shown to improve use of antibiotics and hypertension treatment control. (5) A substantial literature in the U.S. and Canada supports the conclusion that brief, face-to-face educational outreach visits, conducted by either specially trained clinical pharmacists or physician "counsellors" and "opinion leaders", are effective in reducing prescribing of inefficient or contraindicated drugs in pediatric and adult primary care settings. These face-to-face approaches emphasize a tactful, supportive and facilitative role; in some cases, emphasis is put on helping physicians overcome barriers to appropriate prescribing (e.g. patient demand or addiction to minor tranquilizers). Most effective programs also utilize professionally credible sponsors and high-quality educational materials. In addition to improving quality, some programs have been found to produce savings in drug use which exceed the operational costs of the program.},

  Abstract                 = {Little is known about the effect on clinical decision making of nonreimbursement for ineffective medical technologies. Using a time-series design, we studied the effects of cessation of government payment for 12 categories of drugs of questionable efficacy (Drug Efficacy Study Implementation drugs) in a random sample of the New Jersey Medicaid population (N=390 465) and in four cohorts of regular users of these products. We measured changes in the overall levels of prescriptions, expenditures, and physicians' use of substitute drugs. Although withdrawn drugs accounted for 7% of prescriptions in the base year, there was no measurable reduction in overall drug use or expenditures after the regulation; prescription rates actually rose from 0.86 to 1.00 monthly prescriptions per enrollee throughout the 42-month study. Controlling for preexisting trends, an estimated drop in the use of study drugs of 21.7 prescriptions per 1000 enrollees per month was offset by an increase in the use of substitute drugs of 33.7 prescriptions. Both desirable and unimproved therapeutic substitutions were observed. Used alone, curtailment of reimbursement for marginally effective therapies results in both desirable and unintended clinical substitutions and may not reduce costs. Supplementing such restrictions with education may be necessary to promote practices that are more therapeutically and economically appropriate.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Hydrocortisone is widely used in patients with septic shock even though a survival benefit has been reported only in patients who remained hypotensive after fluid and vasopressor resuscitation and whose plasma cortisol levels did not rise appropriately after the administration of corticotropin. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned 251 patients to receive 50 mg of intravenous hydrocortisone and 248 patients to receive placebo every 6 hours for 5 days; the dose was then tapered during a 6-day period. At 28 days, the primary outcome was death among patients who did not have a response to a corticotropin test. RESULTS: Of the 499 patients in the study, 233 (46.7%) did not have a response to corticotropin (125 in the hydrocortisone group and 108 in the placebo group). At 28 days, there was no significant difference in mortality between patients in the two study groups who did not have a response to corticotropin (39.2% in the hydrocortisone group and 36.1% in the placebo group, P=0.69) or between those who had a response to corticotropin (28.8% in the hydrocortisone group and 28.7% in the placebo group, P=1.00). At 28 days, 86 of 251 patients in the hydrocortisone group (34.3%) and 78 of 248 patients in the placebo group (31.5%) had died (P=0.51). In the hydrocortisone group, shock was reversed more quickly than in the placebo group. However, there were more episodes of superinfection, including new sepsis and septic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrocortisone did not improve survival or reversal of shock in patients with septic shock, either overall or in patients who did not have a response to corticotropin, although hydrocortisone hastened reversal of shock in patients in whom shock was reversed.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of fundoplication on reflux related hospital admissions for children with neurological impairment. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational cohort study. Setting 42 children's hospitals in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 3721 children with neurological impairment born between 2000 and 2005 who had at least one hospital admission at a study hospital before their fundoplication. INTERVENTION: Fundoplication. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident rate ratio for reflux related hospital admissions, defined as the post-fundoplication admission rate divided by the pre-fundoplication admission rate. RESULTS: Of the 955 285 children born during the study period, 144,749 (15%) had neurological impairment. Of these, 27,720 (19%) were diagnosed as having gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, of whom 6716 (24%) had a fundoplication. Of these, 3721 (55%) had at least one previous hospital admission and were included in the study cohort. After fundoplication, hospital admissions decreased for any reflux related cause (incident rate ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.72; P<0.01), aspiration pneumonia (0.71, 0.62 to 0.81; P<0.01), gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (0.60, 0.57 to 0.63; P<0.01), and mechanical ventilation (0.40, 0.37 to 0.43; P<0.01), after adjustment for other patient and hospital related factors that may influence reflux related hospital admissions. Hospital admissions increased for asthma (incident rate ratio 1.52, 1.38 to 1.67; P<0.01) and remained constant for pneumonia (1.07, 0.98 to 1.17; P=0.16). Conclusions Children with neurological impairment who have fundoplication had reduced short term reflux related hospital admissions for aspiration pneumonia, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and mechanical ventilation. However, admissions for pneumonia remained constant and those for asthma increased after fundoplication. Comparative effectiveness data for other treatments (such as gastrojejunal feeding tubes) are unknown.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Children with neurological impairment (NI) commonly have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) treated with a fundoplication. The impact of this procedure on quality of life is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: To examine the quality of life of children with NI who have received a fundoplication for GERD and of their caregivers. METHODS: The study was a prospective cohort study of children with NI and GERD who underwent a fundoplication at a children's hospital between January 1, 2005, and July 7, 2006. Quality of life of the children was assessed with the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) and of the caregivers with the Short-Form Health Survey Status (SF-36) and Parenting Stress Index (PSI), both at baseline and 1 month after fundoplication. Functional status was assessed using the WeeFIM. Repeated-measures analyses were performed. RESULTS: Forty-four of the 63 parents (70%) were enrolled. The median WeeFIM score was 31.2 versus the age-normal score of 83 (P = .001). Compared with the baseline scores, mean CHQ scores improved over 1 month in the domains of bodily pain (32.8 vs. 47.5, P = .01), role limitations-physical (30.6 vs. 56.6, P = .01), mental health (62.7 vs. 70.6, P = .01), family limitation of activities (43.3 vs. 55.1, P = .03), and parental time (43.0 vs. 55.3, P = .03). The parental SF-36 domain of vitality improved from baseline over 1 month (41.3 vs. 48.2, P = .001), but there were no changes from baseline in Parenting Stress scores. CONCLUSIONS: Parents reported that the quality of life of children with NI who receive a fundoplication for GERD was improved from baseline in several domains 1 month after surgery. The quality of life and stress of caregivers did not improve in nearly all domains, at least in the short term.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Aspiration pneumonia is the most common cause of death in children with neurologic impairment who have gastroesophageal reflux disease. Fundoplications and gastrojejunal feeding tubes are frequently employed to prevent aspiration pneumonia in this population. Which of these approaches is more effective in preventing aspiration pneumonia and/or improving survival is unknown. The objective of this study was to compare outcomes for children with neurologic impairment and gastroesophageal reflux disease after either a first fundoplication or a first gastrojejunal feeding tube. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study of children with neurologic impairment who had either a fundoplication or gastrojejunal feeding tube between January 1997 and December 2005 at a tertiary care children's hospital. Main outcome measures were postprocedure aspiration pneumonia-free survival and mortality. Propensity analyses were used to control for bias in treatment assignment and prognostic imbalances. RESULTS: Of the 366 children with neurologic impairment and gastroesophageal reflux disease, 43 had a first gastrojejunal feeding tube and 323 underwent a first fundoplication. Median length of follow-up was 3.4 years. Children who received a first fundoplication had similar rates of aspiration pneumonia and mortality after the procedure compared with those who had a first gastrojejunal feeding tube, when adjusting for the treatment assignment using propensity scores. CONCLUSIONS: Aspiration pneumonia and mortality are not uncommon events after either a first fundoplication or a first gastrojejunal feeding tube for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children with neurologic impairment. Neither treatment option is clearly superior in preventing the subsequent aspiration pneumonia or improving overall survival for these children. This complex clinical scenario needs to be studied in a prospective, multicenter, randomized control trial to evaluate definitively whether 1 of these 2 management options is more beneficial.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Delays in discharges affect both efficiency and timeliness of care; 2 measures of quality of inpatient care. OBJECTIVE: Describe number, length, and type of delays in hospital discharges. Characterize impact of delays on overall length of stay (LOS) and costs. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary-care children's hospital. PATIENTS: All children on 2 medical teams during August 2004. INTERVENTION: Two research assistants presented detailed data of patient care (from daily rounds) to 2 physicians who identified delays and classified the delay type. Discharge was identified as delayed if there was no medical reason for the patient to be in the hospital on a given day. MEASUREMENTS: Delays were classified using a validated and reliable instrument, the Delay Tool. LOS and costs were extracted from an administrative database. RESULTS: Two teams cared for 171 patients. Mean LOS and costs were 7.3 days (standard deviation [SD] 14.3) and $15,197 (SD 38,395), respectively: 22.8% of patients experienced at least 1 delay, accounting for 82 delay-related hospital days (9% of total hospital days) and $170,000 in costs (8.9% of hospital costs); 42.3% of the delays resulted from physician behavior, 21.8% were related to discharge planning, 14.1% were related to consultation, and 12.8% were related to test scheduling. CONCLUSIONS: Almost one-fourth of patients in this 1-month period could have been discharged sooner than they were. Impact of delays on LOS and costs are substantial. Interventions will need to address variations in physician criteria for discharge, more efficient discharge planning, and timely scheduling of consultation and diagnostic testing.},

  Abstract                 = {The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) medical records-linkage system was established in 1966 to capture health care information for the entire population of Olmsted County, MN, USA. The REP includes a dynamic cohort of 502 820 unique individuals who resided in Olmsted County at some point between 1966 and 2010, and received health care for any reason at a health care provider within the system. The data available electronically (electronic REP indexes) include demographic characteristics, medical diagnostic codes, surgical procedure codes and death information (including causes of death). In addition, for each resident, the system keeps a complete list of all paper records, electronic records and scanned documents that are available in full text for in-depth review and abstraction. The REP serves as the research infrastructure for studies of virtually all diseases that come to medical attention, and has supported over 2000 peer-reviewed publications since 1966. The system covers residents of all ages and both sexes, regardless of socio-economic status, ethnicity or insurance status. For further information regarding the use of the REP for a specific study, please visit our website at www.rochesterproject.org or contact us at info@rochesterproject.org.

  Abstract                 = {Objectives: To estimate sample sizes available for clinical trials of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children, we described the patient demographics and hospital characteristics associated with children hospitalized with severe TBI in the United States. Methods: We analyzed the 2006 Kids' Inpatient Database. Severe TBI hospitalizations were defined as children discharged with TBI who required mechanical ventilation or intubation. Types of high-volume severe TBI hospitals were categorized based on the numbers of discharged patients with severe TBI in 2006. National estimates of demographics and hospital characteristics were calculated for pediatric severe TBI. Simulation analyses were performed to assess the potential number of severe TBI cases from randomly selected hospitals for inclusion in future clinical trials. Results: The majority of children with severe TBI were discharged from either a children's unit in general hospitals (41%) or a nonchildren's hospital (34%). Less than 5% of all hospitals were high-volume TBI hospitals, which discharged >78% of severe TBI cases and were more likely to be a children's unit in a general hospital or a children's hospital. Simulation analyses indicate that there is a saturation point after which the benefit of adding additional recruitment sites decreases significantly. Conclusions: Children with severe TBI are infrequent at any one hospital in the United States, and few hospitals treat large numbers of children with severe TBI. To effectively plan trials of therapies for severe TBI, much attention has to be paid to selecting the right types of centers to maximize enrollment efficiency.},

Controls showed neither EEG spikes nor electrographic/behavioral seizures. Late seizures were rare after TBI, but EEG spiking was common and may represent a surrogate for PTE.},

  Abstract                 = {Post-traumatic seizures affect 12-35\% of children after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and are associated with worse cognitive and functional outcome, even after adjustment for severity of injury. Unfortunately, experimental models of pediatric post-traumatic epilepsy are lacking, and pathogenesis remains poorly understood. We have applied a standard model of TBI in immature rats to determine the effect of TBI on electroconvulsive seizure thresholds later in life. Male rats underwent controlled cortical impact to left parietal cortex on post-natal day (PND) 16-18. Hindbrain, forebrain, and limbic seizure thresholds were assessed, respectively, by tonic hindlimb extension (THE), minimal clonic, and partial psychomotor seizure responses during adolescence (PND 34-40) and at maturity (PND 60-63). Post-traumatic seizure thresholds were compared to those obtained in age- and litter-matched sham craniotomy and naïve controls. TBI during immaturity had no clear effect on THE seizure thresholds. In contrast, TBI lowered minimal clonic seizure thresholds at maturity (p<0.05 vs. sham or naïve rats), but not during adolescence. Consequently, minimal clonic seizure thresholds increased with age for sham and naïve rats but remained similar for TBI rats during adolescence and at maturity. TBI also tended to lower partial psychomotor seizure thresholds, which were determined only during adolescence (p<0.1 vs. naïve). Controlled cortical impact causes both focal cortical injury at the site of impact and ipsilateral hippocampal neuronal death. Since minimal clonic seizures are mediated by the forebrain, partial psychomotor seizures by the limbic system, and THE seizures by the brainstem, the observed pattern of changes in post-traumatic seizure thresholds is not surprising. The apparent age-dependent effects of TBI, however, are unexpected and likely due to a combination of attenuated maturational increases and progressive epileptogenesis. Additional study is needed to delineate the relative contributions of these processes. Given the sustained reduction in post-traumatic minimal clonic seizure thresholds, controlled cortical impact may hold promise as an experimental model of pediatric post-traumatic epilepsy.},

  Abstract                 = {Clinical decision making often requires estimates of the likelihood of a dichotomous outcome in individual patients. When empirical data are available, these estimates may well be obtained from a logistic regression model. Several strategies may be followed in the development of such a model. In this study, the authors compare alternative strategies in 23 small subsamples from a large data set of patients with an acute myocardial infarction, where they developed predictive models for 30-day mortality. Evaluations were performed in an independent part of the data set. Specifically, the authors studied the effect of coding of covariables and stepwise selection on discriminative ability of the resulting model, and the effect of statistical "shrinkage" techniques on calibration. As expected, dichotomization of continuous covariables implied a loss of information. Remarkably, stepwise selection resulted in less discriminating models compared to full models including all available covariables, even when more than half of these were randomly associated with the outcome. Using qualitative information on the sign of the effect of predictors slightly improved the predictive ability. Calibration improved when shrinkage was applied on the standard maximum likelihood estimates of the regression coefficients. In conclusion, a sensible strategy in small data sets is to apply shrinkage methods in full models that include well-coded predictors that are selected based on external information.},

Several internal validation methods are available that aim to provide a more accurate estimate of model performance in new subjects. We evaluated several variants of split-sample, cross-validation and bootstrapping methods with a logistic regression model that included eight predictors for 30-day mortality after an acute myocardial infarction. Random samples with a size between n = 572 and n = 9165 were drawn from a large data set (GUSTO-I; n = 40,830; 2851 deaths) to reflect modeling in data sets with between 5 and 80 events per variable. Independent performance was determined on the remaining subjects. Performance measures included discriminative ability, calibration and overall accuracy. We found that split-sample analyses gave overly pessimistic estimates of performance, with large variability. Cross-validation on 10\% of the sample had low bias and low variability, but was not suitable for all performance measures. Internal validity could best be estimated with bootstrapping, which provided stable estimates with low bias. We conclude that split-sample validation is inefficient, and recommend bootstrapping for estimation of internal validity of a predictive logistic regression model.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability. A reliable prediction of outcome on admission is of great clinical relevance. We aimed to develop prognostic models with readily available traditional and novel predictors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Prospectively collected individual patient data were analyzed from 11 studies. We considered predictors available at admission in logistic regression models to predict mortality and unfavorable outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 mo after injury. Prognostic models were developed in 8,509 patients with severe or moderate TBI, with cross-validation by omission of each of the 11 studies in turn. External validation was on 6,681 patients from the recent Medical Research Council Corticosteroid Randomisation after Significant Head Injury (MRC CRASH) trial. We found that the strongest predictors of outcome were age, motor score, pupillary reactivity, and CT characteristics, including the presence of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. A prognostic model that combined age, motor score, and pupillary reactivity had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between 0.66 and 0.84 at cross-validation. This performance could be improved (AUC increased by approximately 0.05) by considering CT characteristics, secondary insults (hypotension and hypoxia), and laboratory parameters (glucose and hemoglobin). External validation confirmed that the discriminative ability of the model was adequate (AUC 0.80). Outcomes were systematically worse than predicted, but less so in 1,588 patients who were from high-income countries in the CRASH trial. CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic models using baseline characteristics provide adequate discrimination between patients with good and poor 6 mo outcomes after TBI, especially if CT and laboratory findings are considered in addition to traditional predictors. The model predictions may support clinical practice and research, including the design and analysis of randomized controlled trials.},

  Abstract                 = {The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration.Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision-analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions.We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration, we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n = 544 for model development, n = 273 for external validation).We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The Canadian C-Spine (cervical-spine) Rule (CCR) and the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) Low-Risk Criteria (NLC) are decision rules to guide the use of cervical-spine radiography in patients with trauma. It is unclear how the two decision rules compare in terms of clinical performance. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in nine Canadian emergency departments comparing the CCR and NLC as applied to alert patients with trauma who were in stable condition. The CCR and NLC were interpreted by 394 physicians for patients before radiography. RESULTS: Among the 8283 patients, 169 (2.0 percent) had clinically important cervical-spine injuries. In 845 (10.2 percent) of the patients, physicians did not evaluate range of motion as required by the CCR algorithm. In analyses that excluded these indeterminate cases, the CCR was more sensitive than the NLC (99.4 percent vs. 90.7 percent, P<0.001) and more specific (45.1 percent vs. 36.8 percent, P<0.001) for injury, and its use would have resulted in lower radiography rates (55.9 percent vs. 66.6 percent, P<0.001). In secondary analyses that included all patients, the sensitivity and specificity of CCR, assuming that the indeterminate cases were all positive, were 99.4 percent and 40.4 percent, respectively (P<0.001 for both comparisons with the NLC). Assuming that the CCR was negative for all indeterminate cases, these rates were 95.3 percent (P=0.09 for the comparison with the NLC) and 50.7 percent (P=0.001). The CCR would have missed 1 patient and the NLC would have missed 16 patients with important injuries. CONCLUSIONS: For alert patients with trauma who are in stable condition, the CCR is superior to the NLC with respect to sensitivity and specificity for cervical-spine injury, and its use would result in reduced rates of radiography.},

  Abstract                 = {Prospective validation on a new set of patients is an essential test of a new decision rule. However, many clinical decision rules are not prospectively assessed to determine their accuracy, reliability, clinical sensibility, or potential impact on practice. This validation process is important because many statistically derived rules or guidelines do not perform well when tested in a new population. The methodologic standards for a validation study are similar to those described in the article on phase I for derivation studies in the August 2001 issue of Annals of Emergency Medicine. The goal of phase II is to prospectively assess the accuracy, reliability, and acceptability of the decision rule in a new set of patients with minor head injury. This will determine the clinical utility of the rule and is essential if such a rule is to be widely adopted into clinical practice.},

  Abstract                 = {Head injuries are among the most common types of trauma seen in North American emergency departments, with an estimated 1 million cases seen annually. "Minor" head injury (sometimes known as "mild") is defined by a history of loss of consciousness, amnesia, or disorientation in a patient who is conscious and talking, that is, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 to 15. Although most patients with minor head injury can be discharged without sequelae after a period of observation, in a small proportion, their neurologic condition deteriorates and requires neurosurgical intervention for intracranial hematoma. The objective of the Canadian CT Head Rule Study is to develop an accurate and reliable decision rule for the use of computed tomography (CT) in patients with minor head injury. Such a decision rule would allow physicians to be more selective in their use of CT without compromising care of patients with minor head injury. This paper describes in detail the rationale, objectives, and methodology for Phase I of the study in which the decision rule was derived.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: There is much controversy about the use of computed tomography (CT) for patients with minor head injury. We aimed to develop a highly sensitive clinical decision rule for use of CT in patients with minor head injuries. METHODS: We carried out this prospective cohort study in the emergency departments of ten large Canadian hospitals and included consecutive adults who presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13-15 after head injury. We did standardised clinical assessments before the CT scan. The main outcome measures were need for neurological intervention and clinically important brain injury on CT. FINDINGS: The 3121 patients had the following characteristics: mean age 38.7 years); GCS scores of 13 (3.5%), 14 (16.7%), 15 (79.8%); 8% had clinically important brain injury; and 1% required neurological intervention. We derived a CT head rule which consists of five high-risk factors (failure to reach GCS of 15 within 2 h, suspected open skull fracture, any sign of basal skull fracture, vomiting >2 episodes, or age >65 years) and two additional medium-risk factors (amnesia before impact >30 min and dangerous mechanism of injury). The high-risk factors were 100% sensitive (95% CI 92-100%) for predicting need for neurological intervention, and would require only 32% of patients to undergo CT. The medium-risk factors were 98.4% sensitive (95% CI 96-99%) and 49.6% specific for predicting clinically important brain injury, and would require only 54% of patients to undergo CT. INTERPRETATION: We have developed the Canadian CT Head Rule, a highly sensitive decision rule for use of CT. This rule has the potential to significantly standardise and improve the emergency management of patients with minor head injury.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: High levels of variation and inefficiency exist in current clinical practice regarding use of cervical spine (C-spine) radiography in alert and stable trauma patients. OBJECTIVE: To derive a clinical decision rule that is highly sensitive for detecting acute C-spine injury and will allow emergency department (ED) physicians to be more selective in use of radiography in alert and stable trauma patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study conducted from October 1996 to April 1999, in which physicians evaluated patients for 20 standardized clinical findings prior to radiography. In some cases, a second physician performed independent interobserver assessments. SETTING: Ten EDs in large Canadian community and university hospitals. PATIENTS: Convenience sample of 8924 adults (mean age, 37 years) who presented to the ED with blunt trauma to the head/neck, stable vital signs, and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinically important C-spine injury, evaluated by plain radiography, computed tomography, and a structured follow-up telephone interview. The clinical decision rule was derived using the kappa coefficient, logistic regression analysis, and chi(2) recursive partitioning techniques. RESULTS: Among the study sample, 151 (1.7%) had important C-spine injury. The resultant model and final Canadian C-Spine Rule comprises 3 main questions: (1) is there any high-risk factor present that mandates radiography (ie, age >/=65 years, dangerous mechanism, or paresthesias in extremities)? (2) is there any low-risk factor present that allows safe assessment of range of motion (ie, simple rear-end motor vehicle collision, sitting position in ED, ambulatory at any time since injury, delayed onset of neck pain, or absence of midline C-spine tenderness)? and (3) is the patient able to actively rotate neck 45 degrees to the left and right? By cross-validation, this rule had 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 98%-100%) and 42.5% specificity (95% CI, 40%-44%) for identifying 151 clinically important C-spine injuries. The potential radiography ordering rate would be 58.2%. CONCLUSION: We have derived the Canadian C-Spine Rule, a highly sensitive decision rule for use of C-spine radiography in alert and stable trauma patients. If prospectively validated in other cohorts, this rule has the potential to significantly reduce practice variation and inefficiency in ED use of C-spine radiography.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECT: Minimizing secondary brain injuries after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children is critical to maximizing neurological outcome. Brain tissue oxygenation monitoring (as measured by interstitial partial pressure of O2 [PbO2]) is a new tool that may aid in guiding therapies, yet experience in children is limited. This study aims to describe the authors' experience of PbO2 monitoring after TBI. It was hypothesized that PbO2 thresholds could be established that were associated with favorable neurological outcome, and it was determined whether any relationships between PbO2 and other important clinical variables existed. METHODS: Forty-six children with severe TBI (Glasgow coma scale score </= 8 after resuscitation) who underwent PbO2 and brain temperature monitoring between September 2004 and June 2008 were studied. All patients received standard neurocritical care, and 24 were concurrently enrolled in a trial of therapeutic early hypothermia (n = 12/group). The PbO2 was measured in the uninjured frontal cortex. Hourly recordings and calculated daily means of various variables including PbO2, intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), mean arterial blood pressure, partial pressure of arterial O2, and fraction of inspired O2 were compared using several statistical approaches. Glasgow outcome scale scores were determined at 6 months after injury. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 9.4 years (range 0.1-16.5 years; 13 girls) and 8554 hours of monitoring were analyzed (PbO2 range 0.0-97.2 mm Hg). A PbO2 of 30 mm Hg was associated with the highest sensitivity/specificity for favorable neurological outcome at 6 months after TBI, yet CPP was the only factor that was independently associated with favorable outcome. Surprisingly, instances of preserved PbO2 with altered ICP and CPP were observed in some children with unfavorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of PbO2 demonstrated complex interactions with clinical variables reflecting intracranial dynamics using this protocol. A higher threshold than reported in studies in adults was suggested as a potential therapeutic target, but this threshold was not associated with improved outcomes. Additional studies to assess the utility of PbO2 monitoring after TBI in children are needed.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: There are few investigations evaluating the impact of physician management and leadership skills on patient care. Our objective was to determine whether there were perceived differences in management and leadership performance within a group of intensivists and to correlate these differences with processes of care outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective cohort from January 31 to June 30, 2005. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit in an urban, academic children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Pediatric intensive care unit staff intensivists were the primary participants. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The intensivists' management and leadership performances were assessed by residents and fellows using the Physician Management Index. The primary outcome attributable to the staff was the accomplishment of daily patient goals. A total of 827 resident and fellow assessments of the management and leadership performance of attendings (n = 8) were collected over 2077 patient days (103.4 +/- 39.0 surveys/attending). The mean Physician Management Index was 78.1 +/- 6.2 and differed significantly among the attendings (p < .001). There was excellent agreement by the raters concerning attending performance (intraclass correlation = 0.801). The attendings' Physician Management Indexes were correlated with age (r = 0.594, p < .001) and experience (r = 0.656, p < .001) but not other personal or environmental factors. An average of 3.3 +/- 0.6 goals per patient were written each day, and 86.0% +/- 7.0% were accomplished. Accomplishment of patient goals was correlated with the Physician Management Index (r = 0.306, p < .001) and length of rounds (r = -0.341, p < .001). Other variables, including midnight census, numbers of admissions and discharges, codes, and consultations, did not correlate with the Physician Management Index. CONCLUSIONS: Management and leadership performance of attending intensivists can be measured and is associated with efficiency of care as assessed by accomplishment of daily patient goals. Attendings differ in their management and leadership performances.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Infant mortality in the United States has continued to decline in recent years, but changes in sepsis-associated deaths among infants have not been evaluated previously. METHODS: Data from US death records were analyzed for the period 1979 through 1994 to assess trends in sepsis-associated deaths among newborns and older infants. RESULTS: Annual neonatal mortality associated with sepsis declined by 25% from 50.5 deaths per 100 000 live births in 1979 through 1981 to 38.0 deaths per 100 000 live births in 1992 through 1994. Although infant mortality associated with sepsis declined from 71.7 to 56.4 per 100 000 live births over the same period, this decline was attributable to lower sepsis-related mortality among newborns. The rates of sepsis-associated deaths declined for both preterm and term deliveries. Approximately 2260 infants (1521 of whom were newborns) died of sepsis per year in 1992 through 1994. Sepsis-associated death was more likely to occur among infants who were male, black, preterm, or born in the South. Among black infants, the racial gap in sepsis-associated mortality was greater for term than for preterm infants. CONCLUSIONS: Despite declines in the overall sepsis-related mortality among newborns, racial and regional gaps in mortality persisted over the 16-year study period. Almost half of the sepsis-related deaths occurred among infants who were born prematurely. Disproportionate rates of prematurity among blacks and infants born in the South may have contributed to persistently high sepsis-related mortality in these groups. Future efforts to reduce the incidence of sepsis-associated deaths will depend on targeting higher risk populations and reducing prematurity.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: This study explored whether the increased extracellular relative to intracellular fluid (ECF/ICF) ratio in obesity might reflect osmotic effects of elevated plasma solute concentrations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, epidemiological survey. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: The present analysis used nationally representative data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey on community-dwelling adults (aged 40-59 years) in the US without evidence of glucose dysregulation or chronic disease (n=1285). INTERVENTION: Body mass index (BMI) was estimated from measured height and weight. Total body reactance, an index of body fluid distribution, was determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Plasma tonicity (the cumulative index of osmotically effective plasma solute) was estimated from plasma glucose, sodium and potassium. Sex-specific relative odds of lower reactance (<or=50 Omega/m for women, <or=40 Omega/m for men) and plasma hypertonicity (tonicity >or=295 mmol/l) associated with overweight (25<or=BMI <30) and obesity (BMI>or=30) were estimated using logistic regression models that controlled for sociodemographic variables, smoking, leisure-time physical activity, total energy intake, serum creatinine, plasma insulin and glucose. Multinomial logistic regression models tested for associations between weight status and specific serum solute. RESULTS: Independent of covariates, in men and women, overweight and obesity were associated with increased odds of lower reactance and hypertonicity. Overweight and obese individuals with lower reactance had significantly higher serum sodium than normal weight individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma solute concentrations are associated with obesity in free-living adults. Physicians and researchers should be alert to a possible link between hypertonicity and obesity.

  Abstract                 = {Indices of plasma hypertonicity, elevated plasma concentrations of solutes that draw fluid out of cells by osmosis, are needed to pursue hypertonicity as a possible risk factor for obesity and chronic disease. This paper proposes a new index that may be more sensitive to mild hypertonicity in vivo at a point in time than traditional measures. The index compares mean corpuscular volume (MCV) estimates from diluted (in solution by automated cell counter) and nondiluted blood (calculated from manual hematocrit, MCV=Hct/RBC*10(6)). A larger Auto vs Manual MCV (>2 fl) in vitro indicates hypertonicity in vivo if the cell counter diluent is isotonic with the threshold for plasma vasopressin (PVP) release and PVP is detectable in plasma (>0.5 pg/ml). To evaluate this principle of concept, hypertonicity was induced by 24-h fluid restriction after a 20 ml/kg water load in four healthy men (20-46 years). Unlike serum and urine indices, the MCV difference-&-PVP index detected hypertonicity in all participants.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To test if there was significant variation of mean adjusted duration of respiratory support (RS) at the site level among Australian and New Zealand pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and to determine whether the pattern of variation differed from the site-level pattern of variation in length of stay (LoS). DESIGN: Separate outcome prediction models for estimating PICU LoS and duration of RS were constructed, using patient data collected between 2002 and 2007. Gamma regression was used to model LoS for all admissions included in the study population, and log normal regression was used to model duration of RS for the subset of patients receiving RS. For both models, case-mix adjustment was achieved by entering patient risk factors as fixed effects, and the PICU or site of care was entered as a random effect. SETTING: Data for 31,358 admissions were collected from nine specialist PICUs in Australia and New Zealand. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Average risk-adjusted duration of RS and LoS for each PICU. There was significant unit-level variation in the adjusted mean LoS and duration of RS among PICUs in Australia and New Zealand. One site had a mean duration of RS that was significantly longer than expected, whereas two sites had a mean duration of RS that was significantly shorter than expected at the 95% level. Unit-level variation in duration of RS is consistent with unit-level variation in LoS for six PICUs and significantly different in two units. CONCLUSION: There is unit-level variation in LoS and duration of RS, not accounted for by case-mix. Concurrent analysis of unit-level variation in LoS and duration of RS can help to identify differences in discharge practice and provide direction for improvements in clinical or administrative efficiency.},

METHOD: Retrospective data from Australian and New Zealand institutions that admitted children to ICU were analysed. The data were collected between 1997 and 2006, providing a total of 123 institution years of data (an average of 6.15 years per site). Using 47,068 admissions, LoS was modelled as the outcome variable of a Gamma regression with a child's risk factors entered as fixed effects (allowing adjustment for case mix) and variation among ICUs modelled using a random effect. RESULTS: Six Australasian ICUs had an average risk-adjusted LoS for children, which was significantly shorter than average, whereas five had an average LoS that was significantly longer than average. The remaining nine sites had average LoS that were not significantly different from the average (at the 95% level). Among other risk factors, previous admission to an ICU and respiratory support within the first hour of admission were both associated with prolonged LoS. CONCLUSION: There was significant variation in paediatric LoS at the ICU level not accounted for by patient case-mix. This has important implications for efficiency of ICU processes and, possibly, other components of quality of patient care in those institutions with longer LoS.},

DESIGN: International, multicenter, prospective cohort study. SETTING: Sixty ICUs that accept pediatric admissions in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: All children admitted in 2010 and 2011 younger than 18 years old at the time of admission and either died in ICU or were discharged. Patients who were transferred to another ICU were not included. Fifty-three thousand one hundred twelve patient admissions were included in the analysis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: A revised prediction model was built using logistic regression. Variable selection was based on significance at the 95% level and overall improvement of the model's discriminatory performance and goodness of fit. The final model discriminated well (area under the curve, 0.88, 0.88-0.89); however, the model performed better in Australia and New Zealand than in the United Kingdom and Ireland (area under the curve was 0.91, 0.90-0.93 and 0.85, 0.84-0.86, respectively).

  Abstract                 = {Frailty, a poorly measured confounder in older patients, can promote treatment in some situations and discourage it in others. This can create unmeasured confounding and lead to nonuniform treatment effects over the propensity score (PS). The authors compared bias and mean squared error for various PS implementations under PS trimming, thereby excluding persons treated contrary to prediction. Cohort studies were simulated with a binary treatment T as a function of 8 covariates X. Two of the covariates were assumed to be unmeasured strong risk factors for the outcome and present in persons treated contrary to prediction. The outcome Y was simulated as a Poisson function of T and all X's. In analyses based on measured covariates only, the range of PS's was trimmed asymmetrically according to the percentile of PS in treated patients at the lower end and in untreated patients at the upper end. PS trimming reduced bias due to unmeasured confounders and mean squared error in most scenarios assessed. Treatment effect estimates based on PS range restrictions do not correspond to a causal parameter but may be less biased by such unmeasured confounding. Increasing validity based on PS trimming may be a unique advantage of PS's over conventional outcome models.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: 1) To perform a statewide analysis of the frequency of major pediatric trauma cases and the use of resuscitation skills by paramedics (EMT-Ps). 2) To determine whether EMT-Ps use resuscitation skills less frequently for injured children than for older patients. METHODS: Study Design: Retrospective, database analysis of major trauma cases. Setting and Population: 1995 statewide trauma registry data for patients with EMT-P scene care. OBSERVATIONS: The database included patient demographics, field vital signs, field procedures [e.g., intravenous (i.v.) line placement, chest compressions, needle thoracostomy, endotracheal intubation], field medication, and vital signs at ED presentation. Data Analysis: Patients aged < or = 12 years ("pediatric") were compared with those aged > 12 years ("older"). Analyses of patients with tachycardia, hypotension, and obtundation were performed using chi 2 analysis (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: Of 3,502 trauma patients managed by an EMT-P, only 297 (8%) were aged < or = 12 years. Fewer pediatric patients (18%) than adults (27%) had an injury severity scale score > or = 16, p < 0.005. The frequency of most resuscitation skills and the administration of medications were not statistically different between patient groups. However, i.v.s were four times more likely to be placed in adults (76%) than in pediatric patients (42%), p < 0.001. Subanalyses indicated fewer pediatric patients with tachycardia (p = 0.02) or hypotension (p = 0.02) received an i.v., compared with adults who had similar physiologic parameters. Obtunded patients were equally likely to receive endotracheal intubation, although the procedure was rarely used (20%). CONCLUSIONS: EMT-Ps infrequently manage seriously injured children. i.v.s are less frequently placed in pediatric trauma patients, even in the setting of physiologic abnormalities. The contributions of these field procedures to patient outcomes should be evaluated further.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Prone position ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) improves oxygenation but not survival, except possibly when AHRF is severe. OBJECTIVE: To determine effects of prone versus supine ventilation in AHRF and severe hypoxemia [partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO(2))/inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO(2)) <100 mmHg] compared with moderate hypoxemia (100 mmHg < or = PaO(2)/FiO(2) < or = 300 mmHg). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (to November 2009) and conference proceedings. METHODS: Two authors independently selected and extracted data from parallel-group randomized controlled trials comparing prone with supine ventilation in mechanically ventilated adults or children with AHRF. Trialists provided subgroup data. The primary outcome was hospital mortality in patients with AHRF and PaO(2)/FiO(2) <100 mmHg. Meta-analyses used study-level random-effects models. RESULTS: Ten trials (N = 1,867 patients) met inclusion criteria; most patients had acute lung injury. Methodological quality was relatively high. Prone ventilation reduced mortality in patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) <100 mmHg [risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-0.96; p = 0.01; seven trials, N = 555] but not in patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) > or =100 mmHg (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93-1.22; p = 0.36; seven trials, N = 1,169). Risk ratios differed significantly between subgroups (interaction p = 0.012). Post hoc analysis demonstrated statistically significant improved mortality in the more hypoxemic subgroup and significant differences between subgroups using a range of PaO(2)/FiO(2) thresholds up to approximately 140 mmHg. Prone ventilation improved oxygenation by 27-39% over the first 3 days of therapy but increased the risks of pressure ulcers (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.16-1.44), endotracheal tube obstruction (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.24-2.01), and chest tube dislodgement (RR 3.14, 95% CI 1.02-9.69). There was no statistical between-trial heterogeneity for most clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Prone ventilation reduces mortality in patients with severe hypoxemia. Given associated risks, this approach should not be routine in all patients with AHRF, but may be considered for severely hypoxemic patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Immortal time is a span of cohort follow-up during which, because of exposure definition, the outcome under study could not occur. Bias from immortal time was first identified in the 1970s in epidemiology in the context of cohort studies of the survival benefit of heart transplantation. It recently resurfaced in pharmaco-epidemiology, with several observational studies reporting that various medications can be extremely effective at reducing morbidity and mortality. These studies, while using different cohort designs, all involved some form of immortal time and the corresponding bias. In this paper, the author describes various cohort study designs leading to this bias, quantifies its magnitude under different survival distributions, and illustrates it by using data from a cohort of lung cancer patients. The author shows that for time-based, event-based, and exposure-based cohort definitions, the bias in the rate ratio resulting from misclassified or excluded immortal time increases proportionately to the duration of immortal time. The bias is more pronounced with a decreasing hazard function for the outcome event, as illustrated with the Weibull distribution compared with a constant hazard from the exponential distribution. In conclusion, observational studies of drug benefit in which computerized databases are used must be designed and analyzed properly to avoid immortal time bias.},

METHODS: We measured the consent rates among 64-year-old residents who underwent medical checkups in a city for a cohort study consisting of a questionnaire survey and blood-sample donation and determined the influence of different approaches to informed consent and the participants' characteristics on the consent rates. RESULTS: Of 3,098 residents who underwent medical checkups over 10 years, 99.2% responded to the questionnaire survey, and 92.5% agreed to blood-sample donation. The consent rate for blood-sample donation after obtaining individual written informed consent was lower than that observed with the general-announcement approach. Differences in the consent rates for participation in the questionnaire study were, however, negligible. A higher percentage of men than women consented to donate blood samples. After adjustments for gender, it was observed that individuals with a history of hypertension and those without depression consented to blood-sample donation significantly more frequently. CONCLUSION: The consent rate for blood-sample donation to the study decreased when the opt-in approach with written consent was used. This decrease may introduce consent bias, and the method of obtaining informed consent should be revised.},

Since magnetic resonance imaging provides a means of visualizing neuroanatomic structure in exquisite detail, the scope of this review is to revisit the pathology of traumatic brain injury described in recent clinical imaging studies. Acute imaging provides insight into the acute mechanism of focal and diffuse injury. There is some reduction in threshold for white matter pathology in the hemisphere ipsilateral to injury. After injury, there may be long-term effects on white matter architecture and the potential for brain growth. In this context, the pattern of hippocampal rather than parahippocampal gyrus tissue loss provides insight into the likely cause of white matter injury being cerebral hypoperfusion.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between volume of paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) head injury (HI) admissions, specialist paediatric neurosurgical PICU practice, and mortality in England and Wales. METHODS: Analysis of HI cases (age <16 years) from the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network national cohort of sequential PICU admissions in 27 units in England and Wales, in the 5 years 2004-2008. Risk-adjusted mortality using the Paediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) model was compared between PICUs aggregated into quartile groups, first to fourth based on descending number of HI admissions/year: highest volume, medium-higher volume, medium-lower volume, and lowest volume. The effect of category of PICU interventions - observation only, mechanical ventilation (MV) only, and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring - on outcome was also examined. Observations were reported in relation to specialist paediatric neurosurgical PICU practice. RESULTS: There were 2575 admissions following acute HI (4.4% of non-cardiac surgery PICU admissions in England and Wales). PICU mortality was 9.3%. Units in the fourth-quartile (lowest volume) group did not have significant specialist paediatric neurosurgical activity on the PICU; the other groups did. Overall, there was no effect of HI admissions by individual PICU on risk-adjusted mortality. However, there were significant effects for both intensive care intervention category (p<0.001) and HI admissions by grouping (p<0.005). Funnel plots and control charts using the PIM model showed a hierarchy in increasing performance from lowest volume (group IV), to medium-higher volume (group II), to highest volume (group I), to medium-lower volume (group III) sectors of the health care system. CONCLUSIONS: The health care system in England and Wales for critically ill HI children requiring PICU admission performs as expected in relation to the PIM model. However, the lowest-volume sector, comprising 14 PICUs with little or no paediatric neurosurgical activity on the unit, exhibits worse than expected outcome, particularly in those undergoing ICP monitoring. The best outcomes are seen in units in the mid-volume sector. These data do not support the hypothesis that there is a simple relationship between PICU volume and performance.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the scale of acute neurosurgery for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in childhood, and whether surgical evacuation for haematoma is achieved within four hours of presentation to an emergency department. METHODS: A 12 month audit of emergency access to all specialist neurosurgical and intensive care services in the UK. Severe TBI in a child was defined as that necessitating admission to intensive care. RESULTS: Of 448 children with severe head injuries, 91 (20.3%) underwent emergency neurosurgery, and 37% of these surgical patients had at least one non-reactive and dilated pupil. An acute subdural or epidural haematoma was present in 143/448 (31.9%) children, of whom 66 (46.2%) underwent surgery. Children needing surgical evacuation of haematoma were at a median distance of 29 km (interquartile range (IQR) 11.8-45.7) from their neurosurgical centre. One in four children took longer than one hour to reach hospital after injury. Once in an accident and emergency department, 41% took longer than fours hours to arrive at the regional centre. The median interval between time of accident and arrival at the surgical centre was 4.5 hours (IQR 2.23-7.73), and 79% of inter-hospital transfers were undertaken by the referring hospital rather than the regional centre. In cases where the regional centre undertook the transfer, none were completed within four hours of presentation-the median interval was 6.3 hours (IQR 5.1-8.12). CONCLUSIONS: The system of care for severely head injured children in the UK does not achieve surgical evacuation of a significant haematoma within four hours. The recommendation to use specialist regional paediatric transfer teams delays rather than expedites the emergency service.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECT: The object of our study was to determine, in children with traumatic brain injury and sustained intracranial hypertension, whether very early decompressive craniectomy improves control of intracranial hypertension and longterm function and quality of life. METHODS: All children were managed from admission onward according to a standardized protocol for head injury management. Children with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) were randomized to standardized management alone or standardized management plus cerebral decompression. A decompressive bitemporal craniectomy was performed at a median of 19.2 h (range 7.3-29.3 h) from the time of injury. ICP was recorded hourly via an intraventricular catheter. Compared with the ICP before randomization, the mean ICP was 3.69 mmHg lower in the 48 h after randomization in the control group, and 8.98 mmHg lower in the 48 hours after craniectomy in the decompression group (P=0.057). Outcome was assessed 6 months after injury using a modification of the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) and the Health State Utility Index (Mark 1). Two (14%) of the 14 children in the control group were normal or had a mild disability after 6 months, compared with 7 (54%) of the 13 children in the decompression group. Our conclusion was that when children with traumatic brain injury and sustained intracranial hypertension are treated with a combination of very early decompressive craniectomy and conventional medical management, it is more likely that ICP will be reduced, fewer episodes of intracranial hypertension will occur, and functional outcome and quality of life may be better than in children treated with medical management alone (P=0.046; owing to multiple significance testing P <0.0221 is required for statistical significance). This pilot study suggests that very early decompressive craniectomy may be indicated in the treatment of traumatic brain injury.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To provide new epidemiological evidence base of information on models of hospice care for children and young adults. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of children referred to a hospice. SETTING: Martin House Children's and Young Person's Hospice in Boston Spa, North Yorkshire, UK. PARTICIPANTS: All children who had been referred for care at Martin House Children's Hospice since it opened in August 1987, until May 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic profiles and survival times overall and by diagnostic group classified by the Association of Children's Palliative Care (ACT) Diagnostic Categories, calculated using the Kaplan- Meier and log rank pair-wise methodology. RESULTS: Over a 20-year period, 1554 children aged from birth to 19 years were referred to Martin House, of whom 89.5% (mean age 7.45 years) were accepted. The deprivation profile, referral source and distribution of diagnoses of these children have changed over time with recently increasing numbers of non-progressive disorders (ACT category 4). The ethnicity profile has changed with an increase in the numbers of South Asian children. The overall mean survival time was 5.6 years (95% CI 5.1 to 6.1) but this differed by ACT category. Diagnostic category was significantly associated with differing survival patterns. CONCLUSIONS: There are a disproportionate number of children from areas of higher deprivation being referred for palliative care services. There has been a recent increase in the number of children from South Asian families being referred to palliative care services in Yorkshire. Survival times for children and young people receiving care from a hospice can vary from hours and days to more than 20 years.},

Both responses were dependent on RNA and protein synthesis. Conversely, the foreign pollen and incompatible fungi were sensitive to the pea pod tissue and were subject to abnormal development.The induction of pisatin and the yellow-green fluorescence development were mediated by multiple compounds of varying sizes released by fungi or mouse tumor cells. The incompatibility between a bean pathogen, Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli, and pea pod tissue was hypothesized to occur as a result of the cross contamination of such inducing compounds.},

We hypothesized that application of this using International Classification of Injury Severity Score (ICISS) for individual patient risk stratification to a group of hospitals contributing data to the National Pediatric Trauma Registry (NPTR) would apply objective evidence of actual injuries to define an expected standard and identify performance outliers. METHODS: Using a blinded code, children entered into phase III of the NPTR were aggregated by treating hospital. Individual patient ICISS survival probability (Ps) were calculated using survival risk ratios (SRR) derived from the phase II NPTR dataset (n = 53,253). For each center, sample size, observed mortality, and ICISS Ps were calculated. Probability of mortality (Pm) was computed as 1 - Ps. Logistic regression was used to develop a predictive model for mortality. Logit transformation of Pm was performed to adjust for the skew of minor injury in children and reduce overestimation of low Pm fatalities. Mean Pm was computed for each center and multiplied by its volume to determine expected frequency. Observed to expected ratio (O/E) and 95% confidence interval were calculated to define expected performance and outliers above or below 1 SD of the mean O/E. RESULTS: Patients treated at 30 pediatric trauma centers (mean volume = 451 +/- 258/patients per center) were evaluated. Mean O/E was 1.001 with SD = 0.404. Twenty-two centers fell within the reference range; O/E of 12 centers exceeded 1, suggesting performance below expectation. Trauma center volume, as reflected by sample, did not correlate to O/E performance. CONCLUSIONS: Application of ICISS Ps from a national pediatric benchmark population simplifies determination of expected mortality necessary to compute the expected component of National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Analysis of these ratios of expected to observed mortality demonstrates variance among centers, defines performance against peers using the same benchmarks, and can drive performance improvement based on the objective evidence of injury diagnoses actually encountered.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Expeditious care within minutes of severe injury improves outcome and is the driving force for development of trauma care systems. Transition from hospital care to rehabilitation is an important step in recovery after trauma-related injury. We hypothesize that delay in the transition from acute care to rehabilitation adversely affects outcome and diminishes recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: After institutional review board approval, the trauma registry of our regional level I pediatric trauma center was queried for all children with severe blunt TBI (initial Glasgow Coma Scale score </=8) that required inpatient rehabilitation. Records were stratified as severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] scores 3, 4, 5) and moderate TBI (GSC scores 6, 7, 8). Intensity of acute care was defined by need for mechanical ventilation and length of intensive care unit stay. Outcome was defined by functional independence measurement (FIM) scores at time of transfer to inpatient rehabilitation. Linear regression was used to compare time in days between discharge from intensive care and admission to inpatient rehabilitation (delay) to rehabilitation efficiency (RE), defined as the ratio of FIM score improvement to length of stay for inpatient rehabilitation. Functional improvement was determined by analysis of FIM score improvement (DeltaFIM) between initiation and completion of inpatient rehabilitation. RESULTS: Between January 2000 and December 2006, 60 children (38 males, mean age, 11.2 years; 22 females, mean age, 10.6 years) with blunt TBI and an initial GCS score of 8 or lower required resuscitation, comprehensive critical care, and inpatient rehabilitation. Mean length of stay in the intensive care unit was 11.1 +/- 7.4 days. Fifty-two children required an average of 9.4 +/- 6.8 ventilator days. Delay ranged between 0 and 24 days (mean, 4.1 days) and was significantly correlated with RE and DeltaFIM (correlation coefficient = -0.346, P = .0068). For children with the highest potential for salvage (GCS scores 6, 7, 8), RE correlation increased to -0.457 (P = .011), whereas those with most severe injury (GCS scores 3, 4, 5) demonstrated a weaker correlation that was not significant. For children with most severe injury (GCS scores 3,4,5), the correlation of DeltaFIM was significant (-0.38; P = .035); however, RE was not. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the price of delay of comprehensive rehabilitation, especially for the most vulnerable TBI children with best potential for salvage. The "golden hour," which has become the mantra for continued refinement of systems of emergency and trauma care, must progress without interruption to the "golden day," during which comprehensive critical care seamlessly transitions to timely and aggressive rehabilitation to effect the greatest functional recovery.},

  Abstract                 = {A polymer monolith bearing weak cation-exchange functionality was prepared for the purpose of demonstrating pH-selective extraction and elution in in-line solid-phase extraction-capillary electrophoresis (SPE-CE) utilising a model set of cationic analytes, namely imidazole, lutidine and 3-phenylpropanamine. Optimization of the electrolyte conditions for efficient elution of the adsorbed analytes using a moving pH boundary required that the capillary and monolith be filled with 44 mM sodium acetate at high pH (pH 6) and a low pH electrolyte of 3 mM sodium acetate pH 3 was placed in the electrolyte vials. This combination allowed the adsorbed analytes to be simultaneously eluted and focused into narrow bands, with peak widths of the eluted analytes having a baseline width of 1.2 s immediately after the monolith. Using these optimum elution conditions, the versatility of the SPE-CE approach was demonstrated by removing unwanted adsorbed components after extraction with a wash at a different pH and also by selecting a pH at which only some of the model weak bases were ionised. The analytical performance of the approach was evaluated and the relative standard deviation for peak heights, peak area and migration times were in the ranges of 1.4-5.3, 1.2-3.3 and 0.4-1.2% respectively. Analytes exhibited linear calibrations with r(2) values ranging from 0.996 to 0.999 over two orders of magnitude. Analyte pre-concentration provided excellent sensitivity, and limits of detection for the analyte used in this study were in the range 8.0-30 ng ml(-1), which was an enhancement of 63 when compared to normal hydrodynamic injection occupying 1.3% of the capillary of these bases in water.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to support cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been shown to improve survival in children and adults. We describe outcomes after the use of ECMO to support CPR (E-CPR) in adults using multiinstitutional data from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry. METHODS: Patients greater than 18 years of age using ECMO to support CPR (E-CPR) during 1992 to 2007 were extracted from the ELSO registry and analyzed. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety-seven (11% of 2,633 adult ECMO uses) reports of E-CPR use in 295 patients were analyzed. Median age was 52 years (interquartile range [IQR], 35, 64) and most patients had cardiac disease (n = 221; 75%). Survival to hospital discharge was 27%. Brain death occurred in 61 (28%) of nonsurvivors. In a multivariate logistic regression model, pre-ECMO factors including a diagnosis of acute myocarditis (odds ratio [OR]: 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05 to 0.69) compared with noncardiac diagnoses and use of percutaneous cannulation technique (OR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.87) lowered odds of mortality, whereas a lower pre-ECMO arterial blood partial pressure of oxygen (Pao(2)) less than 70 mm Hg (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.21 to 6.07) compared with a Pao(2)of 149 mm Hg or greater increased odds of mortality. The need for renal replacement therapy during ECMO increased odds of mortality (OR: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.34 to 4.34). CONCLUSIONS: The use of E-CPR was associated with survival in 27% of adults with cardiac arrest facing imminent mortality. Further studies are warranted to evaluate and better define patients who may benefit from E-CPR.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to support cardiorespiratory function during pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We report on outcomes and predictors of in-hospital mortality after ECMO used to support CPR (E-CPR). METHODS AND RESULTS: Outcomes for patients aged <18 years using E-CPR were analyzed with data from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization, and predictors of in-hospital mortality were determined. Of 26,242 ECMO uses reported, 695 (2.6%) were for E-CPR (n=682 patients). Survival to hospital discharge was 38%. In a multivariable model, pre-ECMO factors such as cardiac disease (odds ratio [OR] 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31 to 0.82) and neonatal respiratory disease (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.66), white race (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94), and pre-ECMO arterial blood pH >7.17 (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.84) were associated with decreased odds of mortality. During ECMO, renal dysfunction (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.03), pulmonary hemorrhage (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.50), neurological injury (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.55 to 5.02), CPR during ECMO (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.42 to 6.58), and arterial blood pH <7.2 (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.23 to 4.06) were associated with increased odds of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: ECMO used to support CPR rescued one third of patients in whom death was otherwise certain. Patient diagnosis, absence of severe metabolic acidosis before ECMO support, and uncomplicated ECMO course were associated with improved survival.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The extraction of specific data from electronic medical records (EMR) remains tedious and is often performed manually. Natural language processing (NLP) programs have been developed to identify and extract information within clinical narrative text. We performed a study to assess the validity of an NLP program to accurately identify patients with prostate cancer and to retrieve pertinent pathologic information from their EMR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of a prospectively collected database including patients from the Southern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Region that underwent prostate biopsies during a 2-week period. A NLP program was used to identify patients with prostate biopsies that were positive for prostatic adenocarcinoma from all pathology reports within this period. The application then processed 100 consecutive patients with prostate adenocarcinoma to extract 10 variables from their pathology reports. The extraction and retrieval of information by NLP was then compared to a blinded manual review. RESULTS: A consecutive series of 18,453 pathology reports were evaluated. NLP correctly detected 117 out of 118 patients (99.1 %) with prostatic adenocarcinoma after TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. NLP had a positive predictive value of 99.1 % with a 99.1 % sensitivity and a 99.9 % specificity to correctly identify patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma after biopsy. The overall ability of the NLP application to accurately extract variables from the pathology reports was 97.6 %. CONCLUSIONS: Natural language processing is a reliable and accurate method to identify select patients and to extract relevant data from an existing EMR in order to establish a prospective clinical database.},

  Abstract                 = {The human polycistronic miRNA cluster miR-17-92 is frequently overexpressed in hematopoietic malignancies and cancers. Its transcription is in part controlled by an E2F-regulated host gene promoter. An intronic A/T-rich region directly upstream of the miRNA coding region also contributes to cluster expression. Our deletion analysis of the A/T-rich region revealed a strong dependence on c-Myc binding to the functional E3 site. Yet, constructs lacking the 5'-proximal ~1.3 kb or 3'-distal ~0.1 kb of the 1.5 kb A/T-rich region still retained residual specific promoter activity, suggesting multiple transcription start sites (TSS) in this region. Furthermore, the protooncogenic kinase, Pim-1, its phosphorylation target HP1gamma and c-Myc colocalize to the E3 region, as inferred from chromatin immunoprecipitation. Analysis of pri-miR-17-92 expression levels in K562 and HeLa cells revealed that silencing of E2F3, c-Myc or Pim-1 negatively affects cluster expression, with a synergistic effect caused by c-Myc/Pim-1 double knockdown in HeLa cells. Thus, we show, for the first time, that the protooncogene Pim-1 is part of the network that regulates transcription of the human miR-17-92 cluster.},

My proposal minimizes the log partial likelihood subject to the sum of the absolute values of the parameters being bounded by a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint, it shrinks coefficients and produces some coefficients that are exactly zero. As a result it reduces the estimation variance while providing an interpretable final model. The method is a variation of the 'lasso' proposal of Tibshirani, designed for the linear regression context. Simulations indicate that the lasso can be more accurate than stepwise selection in this setting.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Hospital billing data are frequently used for quality measures and research, but the accuracy of the use of discharge codes to identify urinary tract infections (UTIs) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9) discharge codes to identify children hospitalized with UTIs. METHODS: This multicenter study conducted in 5 children's hospitals included children aged 3 days to 18 years who had been admitted to the hospital, undergone a urinalysis or urine culture, and discharged from the hospital. Data were obtained from the pediatric health information system database and medical record review. With the use of 2 gold-standard methods, the positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated for individual and combined UTI codes and for common UTI identification strategies. PPV was measured for all groupings for which the UTI code was the principal discharge diagnosis. RESULTS: There were 833 patients in the study. The PPV was 50.3% with the use of the gold standard of laboratory-confirmed UTIs but increased to 85% with provider confirmation. Restriction of the study cohort to patients with a principle diagnosis of UTI improved the PPV for laboratory-confirmed UTI (61.2%) and provider-confirmed UTI (93.2%), as well as the ability to benchmark performance. Other common identification strategies did not markedly affect the PPV. CONCLUSIONS: ICD-9 codes can be used to identify patients with UTIs but are most accurate when UTI is the principal discharge diagnosis. The identification strategies reported in this study can be used to improve the accuracy and applicability of benchmarking measures.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: This study examines the incidence, utilization of procedures, and outcomes for critically ill children hospitalized with traumatic brain injury over the period 1988-1999 to describe the benefits of improved treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of hospital discharges was conducted using data from the Health Care Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample that approximates a 20% sample of U.S. acute care hospitals. SETTING: Hospital inpatient stays from all types of U.S. community hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: The study sample included all children aged 0-21 with a primary or secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for traumatic brain injury and a procedure code for either endotracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Deaths occurring during hospitalization were used to calculate mortality rates. Use of intracranial pressure monitoring and surgical openings of the skull were investigated as markers for the aggressiveness of treatment. Patients were further classified by insurance status, household income, and hospital characteristics. Over the 12-yr study period, mortality rates decreased 8 percentage points whereas utilization of intracranial pressure monitoring increased by 11 percentage points. The trend toward more aggressive management of traumatic brain injury corresponded with improved hospital outcomes over time. Lack of insurance was associated with vastly worse outcomes. An estimated 6,437 children survived their traumatic brain injury hospitalization because of improved treatment, and 1,418 children died because of increased mortality risk associated with being uninsured. Improved treatment was valued at approximately dollar 17 billion, whereas acute care hospitalization costs increased by dollar 1.5 billion (in constant 2000 dollars). Increased mortality in uninsured children was associated with a dollar 3.76 billion loss in economic benefits. CONCLUSIONS: More aggressive management of pediatric traumatic brain injury appears to have contributed to reduced mortality rates over time and saved thousands of lives. Additional lives could be saved if mortality rates could be equalized between insured and uninsured children.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Birth defects impose substantial costs on both families and society because of medical, developmental, and special education needs. Caring for children with birth defects also may influence caregiver time and impact the family. However, the economic cost of caregiver time and other impacts on the family has received far less attention than traditional healthcare costs. METHODS: This study reviews the literature on measuring caregiver time costs and family impact in an economic framework. The economic framework involves translating caregiver time or difficulties into appropriate units such as cost or quality adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Despite the potential important contribution of caregiver time costs to the total cost estimate of birth defects, few studies estimate caregiver time costs related specifically to birth defects. Only two studies provide estimates of these costs. Recent work has investigated the impact of chronic illness on caregivers in QALY terms, but birth defects have not been studied. Several issues need to be addressed in both the estimation of caregiver time costs and family impact to improve cost estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Improved estimates of caregiver time costs and impact on the family will assist policy makers in allocating resources for the prevention and treatment of birth defects. Future research should investigate the economic costs of caregiver time and family impact associated with caring for children with birth defects.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) have expanded nationally, yet few studies have examined the potential impact of regionalization and no study has demonstrated whether a relationship between patient volume and outcome exists in these units. Documentation of an inverse relationship between volume and outcome has important implications for regionalization of care. OBJECTIVES: This study examines relationships between the volume of patients and other unit characteristics on patient outcomes in PICUs. Specifically, we investigate whether an increase in patient volume improves mortality risk and reduces length of stay. DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective multicenter cohort design was used with 16 PICUs. All of the units participated in the Pediatric Critical Care Study Group. Participants. Data were collected on 11 106 consecutive admissions to the 16 units over a 12-month period beginning in January 1993. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk-adjusted mortality and length of stay were examined in multivariate analyses. The multivariate models used the Pediatric Risk of Mortality score and other clinical measures as independent variables to risk-adjust for illness severity and case-mix differences. RESULTS: The average patient volume across the 16 PICUs was 863 with a standard deviation of 341. We found significant effects of patient volume on both risk-adjusted mortality and patient length of stay. A 100-patient increase in PICU volume decreased risk-adjusted mortality (adjusted odds ratio:.95; 95% confidence interval:.91-.99), and reduced length of stay (incident rate ratio:.98; 95% confidence interval:.975-.985). Other PICU characteristics, such as fellowship training program, university hospital affiliation, number of PICU beds, and children's hospital affiliation, had no effect on risk-adjusted mortality or patient length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of patients in PICUs is inversely related to risk-adjusted mortality and patient length of stay. A further understanding of this relationship is needed to develop effective regionalization and referral policies for critically ill children.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to examine variation in therapies and outcome for pediatric head trauma patients by patient characteristics and by pediatric intensive care unit. Specifically, the study was designed to examine severity of illness on admission to the pediatric intensive care unit, the therapies used during the pediatric intensive care unit stay, and patient outcomes. DATA SOURCES AND SETTING: Consecutive admissions from three pediatric intensive care units were recorded prospectively (n = 5,749). For this study, all patients with an admitting diagnosis of head trauma were included (n = 477). Data collection occurred during an 18-month period beginning in June 1996. All of the pediatric intensive care units were located in children's hospitals, had residency and fellowship training programs, and were headed by a pediatric intensivist. METHODS: Admission severity was measured as the worst recorded physiological derangement during the period <or=6 hrs before pediatric intensive care unit admission. Therapies and resource use were based on the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System with adaptations for pediatrics. The use of intracranial pressure monitoring was recorded on admission to the unit (within 1 hr) and at any time during the pediatric intensive care unit stay. Outcomes were measured at the time of pediatric intensive care unit discharge by the Pediatric Overall Performance Category scale. Risk factors for mortality were examined by using bivariate analyses with significant predictors as candidate variables in a logistic regression to predict expected mortality. Intracranial pressure monitoring and other therapies were added to the mortality prediction model to test for protective effects. Finally, race and insurance status were added to the model to test for differences in the quality of care. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate for the entire sample was 7.8%. Mortality rates for children <or=1 yr old were significantly higher than for children >1 yr old (16.1% vs. 6.1%; p = .002). Comparisons by insurance status indicated that observed mortality rates were highest for self-paying patients. However, patient characteristics were not associated with use of therapies or standardized mortality rates after adjustment for patient severity. There was significant variation in the use of paralytic agents, seizure medications, induced hypothermia, and intracranial pressure monitoring on admission across the three pediatric intensive care units. In multivariate models, only the use of seizure medications was associated significantly with reduced mortality risk (odds ratio = 0.17; 95% confidence interval = 0.04-0.70; p = .014). CONCLUSIONS: Therapies and outcomes vary across pediatric intensive care units that care for children with head injuries. Increased use of seizure medications may be warranted based on data from this observational study. Large randomized controlled trials of seizure prophylaxis in children with head injury have not been conducted and are needed to confirm the findings presented here.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether heart rate variability metrics provide an accurate method of monitoring depth of anesthesia, assessing the response to painful stimuli, and assessing neuroautonomic regulation of cardiac activity in children receiving propofol anesthesia for short-duration procedures. DESIGN: Prospective, case series. SETTING: Sixteen-bed pediatric intensive care unit, oncology unit, and endoscopy suite in a tertiary care children's hospital and ophthalmology examination rooms in an associated eye institute. PATIENTS: Thirty-three pediatric patients undergoing propofol anesthesia for short procedures. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Heart rate variability metrics studied included mean, SD, low- and high-frequency power, detrended fluctuation analysis (represented by correlation coefficient, alpha), and approximate entropy. Compared with the initial anesthetized state, we found increased heart rate SD (3.17 +/- 1.31 vs. 7.05 +/- 0.26 bpm, p <.0001), heart rate low-frequency power (3.69 +/- 0.36 vs. 4.48 +/- 0.41 bpm(2)/Hz, p <.0001), heart rate low-/high-frequency ratio (1.47 +/- 0.26 vs. 1.26 +/- 0.24, p =.001), and heart rate alpha (1.12 +/- 0.24 vs. 1.35 +/- 0.21, p <.0001) during painful procedure. Mean heart rate (105.8 +/- 13.4 vs. 101.5 +/- 12.4 bpm, p =.005) and heart rate approximate entropy decreased with painful procedure (0.75 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.53 + 0.16, p <.001), whereas there was no significant change in heart rate high-frequency power (3.04 +/- 0.63 vs. 3.16 +/- 0.71 bpm(2)/Hz, p =.26). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that power spectral analysis of heart rate variability may be an accurate and clinically useful measure of depth of propofol anesthesia. We speculate that high-frequency heart rate power during propofol anesthesia correlates with depth of anesthesia, whereas low-frequency power allows for assessment of the patient's sympathetic response to pain.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mechanical ventilation is a common intervention provided by pediatric intensivists. This fact notwithstanding, the management of mechanical ventilation in pediatrics is largely guided by a few pediatric trials along with careful interpretation and application of adult data. RECENT FINDINGS: A low tidal volume, pressure limited approach to mechanical ventilation as established by the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network investigators, has become the prevailing practice in pediatric intensive care. Studies by these investigators suggest that high positive end expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers are not uniformly beneficial. High frequency oscillatory ventilation continues to be evaluated in an attempt to provide 'open lung' ventilation. Airway pressure release ventilation is a newer mode of ventilation that may combine the 'open lung' approach with spontaneous breathing. Prone positioning was demonstrated in a recent pediatric trial to have no effect on outcome, while calfactant was found to potentially improve outcomes in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Ventilator weaning protocols may not be as useful in pediatrics as in adults. Systemic corticosteroids decrease the incidence of post extubation stridor and may reduce reintubation rates. SUMMARY: Mechanical ventilation with pressure limitation and low tidal volumes has become customary in pediatric intensive care units, and this lung protective approach will continue into the foreseeable future. Further investigation is warranted regarding use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation, airway pressure release ventilation, and surfactant to assist pediatric intensivists in application of these therapies.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent studies examined the overall cost of pediatric stroke, but there are little data regarding the sources of these costs. We examined an administrative database that collected charges from 24 US children's hospitals to determine the sources of costs for acute hospital care of stroke. METHODS: We used International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes to search the Pediatric Health Information System. From 2003 to 2009 there were 1667 patients who had a primary diagnosis of stroke, 703 of which were hemorrhagic and 964 were ischemic. Individual costs, excluding physician charges, were gathered under 7 categories that were ranked to determine which contributed the most to total cost. Individual costs were ranked within their categories. We analyzed costs based on stroke type. Total costs were adjusted using the US Consumer Price Index to compare increases with the rate of inflation. RESULTS: Median total cost for any stroke was $19,548 (interquartile range, $10,764-$40,721). The category "other/nursing" contributed the most to hospital costs followed by imaging, laboratory, and pharmacy. Brain MRI and CT contributed the most to imaging costs. Hemorrhagic strokes (median $24,843) were more expensive than ischemic strokes (median $16,954). Total cost increased from 2003 to 2009, but no overall annual trend emerged after controlling for gender, age, race, and hospital. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first in-depth analysis of cost for pediatric stroke care. The highest cost categories are potential targets for cost containment but are also crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment. Necessary yet prudent use of imaging technologies and inpatient stays may be strategies for cost containment.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is frequently diagnosed prenatally, but this has not been shown to improve surgical outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed patients with HLHS between July 1992 and March 1999 to determine the influence of prenatal diagnosis on preoperative clinical status, outcomes of stage 1 surgery, and parental decisions regarding care. Of 88 patients, 33 were diagnosed prenatally and 55 after birth. Of 33 prenatally diagnosed patients, 22 were live-born, and pregnancy was terminated in 11. Of 22 prenatally diagnosed patients who were live-born, 14 underwent surgery, and parents elected to forego treatment in 8. Of 55 patients diagnosed postnatally, 38 underwent surgery, and 17 did not because of parental decisions or clinical considerations. Prenatally diagnosed patients were less likely to undergo surgery than patients diagnosed after birth (P:=0.008). Among live-born infants, there was a similar rate of nonintervention. Among patients who underwent surgery, survival was 75% (39/52). All patients who had a prenatal diagnosis and underwent surgery survived, whereas only 25 of 38 postnatally diagnosed patients survived (P:=0.009). Patients diagnosed prenatally had a lower incidence of preoperative acidosis (P:=0.02), tricuspid regurgitation (P:=0.001), and ventricular dysfunction (P:=0.004). They were also less likely to need preoperative inotropic medications or bicarbonate (P:=0.005). Preoperative factors correlating with early mortality included postnatal diagnosis (P:=0.009), more severe acidosis (P:=0.03), need for bicarbonate or inotropes (P:=0.008 and 0.04), and ventricular dysfunction (P:=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal diagnosis of HLHS was associated with improved preoperative clinical status and with improved survival after first-stage palliation in comparison with patients diagnosed after birth.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The epidemiology and outcomes of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) are incompletely characterized in the pediatric population due to small sample size and conflicting diagnoses of organ failure. We sought to describe the epidemiology and outcomes of early MODS in a large clinical database of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients based on consensus definitions of organ failure.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a contemporaneously collected clinical PICU database.
SETTING: Virtual Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Performance System database patient admissions from January 2004 to December 2005 for 35 U.S. children's hospitals.
PATIENTS: : We evaluated 63,285 consecutive PICU admissions from January 2004 to December 2005 in the Virtual Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Performance System database. We excluded patients younger than 1 month or older than 18 years of age, and hospitals with >10% missing values for MODS variables. We identified day 1 MODS by International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference criteria with day 1 laboratory and vital sign values. We evaluated functional status using Pediatric Overall Performance Category and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scores from PICU admission and discharge.
INTERVENTIONS: Analysis: Student's t test, chi-square test, Mann-Whitney rank sum, Kruskal-Wallis, and linear and logistic regression.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We analyzed 44,693 admissions from 28 hospitals meeting inclusion criteria. Overall PICU mortality was 2.8%. We identified day 1 MODS in 18.6% of admissions. Patients with day 1 MODS had higher mortality (10.0% vs. 1.2%, p < .001), longer PICU length of stay (3.6 vs. 1.3 days, p < .001), and larger change from baseline Pediatric Overall Performance Category and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scores at time of PICU discharge (p < .001). Infants had the highest incidence of day 1 MODS (25.2% vs. 16.5%, p < .001) compared with other age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the largest clinical dataset to date and consensus definitions for organ failure, we found that children with MODS present on day 1 of intensive care unit admission have worse functional outcomes, higher mortality, and longer PICU length of stay than children who do not have MODS on day 1. Infants are disproportionally affected by MODS.},

STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated consecutive PICU admissions from 35 US children's hospitals from January 2004-December 2005 in the virtual PICU Performance System database. We excluded hospitals with >10% missing values for MODS variables and patients<1 month or>18 years of age. MODS was identified by laboratory and vital sign values from day of admission with International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference criteria. Chronic illness was identified by secondary diagnoses, classified by modified Delphi method. We evaluated functional outcomes with pediatric overall performance category and pediatric cerebral performance category scores from PICU admission and discharge.
RESULTS: Of 44 693 admissions, 52.1% had a chronic diagnosis. Chronic diagnoses increased MODS at PICU admission (24.6% vs 12.0%, P<.001) and mortality rates (3.7% vs 1.9%, P<.001). Patients with a chronic diagnosis had similar changes in pediatric overall performance category and pediatric cerebral performance category scores from PICU admission to discharge as previously healthy children. However, outcome in different chronic diagnosis categories was variable.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic illness increased MODS incidence at PICU admission and impacted all-cause PICU mortality rates. Although, in aggregate, children who survive return to baseline functional status, this varies by chronic illness category. Copyright (c) 2010 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays important roles in tumor development. Especially in the early-stage colorectal tumors, COX-2 expression is often observed in the tumor stroma. However, the mechanism regulating such stromal expression of COX-2 remains unknown. In the present study, we simulated the indirect interaction between epithelial cells and stromal cells in the process of colorectal tumor development using an in vitro co-culture model in which NIH3T3 fibroblasts were co-cultured with 'sparsely' or 'densely' populated intestinal epithelial cells, Intestine-407 as a model of premalignant or benign intestinal epithelial cells, and DLD-1 and Caco-2 as models of malignant epithelial cells. COX-2 expression in NIH3T3 fibroblasts was upregulated when co-cultured with the 'dense' epithelial cells regardless of their character. Interestingly, there was pericellular hypoxia in the vicinity of NIH3T3 fibroblasts when co-cultured with 'dense' epithelial cells, and the recovery of the partial pressure of oxygen level resulted in the reduction of enhanced COX-2 expression only in NIH3T3 fibroblasts co-cultured with 'dense' Intestine-407 cells. Furthermore, COX-2 expression was also reduced by the inhibition of transcription factor AP-1. Thus, pericellular hypoxia of the stromal cells caused by densely populated epithelial cells may be one of the potent COX-2 enhancers before completion of malignant transformation during intestinal tumor development.},

  Abstract                 = {Kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) has been qualified by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency as a highly sensitive and specific urinary biomarker to monitor drug-induced kidney injury in preclinical studies and on a case-by-case basis in clinical trials. Here we report the development and evaluation of a rapid direct immunochromatographic lateral flow 15-min assay for detection of urinary Kim-1 (rat) or KIM-1 (human). The urinary Kim-1 band intensity using the rat Kim-1 dipstick significantly correlated with levels of Kim-1 as measured by a microbead-based assay, histopathological damage, and immunohistochemical assessment of renal Kim-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Kim-1 was detected following kidney injury induced in rats by cadmium, gentamicin, or bilateral renal ischemia/reperfusion. In humans, the urinary KIM-1 band intensity was significantly greater in urine from patients with acute kidney injury than in urine from healthy volunteers. The KIM-1 dipstick also enabled temporal evaluation of kidney injury and recovery in two patients who developed postoperative acute kidney injury following cytoreductive surgery for malignant mesothelioma with intraoperative local cisplatin administration. We hope that future, more extensive studies will confirm the utility of these results, which show that the Kim-1/KIM-1 dipsticks can provide a sensitive and accurate detection of Kim-1/KIM-1, thereby providing a rapid diagnostic assay for kidney damage and facilitating the rapid and early detection of kidney injury in preclinical and clinical studies.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: This article explores parental caregiver perspectives on barriers to asthma care in the Medicaid system. METHODS: Focus groups were held for parents of children with persistent asthma to identify barriers to asthma care for children insured by Medicaid in the Ypsilanti, MI area. Semistructured questions regarding health goals, asthma care, and access were used. Themes were defined as distinct categories or concepts regarding aspects of asthma care and coded. RESULTS: Thirty-six adults participated in four focus groups, 89% were the biological mother, and 64% were African American. Major themes identified included caregiver emotions, caregiver/patient knowledge, environmental issues, school/daycare support, Medicaid health-care system issues, the role of medical providers, and emerging adolescence. Parents demonstrated asthma awareness but were not confident in their role as the child's disease manager. A specific gap was seen in the caregiver's level of self-efficacy to control exposure to asthma triggers, monitor the child's symptoms, and modify medications based on asthma symptoms. CONCLUSION: Medicaid-insured families face unique barriers related to income and insurance limitations as well as issues common to others with asthma. Caregivers demonstrated a high level of asthma knowledge, but like other caregivers gaps between knowledge and behavior existed. Barriers to asthma care that may be specific to Medicaid-insured patients included difficulty maintaining continuity of care due to physician participation in Medicaid programs, and concerns about possible differences in asthma care from health-care providers due to their Medicaid insurance status.},

Intracranial pressure monitoring (ICPM) and craniotomy/craniectomy (CRANI) may affect outcomes. Sources of variability in the use of these interventions remain incompletely understood.To analyze sources of variability in the use of ICPM and CRANI.Retrospective cross-sectional study of patients with moderate/severe pediatric TBI with the use of data submitted to the American College of Surgeons National Trauma Databank.We analyzed data from 7140 children at 156 US hospitals during 7 continuous years. Of the children, 27.4\% had ICPM, whereas 11.7\% had a CRANI. Infants had lower rates of ICPM and CRANI than older children. A lower rate of ICPM was observed among children hospitalized at combined pediatric/adult trauma centers than among children treated at adult-only trauma centers (relative risk = 0.80; 95\% confidence interval 0.66-0.97). For ICPM and CRANI, 18.5\% and 11.6\%, respectively, of residual model variance was explained by between-hospital variation in care delivery, but almost no correlation was observed between within-hospital tendency toward performing these procedures.Infants received less ICPM than older children, and children hospitalized at pediatric trauma centers received less ICPM than children at adult-only trauma centers. In addition, significant between-hospital variability existed in the delivery of ICPM and CRANI to children with moderate-severe TBI.},

At least 4 years after PICU admission, these children showed impairments on several domains of neuropsychological functioning. In the present study, type, number, and dose of sedatives and analgesics were retrospectively evaluated.Tertiary care university hospital.Seventy-seven meningococcal septic shock survivors (median age, 2.1 yr).None.Forty-five patients (58\%) received one or more analgesic and/or sedative drugs during PICU admission, most commonly benzodiazepines (n = 39; 51\%), followed by opioids (n = 23; 30\%). In total, 12 different kinds of analgesic or sedative drugs were given. The use and dose of opioids were significantly associated with poor test outcome on full-scale intelligence quotient (p = 0.02; Z = -2.28), verbal intelligence quotient (p = 0.02; Z = -2.32), verbal intelligence quotient subtests (verbal comprehension [p = 0.01; Z = -2.56] and vocabulary [p = 0.01; Z = -2.45]), and visual attention/executive functioning (Trial Making Test part B) (p = 0.03; Z = -2.17). In multivariate analysis adjusting for patient and disease characteristics, the use of opioids remained significant on most neuropsychological tests.The use of opioids during PICU admission was significantly associated with long-term adverse neuropsychological outcome independent of severity of illness scores in meningococcal septic shock survivors.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between systolic blood pressure and outcome in children after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is unclear. We examined the relationship between age-appropriate systolic blood pressure (AASBP) percentile and outcome after severe pediatric TBI. METHODS: We examined the association between AASBP percentiles and outcome in 172 children younger than 14 years of age with a Glasgow Coma Scale score < 9. Outcome was evaluated using discharge Glasgow Outcome Scale score. Poor outcome was defined as a Glasgow Outcome Scale score < 4. RESULTS: Poor outcome was associated with AASBP < 75th percentile (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-8.3). Patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or = 90 mm Hg and AASBP < 75th percentile had a higher odds for poor outcome compared with patients with SBP > or = 90 mm Hg and AASBP > or = 75th percentile (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-7.3). CONCLUSION AASBP < 75th percentile was associated with poor outcome after severe pediatric TBI, even when SBP was > or = 90 mm Hg.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Outcomes after pediatric TBI are related to pre-treatment factors including age, injury severity and mechanism of injury and may be positively affected by treatment at trauma centers relative to non-trauma centers. This study estimated the proportion of children with moderate to severe TBI who receive care at trauma centers, and examined factors associated with receipt of care at adult (ATC), pediatric (PTC) and adult/pediatric trauma centers (APTC) compared with care at to non-trauma centers (NTC) using a nationally representative database. Methods: The Kids' Inpatient Database was used to identify hospitalizations for moderate to severe pediatric TBI. Pediatric inpatients aged 0 to 17 years, at least one diagnosis of TBI and a maximum head AIS of >/= 3 were studied. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine factors predictive of the level and type of facility where care was received. Results: 16.7% of patients were hospitalized at NTC, 44.2% at Level I or II ATC, 17.9% at Level I or II PTC, and 21.2% at Level I or II APTC. Multiple regression analyses showed receipt of care at a trauma center was associated with age and polytrauma. Conclusions: Almost 84% of children with moderate to severe TBI currently receive care at a Level I or Level II trauma center. Children with trauma to multiple body regions in addition to more severe TBI are more likely to receive care a trauma center relative to a NTC.},

This new registry, "The Joint Congenital Cardiac Anesthesia Society-Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Cardiac Anesthesia Database," is part of the Congenital Cardiac Anesthesia Society's commitment to patient care and research on outcomes improvement. This report will review the planning and funding of the initial start-up as well as the data elements being used in the registry. Patients in the registry include not only cardiac surgical patients but also those with congenital heart disease undergoing procedures in locations other than the operating room, including in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, intensive care unit, general operating room, and radiology suite. Initial results from the first data harvests are reported, including site participation, patient population submitted, and adverse outcomes observed. These initial results validate the concept and serve as a benchmark for further development and implementation of the registry. Because of the relative infrequency of anesthesia-related events in this low-volume procedure, a multisite data harvest is the most reasonable approach to capture a sufficient number of patient encounters in a timely manner to support outcomes analysis, quality assessment, and quality improvement.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Medical problems may affect the ability to drive motor vehicles, and programs that control the issuing of driver licenses to individuals with medical conditions exist in most states. The main activity of these programs is the imposition of restrictions upon the driving privileges of individuals with medical conditions that are deemed to pose some risk to public safety. However, little is known about the effectiveness of these licensing programs. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the rates of adverse driving events (crash, at-fault crash and citations) experienced by drivers licensed with medical conditions to those of age-, sex- and location-matched controls. Separate comparisons were made for drivers reporting medical conditions licensed with full driving privileges, and those with restricted driving privileges (e.g. speed, area and time of day). DESIGN: Retrospective case-control. METHODS: The study population was all drivers licensed in the state of Utah who reported a medical condition on their driver license application, over the 5-year period 1992-1996. Drivers enter the program by self-reporting their medical problems. Control drivers were chosen from the entire population of drivers licensed in Utah for the same period. Information on driver license status, participation in the medical conditions program, citations, involvement in crashes, and death certificate data was obtained from the relevant state agencies. Probabilistic linkage methodology was used to link the records in these disparate databases for eventual analysis. Rates of citation, crashes and at-fault crashes, expressed as events per 10000 license days, were calculated separately for program drivers and their corresponding control groups for each medical condition category and restriction status. These data were used to determine an estimate of relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals. Results: As a group, medical conditions drivers had modestly elevated rates of adverse driving events compared with control drivers (RR 1.09-1.74). Rates in the largest medical category, 'cardiovascular conditions', were not higher than controls. Rates were higher than control for some conditions, such as 'alcohol' and 'learning and memory', for some adverse events (RR 2.2 -5.75). Drivers with more than one medical condition appeared comparable to the general group of medical conditions program drivers. CONCLUSIONS: Drivers in Utah medical conditions program had modestly elevated rates of adverse driving events compared to matched controls. Possible underreporting of medical conditions and accurate assessment of exposure rates are potential weaknesses in the program.},

Ten patients had seizures and were compared with a matched cohort of traumatic brain injury patients without seizures. The seizures were repetitive and constituted status epilepticus in seven of ten patients. Using a within-subject design, post-traumatic seizures resulted in episodic increases in intracranial pressure (22.4 +/- 7 vs. 12.8 +/- 4.3 mm Hg; p < .001) and an episodic increase in lactate/pyruvate ratio (49.4 +/- 16 vs. 23.8 +/- 7.6; p < .001) in the seizure group. Using a between-subjects comparison, the seizure group demonstrated a higher mean intracranial pressure (17.6 +/- 6.5 vs. 12.2 +/- 4.2 mm Hg; p < .001), a higher mean lactate/pyruvate ratio (38.6 +/- 18 vs. 27 +/- 9; p < .001) compared with nonseizure patients. The intracranial pressure and lactate/pyruvate ratio remained elevated beyond postinjury hour 100 in the seizure group but not the nonseizure group (p < .02).Post-traumatic seizures result in episodic as well as long-lasting increases in intracranial pressure and microdialysis lactate/pyruvate ratio. These data suggest that post-traumatic seizures represent a therapeutic target for patients with traumatic brain injury.},

  Abstract                 = {The early pathophysiological features of traumatic brain injury observed in the intensive care unit (ICU) have been described in terms of altered cerebral blood flow, altered brain metabolism, and neurochemical excitotoxicity. Seizures occur in animal models of brain injury and in human brain injury. Previous studies of posttraumatic seizures in humans have been based principally on clinical observations without a systematic approach to electroencephalographic (EEG) recording of seizures. The purpose of this study was to determine prospectively the incidence of convulsive and nonconvulsive seizures by using continuous EEG monitoring in patients in the ICU during the initial 14 days post-injury.Ninety-four patients with moderate-to-severe brain injuries underwent continuous EEG monitoring begin-ning at admission to the ICU (mean delay 9.6+/-5.4 hours) and extending up to 14 days postinjury. Convulsive and nonconvulsive seizures occurred in 21 (22\%) of the 94 patients, with six of them displaying status epilepticus. In more than half of the patients (52\%) the seizures were nonconvulsive and were diagnosed on the basis of EEG studies alone. All six patients with status epilepticus died, compared with a mortality rate of 24\% (18 of 73) in the nonseizure group (p<0.001). The patients with status epilepticus had a shorter mean length of stay (9.14+/-5.9 days compared with 14+/-9 days [t-test, p<0.031). Seizures occurred despite initiation of prophylactic phenytoin on admission to the emergency room, with maintenance at mean levels of 16.6+/-2.8 mg/dl. No differences in key prognostic factors (such as the Glasgow Coma Scale score, early hypoxemia, early hypotension, or 1-month Glasgow Outcome Scale score) were found between the patients with seizures and those without.Seizures occur in more than one in five patients during the 1st week after moderate-to-severe brain injury and may play a role in the pathobiological conditions associated with brain injury.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Pediatric victims of blunt trauma have developmental and anatomic characteristics that can make it difficult to assess their risk of cervical spine injury (CSI). Previous reports, all retrospective in nature, have not identified any cases of CSI in either children or adults in the absence of neck pain, neurologic symptoms, distracting injury, or altered mental status. The objective of this study was to examine the incidence and spectrum of spine injury in patients who are younger than 18 years and to evaluate the efficacy of the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) decision instrument for obtaining cervical spine radiography in pediatric trauma victims. METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate pediatric blunt trauma victims. All patients who presented to participating emergency departments underwent clinical evaluation before radiographic imaging. The presence or absence of the following criteria was noted: midline cervical tenderness, altered level of alertness, evidence of intoxication, neurologic abnormality, and presence of painful distracting injury. Presence or absence of each individual criterion was documented for each patient before radiographic imaging, unless the patient was judged to be too unstable to complete the clinical evaluation before radiographs. The decision to radiograph a patient was entirely at the physician's discretion and not driven by the NEXUS questionnaire. The presence or absence of CSI was based on the final interpretation of all radiographic studies. Data on all patients who were younger than 18 years were sequestered from the main database for separate analysis. RESULTS: There were 3065 patients (9.0% of all NEXUS patients) who were younger than 18 years in this cohort, 30 of whom (0.98%) sustained a CSI. Included in the study were 88 children who were younger than 2, 817 who were between 2 and 8, and 2160 who were 8 to 17. Fractures of the lower cervical vertebrae (C5-C7) accounted for 45.9% of pediatric CSIs. No case of spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality was reported in any child in this study, although 22 cases were reported in adults. Only 4 of the 30 injured children were younger than 9 years, and none was younger than 2 years. Tenderness and distracting injury were the 2 most common abnormalities noted in patients with and without CSI. The decision rule correctly identified all pediatric CSI victims (sensitivity: 100.0%; 95% confidence interval: 87.8%-100.0%) and correctly designated 603 patients as low risk for CSI (negative predictive value: 100.0%; 95% confidence interval: 99.4%-100.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The lower cervical spine is the most common site of CSI in children, and fractures are the most common type of injury. CSI is rare among patients aged 8 years or younger. The NEXUS decision instrument performed well in children, and its use could reduce pediatric cervical spine imaging by nearly 20%. However, the small number of infants and toddlers in the study suggests caution in applying the NEXUS criteria to this particular age group.},

DESIGN: A 1-day point-prevalence study. SETTING: Intensive care units in 17 countries in Western Europe, excluding coronary care units and pediatric and special care infant units. PATIENTS: All patients (> 10 years of age) occupying an ICU bed over a 24-hour period. A total of 1417 ICUs provided 10 038 patient case reports. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of ICU-acquired infection, prescription of antimicrobials, resistance patterns of microbiological isolates, and potential risk factors for ICU-acquired infection and death. RESULTS: A total of 4501 patients (44.8%) were infected, and 2064 (20.6%) had ICU-acquired infection. Pneumonia (46.9%), lower respiratory tract infection (17.8%), urinary tract infection (17.6%), and bloodstream infection (12%) were the most frequent types of ICU infection reported. Most frequently reported micro-organisms were Enterobacteriaceae (34.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (30.1%;[60% resistant to methicillin], Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28.7%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (19.1%), and fungi (17.1%). Seven risk factors for ICU-acquired infection were identified: increasing length of ICU stay (> 48 hours), mechanical ventilation, diagnosis of trauma, central venous, pulmonary artery, and urinary catheterization, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. ICU-acquired pneumonia (odds ratio [OR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval[Cl], 1.6 to 2.29), clinical sepsis (OR, 3.50; 95% Cl, 1.71 to 7.18), and bloodstream infection (OR, 1.73; 95% Cl, 1.25 to 2.41) increased the risk of ICU death. CONCLUSIONS: ICU-acquired infection is common and often associated with microbiological isolates of resistant organisms. The potential effects on outcome emphasize the importance of specific measures for infection control in critically ill patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Head injury is a major cause of morbidity and death in infants, and child abuse is among its chief causes. Retinal hemorrhages (RHs) are of paramount importance for the diagnosis of child abuse; however, their sensitivity and specificity are poorly estimated. Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common feature; however, its incidence and causative factors are poorly documented.To study the epidemiology of head injuries in infants, factors predisposing to SDH, value of RH for the diagnosis of child abuse, and prognostic factors, the authors prospectively collected data from cases of head injury in infants who were hospitalized at their institution over a 3-year period. One hundred fifty cases were collected, 57 of which were due to child abuse. This prospective study allows the comparison of clinical, radiological, and ophthalmological features in accidental and nonaccidental trauma in infants.Subdural hematomas were significantly correlated with RH and with child abuse but not with idiopathic macrocranium. The sensitivity and specificity of RH for the diagnosis of child abuse were 75 and 93.2\%, respectively. Retinal hemorrhages associated with accidental trauma were always mild, and the specificity of more severe RH for the diagnosis of child abuse was 100\%. The grading of RH requires the expertise of a trained neuroophthalmologist. Child abuse was also significantly associated with antecedents of perinatal illness, absence of signs of impact, and seizures on presentation. Although child abuse represented just 38\% of traumas, it was the cause of 71\% of deaths and 90\% of severe disability in this series. Abuse and the clinical severity on presentation were two significant and independent factors conditioning outcome.},

DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING: Three intensive care units in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty critically ill patients without sepsis who received a single dose of etomidate for facilitating endotracheal intubation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serial serum cortisol and 11beta-deoxycortisol samples were taken at baseline and 60 min after corticotropin stimulation test (250 microg 1-24 ACTH) at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after etomidate administration. Etomidate-related adrenal inhibition was defined by the combination of a rise in cortisol less than 250 nmol/l (9 microg/dl) after ACTH stimulation and an excessive accumulation of serum 11beta-deoxycortisol concentrations at baseline. At 12 h after etomidate administration, 32/40 (80%) patients fulfilled the diagnosis criteria for etomidate-related adrenal insufficiency. This incidence was significantly lower at 48 h (9%) and 72 h (7%). The cortisol to 11beta-deoxycortisol ratio (F/S ratio), reflecting the intensity of the 11beta-hydroxylase enzyme blockade, improved significantly over time. CONCLUSIONS: A single bolus infusion of etomidate resulted in wide adrenal inhibition in critically ill patients. However, this alteration was reversible by 48 h following the drug administration. The empirical use of steroid supplementation for 48 h following a single dose of etomidate in ICU patients without septic shock should thus be considered. Concomitant serum cortisol and 11beta-deoxycortisol dosages are needed to provide evidence for adrenal insufficiency induced by etomidate in critically ill patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies showed that methylprednisolone (MePDN) down-regulates the surface expression of activating NK receptors and sharply inhibits the NK cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Since MePDN is administered to patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplant to treat acute graft versus host disease (GvHD), we analyzed whether it could also inhibit the NK cell differentiation from CD34(+) hemopoietic cell precursors, thus interfering with the development of effector cells with anti-leukemic potential. We show that MePDN promotes the in vitro differentiation of CD161+CD56+/- immature NK cells by inducing a rapid expression of NKp46, NKG2D, DNAX-accessory molecule 1 (DNAM-1), leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 and NKG2A and an efficient cytolytic activity. This phenotypic and functional NK cell maturation occurred more rapidly than in parallel control cultures performed in the absence of MePDN. In addition, MePDN induced CD33+CD161-CD56- myeloid precursors to switch toward NK cells. It is also of note that immature NK cells when cultured in the absence (but not in the presence) of MePDN produced high amounts of IL-8. These data indicate that MePDN can accelerate the in vitro NK cell differentiation, thus revealing a dichotomous effect on immature versus mature NK cells; in addition, interference with the in vitro development of myeloid cells occurred. These effects should be further investigated in hemopoietic stem cell transplanted patients receiving steroids to treat GvHD.},

METHODS: The Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) and the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) were used to investigate the etiology of pediatric SCI. RESULTS: Significant differences in the annual incidence rate of pediatric SCI were found to exist between patient populations stratified by race and sex. African Americans (1.53 cases/100,000 children) exhibit a significantly higher rate of pediatric SCI than native Americans (1.00), Hispanics (0.87), and Asians (0.36), whereas Asians show a significantly lower incidence than all other races. Also, boys (2.79) are more than twice as likely to experience SCI as girls (1.15). The overall incidence of pediatric SCI in the United States is 1.99 cases per 100,000 children. From these data, it is estimated that 1455 children are admitted to US hospitals each year for treatment of SCI. The etiology of pediatric SCI was also investigated, and the major causative factors were identified: motor vehicle accident (56%), accidental fall (14%), firearm injury (9%), and sports injury (7%). Of those children injured in a motor vehicle accident, 67.7% (n = 107) were reported as not wearing a seatbelt. The role of alcohol and drugs was also investigated and found to be involved in 30% (n = 82) of all pediatric SCI cases. CONCLUSIONS: Using discharge records from a public database, it is possible to identify high-risk demographic groups and activities that predispose a child to SCI. With a more thorough understanding of the etiology of pediatric SCI, clinicians and parents are better equipped to devise measures for prevention and treatment of this injury.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Spinal cord monitoring is now considered standard care during surgery for spinal deformity. Combined somatosensory and motor evoked potential monitoring allows the detection of early spinal cord dysfunction in most patients. The purpose of the current study was to identify clinical factors that increase the risk of intraoperative electrophysical changes and to provide management recommendations. METHODS: The records of 162 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for the treatment of spinal deformity at a tertiary referral center were reviewed. Electrophysical monitoring of these patients was considered to have been successful if reproducible signals had been obtained. Relevant electrophysical changes included a reduction, as compared with baseline, of >50% in the amplitude of the somatosensory evoked potentials; an increase, as compared with baseline, of >10% in the latency of the somatosensory evoked potentials; a loss of motor evoked potentials; and an abrupt decrease of >75% in the motor evoked potentials. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-one (93%) of the 162 patients were monitored successfully. Four of the eleven patients with unsuccessful monitoring had neuromuscular scoliosis. Twelve of the 151 successfully monitored patients had a true electrophysical event, and two of them were found to have new postoperative neurologic deficits that represented a change from the findings of their preoperative neurologic examination. The determined causes of these electrophysical events included curve correction in eight patients, hypotension in two, direct cord trauma in one, and malposition of a pedicle screw in one. The patients with a true electrophysical event had a significantly higher rate of neurologic events than did the patients who did not have a true electrophysical event (p < 0.001). The rate of true electrophysical events was significantly higher in the patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities than it was in the patients with no comorbidities (p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Combined somatosensory and motor evoked potential monitoring effectively prevents neurologic injury in most children undergoing surgery for spinal deformity. Despite the potential for false-positive results, we recommend setting a low threshold for defining relevant electrophysical changes. Rapid intervention can reverse these changes and avoid potentially serious neurologic complications. Patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities may be at a higher risk for having relevant electrophysical events.},

  Abstract                 = {AIMS: To evaluate the utility of intrathoracic impedance monitoring for detecting heart failure (HF) deterioration in patients with an implanted cardiac resynchronization/defibrillation device. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients enrolled in the European InSync Sentry Observational Study were audibly alerted by a device algorithm if a decrease in intrathoracic impedance suggested fluid accumulation. Clinical HF status and device data were assessed at enrolment, during regular follow-up, and if patients presented with an alert or HF deterioration. Data from 373 subjects were analysed. Fifty-three alert events and a total of 53 clinical events (HF deterioration defined by worsening of HF signs and symptoms) were reported during a median of 4.2 months. Adjusted for multiple events per patient, the alert detected clinical HF deterioration with 60% sensitivity (95% CI 46-73) and with a positive predictive value of 60% (95% CI 46-73). Higher NYHA class at baseline was predictive for adequate alert events during follow-up (P < 0.05). In 11 of 20 HF deteriorations without preceding alert, an upstroke of the fluid index occurred without reaching the programmed alert threshold. CONCLUSION: A device-based algorithm that alerts patients in case of decreasing intrathoracic impedance facilitates the detection of HF deterioration. Future randomized, controlled trials are needed to test whether the tailored use of intrathoracic impedance monitoring can improve the ambulatory management of patients with chronic HF and an implanted device.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Interhospital critical care transfers are common, yet few studies address the underlying reasons for transfers. We examined clinician and patient/surrogate perceptions about interhospital transfers and assessed their agreement on these transfers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a mixed-mode survey of 3 major stakeholders in interhospital transfers to an academic medical intensive care unit from August 2007 to April 2008. RESULTS: Sixty-two hospitals transferred 138 patients during the study period. Response rates varied among stakeholders (accepting physician, 90%; referring physicians, 20%; patients/surrogates, 33%). All 3 groups frequently endorsed quality of care and need for a specific test/procedure as important. Referring hospital reputation and quality were rarely endorsed. Accepting physicians and patients/surrogates substantially agreed on the need for a specific test (kappa = 0.70) and increased survival (kappa = 0.78) but, otherwise, had fair to poor agreement. Referring physicians and patients/surrogates rarely agreed and sometimes disagreed greater than expected by chance (kappa < 0). Physician pairs strongly agreed on the importance of accepting hospital experience (kappa = 0.96) but agreed less on patient satisfaction at the referring hospital (kappa = 0.37) and referring hospital reputation (kappa = 0.35). CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders do not always agree on the reasons for critical care transfers. Efforts to improve communication are warranted to ensure informed patient choices.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized individuals. METHODS: To investigate the association between serum sodium concentration and mortality, we conducted a prospective cohort study of 98,411 adults hospitalized between 2000 and 2003 at 2 teaching hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts. The main outcome measures were in-hospital, 1-year, and 5-year mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare outcomes in patients with varying degrees of hyponatremia against those with normal serum sodium concentration. RESULTS: Hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration <135 mEq/L) was observed in 14.5% of patients on initial measurement. Compared with patients with normonatremia (135-144 mEq/L), those with hyponatremia were older (67.0 vs 63.1 years, P <.001) and had more comorbid conditions (mean Deyo-Charlson Index 1.9 vs 1.4, P <.001). In multivariable-adjusted models, patients with hyponatremia had an increased risk of death in hospital (odds ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-1.62), at 1 year (hazard ratio 1.38, 95% CI, 1.32-1.46), and at 5 years (hazard ratio 1.25, 95% CI, 1.21-1.30). The increased risk of death was evident even in those with mild hyponatremia (130-134 mEq/L; odds ratio 1.37, 95% CI, 1.23-1.52). The relationship between hyponatremia and mortality was pronounced in patients admitted with cardiovascular disease, metastatic cancer, and those admitted for procedures related to the musculoskeletal system. Resolution of hyponatremia during hospitalization attenuated the increased mortality risk conferred by hyponatremia. CONCLUSION: Hyponatremia, even when mild, is associated with increased mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {Software to perform record linkage should have several characteristics: (1) portability in being able to function with researchers' current arrangement of computer systems and languages, (2) flexibility in handling different linkage strategies, and (3) low cost in both computer time and researchers' efforts. A linkage package (LINKS) is described which satisfies these criteria; LINKS provides tools for both deterministic and probabilistic linkage as well as test modules for assessing data quality and structure. Because each linkage project is different, the modular nature of the software allows for better control of the programming process and development of unique strategies. Since the user provides the weights and decision rules, he may modify data between steps and/or develop extra steps to supplement the basic modules. In two information-rich linkage projects involving California AIDS data, LINKS identified mortality using deterministic approaches and permitted comparisons with other software and strategies. Flexible software and a deterministic approach would have eliminated the expensive key entry used to add full names and social security numbers as additional identifiers to one of the California data files.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: The incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax is 24/100,000 a year in men and 9.9/100,000 in women in England and Wales. The major contributing factor is smoking, which increases the likelihood by 22 times in men, and by 8 times in women. While death from spontaneous pneumothorax is rare, rates of recurrence are high, with one study of men in the US finding a total recurrence rate of 35%. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in people presenting with spontaneous pneumothorax? What are the effects of interventions to prevent recurrence in people with previous spontaneous pneumothorax? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to April 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 16 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: chest-tube drainage (alone or plus suction), chest tubes (small, standard sizes, one-way valves), needle aspiration, and pleurodesis.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: In the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, simple aspiration is technically easier to perform. A systematic review may better define the clinical effectiveness and safety of simple aspiration compared to intercostal tube drainage in the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinically efficacy and safety of simple aspiration and intercostal tube drainage in the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2006), and EMBASE (1980 to August 2006). We searched Current Controlled Trials metaRegister of Clinical Trials (compiled by Current Science) (August 2006). We checked the reference lists of trials and contacted trial authors . We imposed no language restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing simple aspiration with intercostal tube drainage in adults aged 18 and over with primary spontaneous pneumothorax. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. No statistical methods were necessary because only one study met the inclusion criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 1239 publications obtained from the search strategy, we examined six studies. Five studies were excluded, and one study of 60 participants was eligible for inclusion. There was no difference in immediate success rate of simple aspiration when compared with intercostal tube drainage in the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (relative risk (RR) = 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.40). There was no significant difference in the early failure rate between the two interventions: RR 1.12 (95% CI 0.59 to 2.13). Simple aspiration reduced the proportion of patients hospitalized (RR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.75). There was no significant difference between the two interventions with regard to the following outcome measures: duration of hospitalization (weighted mean difference = 1.09; 95% CI 2.18 to 0.00); number of participants undergoing any procedure for lung pleurodesis within one year (RR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.41 to 2.22);and one year success rate (RR = 1.02; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.38). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference between simple aspiration and intercostal tube drainage with regard to: immediate success rate, early failure rate, duration of hospitalisation, one year success rate and number of patients requiring pleurodesis at one year. Simple aspiration is associated with a reduction in the per cent of patients hospitalized when compared with intercostal tube drainage.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Mannitol is sometimes effective in reversing acute brain swelling, but its effectiveness in the ongoing management of severe head injury remains unclear. There is evidence that, in prolonged dosage, mannitol may pass from the blood into the brain, where it might cause increased intracranial pressure. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of different mannitol therapy regimens, of mannitol compared to other intracranial pressure (ICP) lowering agents, and to quantify the effectiveness of mannitol administration given at other stages following acute traumatic brain injury. SEARCH STRATEGY: The review drew on the search strategy for the Injuries Group as a whole. We checked reference lists of trials and review articles, and contacted authors of trials. The searches were last updated in March 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of mannitol, in patients with acute traumatic brain injury of any severity. The comparison group could be placebo-controlled, no drug, different dose, or different drug. We excluded cross-over trials, and trials where the intervention was started more than eight weeks after injury. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently rated quality of allocation concealment and extracted the data. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial on an intention to treat basis. MAIN RESULTS: We identified four eligible randomised controlled trials. One trial compared ICP-directed therapy to 'standard care' (RR for death = 0.83; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.46). One trial compared mannitol to pentobarbital (RR for death = 0.85; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38). One trial compared mannitol to hypertonic saline (RR for death = 1.25; 95% CI 0.47 to 3.33). One trial tested the effectiveness of pre-hospital administration of mannitol against placebo (RR for death = 1.75; 95% CI 0.48 to 6.38). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Mannitol therapy for raised ICP may have a beneficial effect on mortality when compared to pentobarbital treatment, but may have a detrimental effect on mortality when compared to hypertonic saline. ICP-directed treatment shows a small beneficial effect compared to treatment directed by neurological signs and physiological indicators. There are insufficient data on the effectiveness of pre-hospital administration of mannitol.},

Support Vector Machine (SVM) used for comparison in cohort selection testing. Calibration by model refitting to outcome prevalence.Predicting readmission risk across multiple reasons for readmission resulted in ROC areas ranging from 0.92 for readmission for congestive heart failure to 0.71 for syncope and 0.68 for all-cause readmission. Visit history and laboratory tests contributed the most predictive value; contributions varied by readmission diagnosis. Cohort definition affected performance for both parametric and nonparametric algorithms. Compared to all patients, limiting the cohort to patients whose index admission and readmission diagnoses matched resulted in a decrease in average ROC from 0.78 to 0.55 (difference in ROC 0.23, p value 0.01). Calibration plots demonstrate good calibration with low mean squared error.Targeting reason for readmission in risk prediction impacted discriminatory performance. In general, laboratory data and visit history data contributed the most to prediction; data source contributions varied by reason for readmission. Cohort selection had a large impact on model performance, and these results demonstrate the difficulty of comparing results across different studies of predictive risk modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Previous studies suggest improved patient outcomes for providers who perform high volumes of complex medical procedures. Out-of-hospital tracheal intubation is a difficult procedure. We seek to determine the association between rescuer procedural experience and patient survival after out-of-hospital tracheal intubation. METHODS: We analyzed probabilistically linked Pennsylvania statewide emergency medicine services, hospital discharge, and death data of patients receiving out-of-hospital tracheal intubation. We defined tracheal intubation experience as cumulative tracheal intubation during 2000 to 2005; low=1 to 10 tracheal intubations, medium=11 to 25 tracheal intubations, high=26 to 50 tracheal intubations, and very high=greater than 50 tracheal intubations. We identified survival on hospital discharge of patients intubated during 2003 to 2005. Using generalized estimating equations, we evaluated the association between patient survival and out-of-hospital rescuer cumulative tracheal intubation experience, adjusted for clinical covariates. RESULTS: During 2003 to 2005, 4,846 rescuers performed tracheal intubation. These individuals performed tracheal intubation on 33,117 patients during 2003 to 2005 and 62,586 patients during 2000 to 2005. Among 21,753 cardiac arrests, adjusted odds of survival was higher for patients intubated by rescuers with very high tracheal intubation experience; adjusted odds ratio (OR) versus low tracheal intubation experience: very high 1.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15 to 1.89), high 1.13 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.31), and medium 1.02 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.15). Among 8,162 medical nonarrests, adjusted odds of survival were higher for patients intubated by rescuers with high and very high tracheal intubation experience; adjusted OR versus low tracheal intubation experience: very high 1.55 (95% CI 1.08 to 2.22), high 1.29 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.59), and medium 1.16 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.38). Among 3,202 trauma nonarrests, survival was not associated with rescuer tracheal intubation experience; adjusted OR versus low tracheal intubation experience: very high 1.84 (95% CI 0.89 to 3.81), high 1.25 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.85), and medium 0.92 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.26). CONCLUSION: Rescuer procedural experience is associated with improved patient survival after out-of-hospital tracheal intubation of cardiac arrest and medical nonarrest patients. Rescuer procedural experience is not associated with patient survival after out-of-hospital tracheal intubation of trauma nonarrest patients.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of International Classification of Disease Ninth Revision Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) hospital discharge codes to define degenerative cervical spine surgery in comparison to patient operative notes in the medical record. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Population-based studies of spine surgery have often relied on administrative databases as a primary information source, but little is known about the validity of using ICD9-CM codes to identify these operations. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study comparing ICD9-CM billing codes to patient operative notes, the gold standard, for patients undergoing spine surgery in 2006 at a single academic center. RESULTS: We identified 1090 procedures of which 265 were categorized as cervical spine surgery for degenerative indications based on the operative notes. Compared to operative notes, our ICD9-CM algorithm had high sensitivity and specificity for selecting surgery at the cervical spine level and cervical spine surgery for degenerative indications. Categorization of cases by procedure had high sensitivity and specificity for fusion and surgical approach (>95%). Categorization of cases by primary diagnosis was generally less accurate. Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy was the most sensitive primary diagnosis. Categorization of cases by procedure had high sensitivity and specificity for fusion and surgical approach (>/=96%). However, diagnoses such as herniated disc and procedures such as laminectomy had low sensitivity but high specificity. CONCLUSION: The use of our ICD9-CM algorithm to define spine surgery at the cervical spine level, and degenerative cervical spine surgery is highly accurate. Although specific diagnoses codes are mostly insensitive, an ICD9-CM algorithm can be used to study these procedures with reasonable precision.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a combined Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) algorithm in defining cervical spine surgery in comparison to patient operative reports in the medical record. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Epidemiological studies of spine surgery often use ICD-9-CM billing codes in administrative databases to study trends and outcome of surgery. However, ICD-9-CM codes do not clearly identify specific surgical factors that may be related to outcome, such as instrumentation or number of levels treated. Previous studies have not investigated the sensitivity and specificity of a combined CPT and ICD-9-CM code algorithm for defining cervical spine surgical procedures. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study comparing the sensitivity and specificity of a combined CPT and ICD-9-CM code algorithm to the operative note, the gold standard, in a single academic center. We also compared the accuracy of our combined algorithm with our published ICD-9-CM-only algorithm. RESULTS: The combined algorithm has high sensitivity and specificity for defining cervical spine surgery, specific surgical procedures such as discectomy and fusion, and surgical approach. Compared to the ICD-9-CM-only algorithm, the combined algorithm significantly improves identification of discectomy, laminectomy, and fusion procedures and allows identification of specific procedures such as laminaplasty and instrumentation with high sensitivity and specificity. Identification of reoperations has low sensitivity and specificity, but identification of number of levels instrumented, fused, and decompressed has high specificity. CONCLUSION: The use of our combined CPT and ICD-9-CM algorithm to identify cervical spine surgery was highly sensitive and specific. For categories such as surgical approach, accuracy of our combined algorithm was similar to that of our ICD-9-CM-only algorithm. However, the combined algorithm improves sensitivity, and allows identification of procedures not defined by ICD-9-CM procedure codes, and number of levels instrumented and decompressed. The combined algorithm better defines cervical spine surgery and specific factors that may impact outcome and cost.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Etomidate is an induction agent used for the rapid sequence intubation (RSI) of trauma patients because of its favorable hemodynamic profile and rapid onset. However, recent studies have shown etomidate to decrease circulating cortisol concentrations, potentially influencing inflammation. We hypothesized that etomidate may alter the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in injury victims. METHODS: We analyzed data collected prospectively from a clinical trial of prehospital hypertonic saline administration. Post hoc, patients were grouped according to whether they did or did not receive etomidate for prehospital airway management. The incidence of ARDS was compared between the two groups by Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression was used to adjust for the effects of other known risk factors for ARDS. RESULTS: Over a 2-year period, 94 study patients underwent RSI, of which 35 received etomidate (37%). There were no significant differences in demographic, physiology, anatomic injury scores, or use of hypertonic saline resuscitation between the groups. After adjusting for physiology, injury severity, and transfusion, etomidate use remained associated with ARDS (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI =1.24-12.0). CONCLUSION: Single-dose etomidate for RSI in severely injured trauma patients is associated with increased ARDS and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, in part, because of an effect of etomidate on the inflammatory response.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the attributable cost of ventilator-associated pneumonia from a hospital-based cost perspective, after adjusting for potential confounders. DESIGN: Patients admitted between January 19, 1998, and December 31, 1999, were followed prospectively for the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Hospital costs were defined by using the hospital cost accounting database. SETTING: The medical and surgical intensive care units at a suburban, tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Patients requiring >24 hrs of mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, in-hospital mortality rate, total intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay (LOS), and total hospital cost per patient. Ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in 127 of 819 patients (15.5%). Compared with uninfected, ventilated patients, patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia had a higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score on admission (p <.001) and were more likely to require multiple intubations (p <.001), hemodialysis (p <.001), tracheostomy (p <.001), central venous catheters (p <.001), and corticosteroids (p <.001). Patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia were more likely to be bacteremic during their ICU stay (36 [28%] vs. 22 [3%]; p <.001). Patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia had significantly higher unadjusted ICU LOS (26 vs. 4 days; p <.001), hospital LOS (38 vs. 13 days; p <.001), mortality rate (64 [50%] vs. 237 [34%]; p <.001), and hospital costs (70,568 dollars vs. 21,620 dollars, p <.001). Multiple linear regression, controlling for other factors that may affect costs, estimated the attributable cost of ventilator-associated pneumonia to be 11,897 dollars (95% confidence interval = 5,265 dollars-26,214 dollars; p <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia had significantly longer ICU and hospital LOS, with higher crude hospital cost and mortality rate compared with uninfected patients. After we adjusted for underlying severity of illness, the attributable cost of ventilator-associated pneumonia was approximately 11,897 dollars.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To summarize the scope and epidemiology of pediatric sepsis. DESIGN: Review of published literature. RESULTS: Sepsis is a leading cause of death in infants and children, with >42,000 cases of severe sepsis annually in the United States and millions worldwide. Half of the children with severe sepsis in the United States are infants, and half of infants are low- or very low-birth-weight babies. Underlying disease occurs in 49% of U.S. children with severe sepsis. National hospital costs associated with severe sepsis in the United States were $2.3 billion in 1999. Relatively simple strategies to identify and treat children with sepsis in the developing world have shown remarkable success. These strategies have included empirical antibiotics in babies at high risk of sepsis and aggressive fluid resuscitation in Dengue hemorrhagic fever. CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis is a major health problem among children in both developing and industrialized countries. However, sepsis is both preventable and treatable. Improved prevention and treatment of sepsis could have a substantial effect on survival and quality of life of all children, both those who are otherwise healthy and those who are chronically ill. The variations in the epidemiology of pediatric sepsis underscore the need for a multidisciplinary approach and consistently applied definitions.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite extensive research into the etiology and treatment of severe sepsis, little is known about its epidemiology in children. We sought to determine the age- and sex-adjusted incidence, outcome, and associated hospital costs of severe sepsis in United States children using 1995 hospital discharge and population data from seven states (24% of the United States population). Of 1,586,253 hospitalizations in children who were 19 years old or less, 9,675 met International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification-based severe sepsis criteria or 42,364 cases of pediatric severe sepsis per year nationally (0.56 cases per 1,000 population per year). The incidence was the highest in infants (5.16 per 1,000), fell dramatically in older children (0.20 per 1,000 in 10 to 14 year olds), and was 15% higher in boys than in girls (0.60 versus 0.52 per 1,000, p < 0.001). Hospital mortality was 10.3%, or 4,383 deaths nationally (6.2 per 100,000 population). Half of the cases had underlying disease (49.0%), and over one-fifth (22.9%) were low-birth-weight newborns. Respiratory infections (37%) and primary bacteremia (25%) were the most common infections. The mean length of stay and cost were 31 days and $40,600, respectively. Estimated annual total costs were 1.97 billion US dollars nationally. Severe sepsis is a significant health problem in children and is associated with the use of extensive healthcare resources. Infants are at highest risk, especially those with a low birth weight.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To describe variation regarding inpatient therapy and evaluation of children with Henoch Schonlein purpura (HSP) admitted to children's hospitals across the United States. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children discharged with a diagnosis of HSP between 2000 and 2007 by use of inpatient administrative data from 36 children's hospitals. We examined variation among hospitals in the use of medications, diagnostic tests, and intensive care services with multivariate mixed effects logistic regression models. RESULTS: During the initial HSP hospitalization (n = 1988), corticosteroids were the most common medication (56% of cases), followed by opioids (36%), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (35%), and antihypertensive drugs (11%). After adjustment for patient characteristics, hospitals varied significantly in their use of corticosteroids, opioids, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; the use of diagnostic abdominal imaging, endoscopy, laboratory testing, and renal biopsy; and the use of intensive care services. By contrast, hospitals did not differ significantly regarding administration of antihypertensive drugs or performance of skin biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: The significant variation identified may contribute to varying HSP clinical outcomes between hospitals, warrants further investigation, and represents a potentially important opportunity to improve quality of care.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize the effect of corticosteroid exposure on clinical outcomes in children hospitalized with new-onset Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children discharged with an International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification code of HSP between 2000 and 2007 by using inpatient administrative data from 36 tertiary care children's hospitals. We used stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the relative effect of time-varying corticosteroid exposure on the risks of clinical outcomes that occur during hospitalization for acute HSP. RESULTS: During the 8-year study period, there were 1895 hospitalizations for new-onset HSP. After multivariable regression modeling adjustment, early corticosteroid exposure significantly reduced the hazard ratios for abdominal surgery (0.39 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17-0.91]), endoscopy (0.27 [95% CI: 0.13-0.55]), and abdominal imaging (0.50 [95% CI: 0.29-0.88]) during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: In the hospital setting, early corticosteroid exposure was associated with benefits for several clinically relevant HSP outcomes, specifically those related to the gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if hospitalizations for specific infectious exposures are associated with hospital admissions for Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data of children admitted to 40 children's hospitals between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. We examined the association of standardized rates of group A ss-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABS), Staphylococcus aureus, parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated hospital admissions with standardized rates of HSP hospital admissions on a month by month basis using autoregressive moving average process models to account for temporal autocorrelation and clustering by hospital. RESULTS: Among the 3,132 admissions for HSP observed over the 7-year study period, hospital admissions were most frequent September through April, but with substantial variability between hospitals for each month. Accounting for these month by month differences within each hospital, the rate of HSP admissions in a given month increased significantly as the standardized rates of GABS (p = 0.01), S. aureus (p < 0.01), and parainfluenza (p = 0.03) admissions increased. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate a local month by month temporal association between hospitalization for GABS, S. aureus, and parainfluenza and hospitalization for HSP.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the association between pediatric cardiac surgical volume and mortality using sophisticated case-mix adjustment and a national clinical database. METHODS: Patients 18 years of age or less who had a cardiac operation between 2002 and 2006 were identified in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (32,413 patients from 48 programs). Programs were grouped by yearly pediatric cardiac surgical volume (small, <150; medium, 150-249; large, 250-349; and very large, >or=350 cases per year). Logistic regression was used to adjust mortality rates for volume, surgical case mix (Aristotle Basic Complexity and Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery, Version 1 categories), patient risk factors, and year of operation. RESULTS: With adjustment for patient-level risk factors and surgical case mix, there was an inverse relationship between overall surgical volume as a continuous variable and mortality (P = .002). When the data were displayed graphically, there appeared to be an inflection point between 200 and 300 cases per year. When volume was analyzed as a categorical variable, the relationship was most apparent for difficult operations (Aristotle technical difficulty component score, >3.0), for which mortality decreased from 14.8% (60/406) at small programs to 8.4% (157/1858) at very large programs (P = .02). The same was true for the subgroup of patients who underwent Norwood procedures (36.5% [23/63] vs 16.9% [81/479], P < .0001). After risk adjustment, all groups performed similarly for low-difficulty operations. Conversely, for difficult procedures, small programs performed significantly worse. For Norwood procedures, very large programs outperformed all other groups. CONCLUSION: There was an inverse association between pediatric cardiac surgical volume and mortality that became increasingly important as case complexity increased. Although volume was not associated with mortality for low-complexity cases, lower-volume programs underperformed larger programs as case complexity increased.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to define the incidence of permanent shunt placement and infection in patients who have undergone the 2 most commonly performed temporizing procedures for posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) of prematurity: ventriculosubgaleal (VSG) shunt placement and ventricular reservoir placement for intermittent tapping. METHODS: The 4 centers of the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network participated in a retrospective chart review of infants with PHH who underwent treatment at each institution between 2001 and 2006. Patients were included if they had received a diagnosis of Grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, weighed < 1500 g at birth, and had received surgical intervention. The authors determined the incidence of conversion from a temporizing device to a permanent shunt, the incidence of CSF infection during temporization, and the 6-month CSF infection rate after permanent shunt placement. RESULTS: Thirty-one (86%) of 36 patients who received VSG shunts and 61 (69%) of 88 patients who received ventricular reservoirs received permanent CSF diversion with a shunt (p = 0.05). Five patients (14%) in the VSG shunt group had CSF infections during temporization, compared with 11 patients (13%) in the ventricular reservoir group (p = 0.83). The 6-month incidence of permanent shunt infection in the VSG shunt group was 16% (5 of 31), compared with 12% (7 of 61) in the reservoir placement group (p = 0.65). For the first 6 months after permanent shunt placement, infants with no preceding temporizing procedure had an infection rate of 5% (1 of 20 infants) and those who had undergone a temporizing procedure had an infection rate of 13% (12 of 92; p = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: The use of intermittent tapping of ventricular reservoirs in this population appears to lead to a lower incidence of permanent shunt placement than the use of VSG shunts. The incidence of infection during temporization and for the initial 6 months after conversion appears comparable for both groups.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Intravenous immunoglobulin as an adjunctive treatment in sepsis was regarded as promising by a Cochrane meta-analysis of smaller trials. In this phase III multicenter trial, we assessed whether intravenous immunoglobulin G (ivIgG) reduced 28-day mortality and improved morbidity in patients with score-defined severe sepsis. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. SETTING: Twenty-three medical and surgical intensive care units in university centers and large teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Patients (n = 653) with score-defined sepsis (sepsis score 12-27) and score-defined sepsis-induced severity of disease (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 20-35). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned to receive either placebo or ivIgG (day 0, 0.6 g/kg body weight; day 1, 0.3 g/kg body weight). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The prospectively defined primary end point was death from any cause after 28 days. Prospectively defined secondary end points were 7-day all-cause mortality, short-term change in morbidity, and pulmonary function at day 4. Six hundred fifty-three patients from 23 active centers formed the intention-to-treat group, 624 patients the per-protocol group (placebo group, n = 303; ivIgG group, n = 321). The 28-day mortality rate was 37.3% in the placebo group and 39.3% in the ivIgG group and thus not significantly different (p = .6695). Seven-day mortality was not reduced, and 4-day pulmonary function was not improved. Drug-related adverse events were rare in both groups. Exploratory findings revealed a 3-day shortening of mechanical ventilation in the surviving patients and no effect of ivIgG on plasma levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor receptors I and II. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with score-defined severe sepsis, ivIgG with a total dose of 0.9 g/kg body weight does not reduce mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to compare intensive care units (ICUs) and determine whether they provide the same level of care with regard to efficacy, efficiency, and quality is a cornerstone of understanding critical care and improving the quality of that care. Without collecting high-quality data, adjusted for severity of illness and analyzed in a comparative fashion, it would not be possible to describe best practices objectively, to identify which ICUs are doing a good job or to learn from those units that are. This review article discusses how and why ICUs are compared. Particular attention is focused on the severity of illness scores, standardized mortality, and comparative reporting. A data collecting network, Virtual Pediatric Systems, limited liability corporation (VPS, LLC), designed for the purposes of determining where differences in critical care can be identified and the value that this adds in improving quality is discussed. Finally, results from this large data sharing collaborative describing the practice of pediatric critical care are included for the purpose of pediatric intensive care units practice benchmarks. 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

METHODS: We evaluated the relationship of benefits and risks of PACs in 1000 patients with established acute lung injury in a randomized trial comparing hemodynamic management guided by a PAC with hemodynamic management guided by a central venous catheter (CVC) using an explicit management protocol. Mortality during the first 60 days before discharge home was the primary outcome. RESULTS: The groups had similar baseline characteristics. The rates of death during the first 60 days before discharge home were similar in the PAC and CVC groups (27.4 percent and 26.3 percent, respectively; P=0.69; absolute difference, 1.1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -4.4 to 6.6 percent), as were the mean (+/-SE) numbers of both ventilator-free days (13.2+/-0.5 and 13.5+/-0.5; P=0.58) and days not spent in the intensive care unit (12.0+/-0.4 and 12.5+/-0.5; P=0.40) to day 28. PAC-guided therapy did not improve these measures for patients in shock at the time of enrollment. There were no significant differences between groups in lung or kidney function, rates of hypotension, ventilator settings, or use of dialysis or vasopressors. Approximately 90 percent of protocol instructions were followed in both groups, with a 1 percent rate of crossover from CVC- to PAC-guided therapy. Fluid balance was similar in the two groups, as was the proportion of instructions given for fluid and diuretics. Dobutamine use was uncommon. The PAC group had approximately twice as many catheter-related complications (predominantly arrhythmias). CONCLUSIONS: PAC-guided therapy did not improve survival or organ function but was associated with more complications than CVC-guided therapy. These results, when considered with those of previous studies, suggest that the PAC should not be routinely used for the management of acute lung injury. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00281268.).},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Determine variables in the acute care period associated with survival and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) length of stay (LOS) for children with severe traumatic brain injury. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Level 1 pediatric trauma center. PATIENTS: Children (0-17 yrs) admitted 1991 to 1995 with nonpenetrating traumatic brain injury and admission Glasgow Coma Scale score of <or=8. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The first 72 hrs of hospitalization were analyzed in detail for 136 patients. The primary end point was survival; secondary end points were PICU LOS, cost, and day at which Glasgow Coma Scale score was >or=14. Predictors of outcome were abstracted, including Pediatric Trauma Score, Glasgow Coma Scale score, Pediatric Risk of Mortality, physiologic variables, computed tomography evidence of brain injury, and neuroresuscitative medications. The fatality rate was 24%. Age and gender were similar between groups (p >or= .1). Survival was independently predicted by 6-hr Glasgow Coma Scale score (odds ratio [OR] 4.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.06-11.9; p < .001) and maximum systolic blood pressure (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01-1.09; p < .02). Odds of survival increased 19-fold when maximum systolic blood pressure was >or=135 mm Hg (OR 18.8; 95% CI 2.0-178.0; p < .01). By discharge, 67% of patients had an age-appropriate Glasgow Coma Scale score. Median hospital costs were 8,798 dollars for survivors: only mannitol use independently predicted high cost (odds ratio 4.9; 95% CI 1.2-19.1; p < .01). For survivors, median PICU LOS was 2 days, although 25% had LOS >6 days. Six-hour Glasgow Coma Scale score (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48-0.80; p < .001) and mannitol (OR 7.9; 95% CI 2.3-27.3; p < .001) were each independently associated with a prolonged LOS among survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with higher 6-hr Glasgow Coma Scale scores were more likely to survive. Adjusting for severity of injury, survival was associated with maximum systolic blood pressure >or=135 mm Hg, suggesting that supranormal blood pressures are associated with improved outcome. Mannitol administration was associated with prolonged LOS, yet conferred no survival advantage. We suggest reevaluation of blood pressure targets and mannitol use in children with severe traumatic brain injury.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children presenting with acute non-traumatic hip pain was evaluated prospectively. Hip MRI was performed in addition to standard investigations (arthrosonography +/- hip radiographs) in 50 children presenting to the accident and emergency department of a paediatric hospital. MRI was performed on an open 0.23T system and comprised gradient echo T1 weighted coronal, fast spin echo T2 weighted coronal and inversion recovery spin echo (IRSE) axial sequences. Diagnostic quality MRI examinations were obtained in 94% of children. The IRSE sequence was the most reliable at determining underlying disorder (p<0.002). Interobserver agreement on the MRI examinations was very good with unweighted kappa value of 0.89, 95% confidence intervals 0.79, 0.99. Sensitivity of MRI was 0.79 (0.68, 0.90, specificity 1.00 (0.89, 1.00), accuracy 0.81 (0.70, 0.92), PPV 1.00 (0.89, 1), NPV 0.36 (0.25, 0.47). Sensitivity of standard imaging was 0.70 (0.54-0.86), specificity 0.57 (0.41, 0.73), accuracy 0.72 (0.56, 0.88), PPV 0.91 (0.75, 1.00), NPV 0.24 (0.08, 0.40). MRI correctly identified all seven children with serious underlying disorder whereas conventional imaging correctly diagnosed only two. Pelvic musculoskeletal infection was associated with the combination of marked alteration in signal in tissues adjacent to a symptomatic hip and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of >20 mm 1st h (p<0.0001). In conclusion, MRI is a practical, well accepted and accurate non-invasive imaging technique in children presenting with acute non-traumatic hip pain. Combined with inflammatory markers MRI can be used to determine those children who require aggressive management. Where it is available, MRI is the imaging modality of choice in this condition.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The epidemiology of severe sepsis is derived from administrative databases that rely on International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to select cases. We compared the sensitivity of two code abstraction methods in identifying severe sepsis cases using a severe sepsis registry. DESIGN: Single-center retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary care, Academic, University Hospital. PATIENTS: One thousand seven hundred thirty-five patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: Proportion identified as severe sepsis using two code abstraction methods: 1) the new specific ICD-9 codes for severe sepsis and septic shock, and 2) a validated method requiring two ICD-9 codes for infection and end-organ dysfunction. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine sociodemographics and clinical characteristics associated with documentation and coding accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: The strategy combining a code for infection and end-organ dysfunction was more sensitive in identifying cases than the method requiring specific ICD-9 codes for severe sepsis or septic shock (47% vs. 21%). Elevated serum lactate level (p<0.001), ICU admission (p<0.001), presence of shock (p<0.001), bacteremia as the source of sepsis (p=0.02), and increased Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (p<0.001) were independently associated with being appropriately documented and coded. The 28-day mortality was significantly higher in those who were accurately documented/coded (41%, compared with 14% in those who were not, p<0.001), reflective of a more severe presentation on admission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients admitted with severe sepsis and septic shock were incompletely documented and under-coded, using either ICD-9 code abstracting method.

This article provides background information and reviews the current literature on methods of measuring ICP in children. Indications for ICP measurement are described for children with traumatic brain injury, shunt insertion or malfunction, arachnoid cyst, craniosynostosis, and prematurity. Various methods of ICP monitoring are detailed: non-invasive, indirect (lumbar puncture, visual-evoked potentials, fontanelle compression, and optic nerve sheath), and direct assessment (ventricular cannulation, and epidural, subdural, and intraparenchymal devices). Normal levels of ICP will depend on the age and position of the child during monitoring. This article provides clinical and research-based evidence in this area where there is currently limited guidance.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To compare three International Classification of Diseases code abstraction strategies that have previously been reported to mirror severe sepsis by examining retrospective Swedish national data from 1987 to 2005 inclusive. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Swedish hospital discharge database. PATIENTS: All hospital admissions during the period 1987 to 2005 were extracted and these patients were screened for severe sepsis using the three International Classification of Diseases code abstraction strategies, which were adapted for the Swedish version of the International Classification of Diseases. Two code abstraction strategies included both International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes, whereas one included International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes alone. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The three International Classification of Diseases code abstraction strategies identified 37,990, 27,655, and 12,512 patients, respectively, with severe sepsis. The incidence increased over the years, reaching 0.35 per 1000, 0.43 per 1000, and 0.13 per 1000 inhabitants, respectively. During the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision period, we found 17,096 unique patients and of these, only 2789 patients (16%) met two of the code abstraction strategy lists and 14,307 (84%) met one list. The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision period included 46,979 unique patients, of whom 8% met the criteria of all three International Classification of Diseases code abstraction strategies, 7% met two, and 84% met one only. CONCLUSIONS: The three different International Classification of Diseases code abstraction strategies generated three almost separate cohorts of patients with severe sepsis. Thus, the International Classification of Diseases code abstraction strategies for recording severe sepsis in use today provides an unsatisfactory way of estimating the true incidence of severe sepsis. Further studies relating International Classification of Diseases code abstraction strategies to the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine scores are needed.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: When initiated within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, oseltamivir has been shown to reduce severity and length of influenza illness. Few studies have evaluated the use of oseltamivir in patients hospitalized with influenza. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prescribing practices for oseltamivir in children hospitalized with influenza and to evaluate a mechanism to improve the rate of appropriate prescription. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort study of 929 patients aged 21 years or younger hospitalized with community-acquired laboratory-confirmed influenza (CA-LCI) during 5 consecutive seasons (2000-2005). We examined oseltamivir eligibility, which included patients 1 year of age or older with an influenza test result available within 48 hours of symptom onset. During the 2005-2006 season, an observational trial of an electronic reminder was conducted to improve the frequency of oseltamivir prescription. MEASUREMENTS: Oseltamivir prescription. RESULTS: Of 305 patients (32.8%) eligible for treatment with oseltamivir, 49 (16.1% of those eligible) were prescribed oseltamivir during hospitalization. Prescription rates for indications consistent with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval ("on label") increased from 0% to 37.2% over 5 seasons (P < 0.0001). Prescriptions outside this recommendation ("off label") also increased over 5 seasons (P < 0.0001). Twenty-nine (5%) of 624 patients were treated with oseltamivir off label; 11 were less than 1 year of age. Initiation of a reminder had no impact on prescription (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Oseltamivir was used infrequently for children hospitalized with influenza. In addition, use inconsistent with the FDA label of oseltamivir occurs. Mechanisms are needed to improve appropriate prescription of oseltamivir.},

  Abstract                 = {Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains one of the most common indications for pediatric hospitalization in the United States, and it is frequently the focus of research and quality studies. Use of administrative data is increasingly common for these purposes, although proper validation is required to ensure valid study conclusions.To validate administrative billing data for hospitalizations owing to childhood CAP.Case-control study of 4 tertiary care, freestanding children’s hospitals in the United States.A total of 998 medical records of a 25\% random sample of 3646 children discharged in 2010 with at least 1 International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code representing possible pneumonia were reviewed. Discharges (matched on date of admission) without a pneumonia-related discharge code were also examined to identify potential missed pneumonia cases. Two reference standards, based on provider diagnosis alone (provider confirmed) or in combination with consistent clinical and radiographic evidence of pneumonia (definite), were used to identify CAP.Twelve ICD-9-CM–based coding strategies, each using a combination of primary or secondary codes representing pneumonia or pneumonia-related complications. Six algorithms excluded children with complex chronic conditions.Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV, respectively) of the 12 identification strategies.For provider-confirmed CAP (n = 680), sensitivity ranged from 60.7\% to 99.7\%; specificity, 75.7\% to 96.4\%; PPV, 67.9\% to 89.6\%; and NPV, 82.6\% to 99.8\%. For definite CAP (n = 547), sensitivity ranged from 65.6\% to 99.6\%; specificity, 68.7\% to 93.0\%; PPV, 54.6\% to 77.9\%; and NPV, 87.8\% to 99.8\%. Unrestricted use of the pneumonia-related codes was inaccurate, although several strategies improved specificity to more than 90\% with a variable effect on sensitivity. Excluding children with complex chronic conditions demonstrated the most favorable performance characteristics. Performance of the algorithms was similar across institutions.Administrative data are valuable for studying pediatric CAP hospitalizations. The strategies presented here will aid in the accurate identification of relevant and comparable patient populations for research and performance improvement studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Pediatric critical care was formally recognized as a separate subspecialty in pediatrics in 1987. Since that time the numbers of pediatric intensivists, pediatric intensive care units, and pediatric intensive care beds in the United States have increased dramatically. Research efforts have lagged behind, however, as this new discipline has struggled to identify the necessary time, funding, and other resources to pursue clinical and laboratory investigation. In April 2004, the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research of the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development issued a request for applications to establish the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN). The CPCCRN provides an infrastructure to pursue collaborative clinical trials and descriptive studies in pediatric critical care medicine. Six pediatric centers involving seven intensive care units and a data-coordinating center were identified through a competitive application process. Network goals include the support of collaborative clinical trials otherwise impracticable in single institutions and the establishment of a framework for developing the scientific basis for pediatric critical care practice. This article describes how the CPCCRN was established, its organization, and its goals and future plans.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Acute fulminant myocarditis is a life-threatening disease in children. A limited number of reports suggest that mechanical circulatory support (MCS) may be used to successfully bridge children with acute fulminant myocarditis to recovery or transplantation. We evaluated the effectiveness of MCS in children with myocarditis and identified risk factors associated with adverse outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2009, 16 children were treated for myocarditis at our institution; each child received MCS provided by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ventricular assist device(s), or both. Of these patients, 75% (12/16) survived: 7 recovered ventricular function, and 5 underwent successful orthotopic heart transplantation. In patients who were bridged to recovery, mean left ventricular ejection fraction significantly improved from initiation to termination of MCS (20 +/- 9.3% to 62 +/- 5%; P = .0004). Viral pathogens were detected in 11 patients by polymerase chain reaction, and viral presence was associated with death or need for transplantation (P = .011). Upon histologic analysis, absence of viral infection and lack of myocardial inflammation were associated with recovery (P values .011 and .044, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In children with acute fulminant and persistent myocarditis, MCS is a life-saving treatment strategy, particularly in the absence of viral infection.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) established guidelines that rely on simple clinical signs for the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia in resource-limited settings. Our objective was to evaluate the test characteristics of the WHO criteria for the diagnosis of radiographic pneumonia in the emergency department setting. METHODS: We prospectively collected clinical information from children </=5 years of age presenting to a US-based pediatric emergency department who had a chest radiograph performed for suspicion of pneumonia. Patients were classified as meeting the WHO case definition of pneumonia if they had both 1) cough or difficulty breathing and 2) age-specific WHO-defined tachypnea. The primary outcome was radiographic pneumonia based on the final radiology report. Among children with cough or with difficulty breathing, receiver operator characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the test characteristics of triage respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen saturation for the diagnosis of radiographic pneumonia. RESULTS: Two thousand eight children were enrolled. Median age was 19 months, and 28.5% had tachypnea based upon age-specific respiratory rate thresholds. Of the 324 children with radiographic pneumonia, 111 met the WHO case definition of pneumonia (sensitivity = 34.3%, 95% confidence interval: 29.1-39.7). Triage respiratory rate demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.54 for the diagnosis of radiographic pneumonia. The area under the curve for triage temperature and oxygen saturation was 0.56 and 0.60, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The WHO criteria demonstrated poor sensitivity for the diagnosis of radiographic pneumonia in a US-based pediatric emergency department. Compared with respiratory rate, oxygen saturation offered slightly improved test characteristics. Although applied to a different target population, these findings suggest the WHO criteria may not be a sensitive screening tool for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: We identified the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of nosocomial bloodstream isolates in pediatric patients in the US Prospective surveillance for nosocomial bloodstream infections at 49 hospitals during a 6-year period [Surveillance and Control of Pathogens of Epidemiologic Importance (SCOPE)] detected 22 609 bloodstream infections, of which 3432 occurred in patients < or =16 years of age. RESULTS: Gram-positive organisms accounted for 65% of cases, Gram-negative organisms accounted for 24% of cases and 11% were caused by fungi. The overall crude mortality was 14% (475 of 3432) but notably higher for infections caused by Candida spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 20 and 29%, respectively. The most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (43%), enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. (each, 9%). The mean interval between admission and infection averaged 21 days for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 25 days for S. aureus and Candida spp., 32 days for Klebsiella spp. and 34 days for Enterococcus spp. The proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus increased from 10% in 1995 to 29% in 2001. Vancomycin-resistance was seen in 1% of Enterococcus faecalis and in 11% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial BSI occurred predominantly in very young and/or critically ill children. Gram-positive pathogens predominated across all ages, and increasing antimicrobial resistance was observed in pediatric patients.},

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Forty critically ill trauma patients at high risk for VAP Intervention. Within 48 hours of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), patients were randomly assigned to receive aerosolized ceftazidime 250 mg every 12 hours or placebo (normal saline) for up to 7 days. Bronchoalveolar concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 were determined at baseline and the end of therapy (days 4-7). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The frequency of VAP in patients receiving aerosolized ceftazidime was 73% lower than that in patients receiving placebo at ICU day 14 (15% vs 55%, p = 0.021), and 54% lower for the entire ICU stay (30% vs 65%, p = 0.022). No clinically significant changes in bacterial culture and sensitivity patterns were observed. No adverse events from aerosolized ceftazidime were reported. Pulmonary TNF-alpha, IL-beta, and IL-8 concentrations were attenuated in the ceftazidime group compared with those in the placebo group (p < 0.001, p = 0.02, and p = 0.003). The frequency of VAP was related directly to changes in TNF-alpha and IL-beta (p < 0.001, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Aerosolized ceftazidime decreased the frequency of VAP in critically ill trauma patients, without adversely affecting ICU flora. Aerosolized ceftazidime also may attenuate the proinflammatory response in the lung.},

  Abstract                 = {Aerosolised administration of antibacterials remains theoretically attractive for the prevention and treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) because of the ability to generate high drug concentrations at the site of infection. There is renewed interest in this area because of the shortcomings of current therapies and increasing multidrug resistance in Gram-negative organisms. Clinical trials of aerosolised or endotracheally administered antibacterials for HAP prevention have generally been positive; however, early trials were hampered by the development of resistance related to indiscriminate use. More recent trials have shown efficacy at HAP prevention without adverse effects on microflora as a result of more limited usage. However, prophylactic aerosolised antibacterials still need to be studied in large randomised trials before they could enter widespread use. The treatment of HAP with aerosolised antibacterials has mostly been reported in case series without control groups. Both early reports with aminoglycosides and the more recent use of colistin have reported very good response rates; even with organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Aerosolised antibacterials were almost always added to intravenous therapy. On the basis of these reports, the current HAP guidelines allow the addition of aerosolised antibacterials in selected patients with multidrug-resistant organisms. This seems to be a reasonable recommendation until large trials are performed. Overall, toxicity was relatively low in the publications reviewed. Aerosolised drug administration in mechanically ventilated patients requires attention to a number of factors in order to maximise drug deposition in the lung.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in a national database the association of race and socioeconomic status with radiographic evaluation and subsequent diagnosis of child abuse after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in infants. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of infants with non-motor vehicle-associated TBI who were admitted to 39 pediatric hospitals from January 2004 to June 2008. Logistic regression controlling for age, type, and severity of TBI and the presence of other injuries was performed to examine the association of race and socioeconomic status with the principal outcomes of radiographic evaluation for suspected abuse and diagnosis of abuse. Regression coefficients were transformed to probabilities. RESULTS: After adjustment for type and severity of TBI, age, and other injuries, publicly insured/uninsured infants were more likely to have had skeletal surveys performed than were privately insured infants (81% vs 59%). The difference in skeletal survey performance for infants with public or no insurance versus private insurance was greater among white (82% vs 53%) infants than among black (85% vs 75%) or Hispanic (72% vs 55%) infants (P=.022). Although skeletal surveys were performed in a smaller proportion of white than black or Hispanic infants, the adjusted probability for diagnosis of abuse among infants evaluated with a skeletal survey was higher among white infants (61%) than among black (51%) or Hispanic (53%) infants (P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: National data suggest continued biases in the evaluation for abusive head trauma. The conflicting observations of fewer skeletal surveys among white infants and higher rates of diagnosis among those screened elicit concern for overevaluation in some infants (black or publicly insured/uninsured) or underevaluation in others (white or privately insured).},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between local macroeconomic indicators and physical abuse admission rates to pediatric hospitals over time. METHODS: Retrospective study of children admitted to 38 hospitals in the Pediatric Hospital Information System database. Hospital data were linked to unemployment, mortgage delinquency, and foreclosure data for the associated metropolitan statistical areas. Primary outcomes were admission rates for (1) physical abuse in children <6 years old, (2) non-birth, non-motor vehicle crash-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) in infants <1 year old (which carry high risk for abuse), and (3) all-cause injuries. Poisson fixed-effects regression estimated trends in admission rates and associations between those rates and trends in unemployment, mortgage delinquency, and foreclosure. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2009, rates of physical abuse and high-risk TBI admissions increased by 0.79% and 3.1% per year, respectively (P </= .02), whereas all-cause injury rates declined by 0.80% per year (P < .001). Abuse and high-risk TBI admission rates were associated with the current mortgage delinquency rate and with the change in delinquency and foreclosure rates from the previous year (P </= .03). Neither abuse nor high-risk TBI rates were associated with the current unemployment rate. The all-cause injury rate was negatively associated with unemployment, delinquency, and foreclosure rates (P </= .007). CONCLUSIONS: Multicenter hospital data show an increase in pediatric admissions for physical abuse and high-risk TBI during a time of declining all-cause injury rate. Abuse and high-risk TBI admission rates increased in relationship to local mortgage delinquency and foreclosure trends.},

However, the national rate of undertriage and diagnoses of undertriaged patients are unknown.We used the 2010 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample to estimate the national rate of undertriage, identify the prevalent diagnoses, and conduct a simulation analysis of the capacity increase required for level I and II trauma centers (TCs) to accommodate undertriaged patients. Undertriaged patients were those with major trauma, injury severity score ? 16, who received definitive care at nontrauma centers (NTCs), or level III TCs. The rate of undertriage was calculated with those receiving definitive care at an NTC center or level III center as a fraction of all major trauma patients.The estimated number of major trauma patient discharges in 2010 was 232448. Level of care was known for 197702 major trauma discharges, and 34.0\% were undertriaged in emergency departments (EDs). Elderly patients were at a significantly higher risk of being undertriaged. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was the most common diagnosis, 40.2\% of the undertriaged patient diagnoses. To accommodate all undertriaged patients, level I and II TCs nationally would have to increase their capacity by 51.5\%.We found that more than one-third of US ED major trauma patients were undertriaged, and more than 40\% of undertriaged diagnoses were TBIs. A significant capacity increase at level I and II TCs to accommodate these patients appears not feasible.},

  Abstract                 = {Obstetric complications are the major causes of death and disability in women of reproductive age. Our study aimed at investigating the use of professional healthcare when women in communities recognised possible life-threatening obstetric conditions (PLTCs). We conducted a survey in a Cambodian district with a population of 130,000. The subjects were women of reproductive age who had delivered babies during a 3-month period prior to the survey. We interviewed 980 women, and 141 (14.4%) of these had PLTCs. The utilisation rates of professional healthcare were 47% for prolonged labour; 42% for bleeding during the delivery and puerperal period; 33% for antenatal bleeding; 25% for convulsion; and 23% for postpartum high fever. A logistic regression analysis revealed that education, geographic accessibility and parity were significant determinants of seeking healthcare. Two additional determinants, namely, economic affluence and antenatal care attendance, were identified in the socioeconomic status (SES) and obstetric models.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of cervical spine injuries (CSI) in multitrauma patients, especially in the presence of head trauma, can be difficult. Identification of risk factors associated with CSI can help avoid missed or delayed diagnosis. METHODS: Trauma registry study of pedestrian injuries caused by being hit by an automobile. Data abstracted for each patient included age, gender, Glasgow Coma Score on admission, Injury Severity Score, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) for each body area, level of cervical spine injuries, and associated injuries. The incidence of spine injuries was derived for 4 age groups (14 years and younger, 15 to 55 years, 56 to 65 years, and older than 65 years). Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with CSI. RESULTS: There were 8,401 pedestrian injuries caused by automobiles, and 178 patients (2.1%) had CSI. Incidence of CSI increased with age (0.3% in the age group 14 years and younger, 2.2% in the group 15 to 55 years, 3.7% in the group 56 to 65 years, and 4.4% in the group older than 65 years). Using the youngest age group (14 years and younger) as reference, relative risk of CSI in the other groups was 7.0, 12.1, and 14.2, respectively (p < 0.0001). Patients with severe head trauma (AIS > 3) were significantly more likely to have CSI than patients with less severe head injuries (AIS <or= 3) (1.3% versus 9.0%, p < 0.0001). In the group of 5,040 injuries with no head trauma, there was not even a single case of CSI. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified age, severe head injury (AIS > 3), severe chest trauma (AIS > 3), pelvic fracture, and femur fracture as independent risk factors for CSI. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of CSI after injuries to pedestrians hit by automobiles increases with age and severity of head trauma. Age, severe head trauma, severe chest trauma, pelvic fracture, and femur fractures are independent predictors of CSI.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: We investigated the characteristics, frequency, and prognosis of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). PROCEDURE: Neurological manifestations were prospectively assessed in 92 children with HLH treated from January 2004 to August 2008 at our center; 82 (89%) had associated viral infections (69 Epstein-Barr virus), one empyema, while no associated disease was identified in the remaining nine. Prior to treatment, all underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation, brain computer tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: At diagnosis, 43 (47%) children had CNS involvement. Twelve patients (13%) had neurological symptoms, including seizures, ataxia, coma, cranial nerve palsy, and hemiplegia. All patients improved after 8 weeks of therapy, but one later developed progressive neurological symptoms and six discontinued therapy due to progressive systemic symptoms and/or other reasons. Fifteen patients had CSF abnormalities that all normalized completely after 6 weeks of treatment. Thirty-six patients (39%) had neuroradiological abnormalities; with 5 still under treatment, 15 lost to follow-up, and 16 followed after completion of therapy. Of these 16, 12 improved, 3 were unchanged, and 1 progressed. Among all 21 children with CNS involvement followed after completion of therapy, 10 recovered completely, 10 improved (3 had remaining neuroradiological abnormalities), and 1 progressed clinically and neuroradiologically. CONCLUSION: Most patients reported here suffered from secondary HLH and since CNS involvement is frequent in HLH, brain MRI at diagnosis is recommended in all HLH patients. Clinical and CSF abnormalities often improved within 8 weeks of therapy, but CT/MRI abnormalities normalized more slowly and less frequently.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of organized trauma systems is to ensure the expeditious transfer of seriously injured patients to the facility best equipped to care for their injuries. Patients are referred to our trauma center, either by ambulance or helicopter, directly from the scene or through interhospital transfer. We examined the difference in outcome between those patients sent directly to the trauma center versus those seen at other hospitals and subsequently referred to the trauma center. Our hypothesis was that a delay at the referring hospital is detrimental to patient outcome. Adult trauma patients with Injury Severity Scores > 15, treated over 16 months from July 1, 1994, to October 31, 1995, were studied. Patients who survived 24 hours experienced significantly shorter intensive care unit (14 vs 10 days; P < 0.05) and hospital (21 vs 16 days; P < 0.05) lengths of stay when taken directly to the trauma center. In addition, there were significantly fewer deaths in patients with a probability of survival > 0.5 and a slightly lower overall mortality in those patients who survived at least 1 day. This study demonstrates that patients with major trauma taken directly to the trauma center had shorter hospital and intensive care unit stays and lower mortality. The study supports the paradigm that, when possible, major trauma patients should be sent to trauma centers directly from the injury scene.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, with enormous negative social and economic impacts. The heterogeneity of TBI combined with the lack of precise outcome measures have been central to the discouraging results from clinical trials. Current approaches to the characterization of disease severity and outcome have not changed in more than three decades. This prospective multicenter observational pilot study aimed to validate the feasibility of implementing the TBI Common Data Elements (TBI-CDEs). A total of 650 subjects who underwent computed tomography (CT) scans in the emergency department within 24 h of injury were enrolled at three level I trauma centers and one rehabilitation center. The TBI-CDE components collected included: 1) demographic, social and clinical data; 2) biospecimens from blood drawn for genetic and proteomic biomarker analyses; 3) neuroimaging studies at 2 weeks using 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and 4) outcome assessments at 3 and 6 months. We describe how the infrastructure was established for building data repositories for clinical data, plasma biomarkers, genetics, neuroimaging, and multidimensional outcome measures to create a high quality and accessible information commons for TBI research. Risk factors for poor follow-up, TBI-CDE limitations, and implementation strategies are described. Having demonstrated the feasibility of implementing the TBI-CDEs through successful recruitment and multidimensional data collection, we aim to expand to additional study sites. Furthermore, interested researchers will be provided early access to the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) data set for collaborative opportunities to more precisely characterize TBI and improve the design of future clinical treatment trials.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: In ventilated children, to determine the prevalence of hyperglycemia, establish whether it is associated with organ failure, and document glycemic control practices in Australasian pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). DESIGN: Prospective inception cohort study. SETTING: All nine specialist PICUs in Australia and New Zealand. PATIENTS: Children ventilated > 12 hrs excluding those with diabetic ketoacidosis, on home ventilation, undergoing active cardiopulmonary resuscitation on admission, or with do-not-resuscitate orders. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All blood glucose measurements for up to 14 days, clinical and laboratory values needed to calculate Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) scores, and insulin use were recorded in 409 patients. Fifty percent of glucose measurements were > 6.1 mmol/L, with 89% of patients having peak values > 6.1 mmol/L. The median time to peak blood glucose was 7 hrs. Hyperglycemia was defined by area under the glucose-time curve > 6.1 mmol/L above the sample median. Thirteen percent of hyperglycemic subjects died vs. 3% of nonhyperglycemic subjects. There was an independent association between hyperglycemia and a PELOD score > or = 10 (odds ratio 3.41, 95% confidence interval 1.91-6.10) and death (odds ratio 3.31, 95% confidence interval 1.26-7.7). Early hyperglycemia, defined using only glucose data in the first 48 hrs, was also associated with these outcomes but not with PELOD > or = 10 after day 2 or with worsening PELOD after day 1. Five percent of patients received insulin. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia is common in PICUs, occurs early, and is independently associated with organ failure and death. However, early hyperglycemia is not associated with later or worsening organ failure. Australasian PICUs seldom use insulin.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The last multicentered analysis of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in pediatric acute respiratory failure was completed in 1993. We reviewed recent international data to evaluate survival and predictors of mortality. DESIGN: Retrospective case series review. SETTING: The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry, which includes data voluntarily submitted from over 115 centers worldwide, was queried. The work was completed at the Division of Pediatric Critical Care, Department of Pediatrics, Primary Children's Medical Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT. SUBJECTS: Patients aged 1 month to 18 yrs supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory failure from 1993 to 2007. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 3,213 children studied. Overall survival remained relatively unchanged over time at 57%. Considerable variability in survival was found based on pulmonary diagnosis, ranging from 83% for status asthmaticus to 39% for pertussis. Comorbidities significantly decreased survival to 33% for those with renal failure (n = 329), 16% with liver failure (n = 51), and 5% with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (n = 22). The proportion of patients with comorbidities increased from 19% during 1993 to 47% in 2007. Clinical factors associated with mortality included precannulation ventilatory support longer than 2 wks and lower precannulation blood pH. CONCLUSIONS: Although the survival of pediatric patients with acute respiratory failure treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has not changed, this treatment is currently offered to increasingly medically complex patients. Mechanical ventilation in excess of 2 wks before the initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is associated with decreased survival.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe the frequency, physiologic effects, safety, and patient outcomes associated with traditional rehabilitation therapy in patients who require mechanical ventilation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective observational report of consecutive patients ventilated 4 or more days and eligible for rehabilitation in a single medical intensive care unit (ICU) during a 13-week period was conducted. RESULTS: Of the 32 patients who met the inclusion criteria, only 21 (66%) received physician orders for evaluation by rehabilitation services (physical and/or occupational therapy). Fifty rehabilitation treatments were provided to 19 patients on a median of 12% of medical ICU days per patient, with deep sedation and unavailability of rehabilitation staff representing major barriers to treatment. Physiologic changes during rehabilitation therapy were minimal. Joint contractures were frequent in the lower extremities and did not improve during hospitalization. In 53% and 79% of initial ICU assessments, muscle weakness was present in upper and lower extremities, respectively, with a decreased prevalence of 19% and 43% at hospital discharge, respectively. New impairments in physical function were common at hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot project illustrated important barriers to providing rehabilitation to mechanically ventilated patients in an ICU and impairments in strength, range of motion, and functional outcomes at hospital discharge.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the most common filamentous fungal infection observed in immunocompromised patients. The incidence of invasive aspergillosis has increased significantly in recent decades in parallel with the increasing number and improved survival of immunocompromised patients. IA in adults has been well characterized; however, only a few small studies of IA in children have been reported. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the incidence and outcomes of children with IA. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using the 2000 Kids Inpatient Database, a national database of hospital inpatient stays during 2000. IA was defined as aspergillosis that occurred in a child with malignancy (solid tumor, leukemia, or lymphoma), hematologic/immunologic deficiency, or transplant (bone marrow or solid organ). Discharge weighting was applied to the data to obtain nationally representative estimates of disease. RESULTS: During 2000, there were an estimated 666 pediatric cases of IA among 152,231 immunocompromised children, yielding an annual incidence of 437/100,000 (0.4%) among hospitalized immunocompromised children. Children with malignancy accounted for the majority (74%) of cases of IA. The highest incidence of IA was seen in children who had undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (4.5%) and those with acute myelogenous leukemia (4%). The overall in-hospital mortality of immunocompromised children with IA was 18%. Children with malignancy and IA were at higher risk for death than children with malignancy and without IA. Pediatric patients with IA had a significantly longer median length of hospital stay (16 days) than immunocompromised children without IA (3 days). The median total hospital charges for patients with IA were $49309 compared with immunocompromised children without IA ($9035). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of IA on increases in mortality, length of hospital stay, and the burden of cost in the hospital setting underscores the need for improved means of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of IA in immunocompromised children.},

Psychiatric diagnoses, including anxiety and acute stress, depressive, substance use, and disruptive behavior disorders, given to these youths over the next three years (2002-2004) were documented, as were psychotropic medication prescriptions. Regression analyses assessed for an independent association between injury and psychiatric disorders and prescription of psychotropic medication.In adjusted regression analyses, injury in the index year was independently associated with significantly increased odds of receiving a diagnosis of anxiety or acute stress (odds ratio [OR]=1.21, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.02-1.44), depression (OR=1.30, CI=1.10-1.53), and a substance use disorder (OR=1.56, CI=1.21-2.00) and of receiving a psychotropic medication prescription (OR=1.37, CI=1.20-1.57). Youths with traumatic brain injuries also were significantly more likely to receive psychotropic medication prescriptions.Traumatic injury was independently associated with an increased risk of receiving a full spectrum of anxiety, depressive, and substance use diagnoses among youths aged ten to 19. Population-based surveillance procedures that incorporate screening and stepped-care interventions targeting the spectrum of postinjury emotional disturbances have the potential to improve the quality of mental health care for youths treated in general medical settings.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in children. Guidelines have been established to prevent secondary brain injury caused by hypotension or hypoxia. The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence, monitoring, and treatment of hypotension and hypoxia during "early" (prehospital and emergency department) care and to evaluate their relationship to vital status and neurologic outcomes at hospital discharge. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 299 children with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury presenting to a level 1 pediatric trauma center. We recorded vital signs and medical provider response to hypotension and/or hypoxia during all portions of early care. RESULTS: Blood pressure (31%) and oxygenation (34%) were not recorded during some portion of "early care." Documented hypotension occurred in 118 children (39%). An attempt to treat documented hypotension was made in 48% (57 of 118 children). After adjusting for severity of illness, children who did not receive an attempt to treat hypotension had an increased odds of death of 3.4 and were 3.7 times more likely to suffer disability compared with treated hypotensive children. Documented hypoxia occurred in 131 children (44%). An attempt to treat hypoxia was made in 92% (121 of 131 children). Untreated hypoxia was not significantly associated with death or disability, except in the setting of hypotension. CONCLUSIONS: Hypotension and hypoxia are common events in pediatric traumatic brain injury. Approximately one third of children are not properly monitored in the early phases of their management. Attempts to treat hypotension and hypoxia significantly improved outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Poor outcomes in systemic juvenile arthritis have been associated with persistent thrombocytosis, increased sedimentation rates, anemia, polyarthritis, and prolonged steroid use. Off-label treatment with recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist therapy (anakinra) has become more common since reports of its association with reduced systemic symptoms and arthritis scores, improved laboratory parameters of inflammation, and decreased corticosteroid requirements. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and safety of anakinra in a regional cohort of systemic juvenile arthritis patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of systemic juvenile arthritis patients (n = 33) treated with anakinra at 3 Pediatric Rheumatology centers. The effect of anakinra on corticosteroid dose, sedimentation rate, platelet count, albumin, hemoglobin, arthritis joint counts, and height Z score was determined using the paired t test. We evaluated differences in change in these variables between patient groups within the sample determined by: age of onset, anakinra dose, and duration from diagnosis until anakinra treatment. RESULTS: Treatment was associated with decreases in corticosteroid dosage and sedimentation rate and increases in hemoglobin and albumin (P < 0.02). There were decreases in large joint arthritis counts (P < 0.04) but not small joint counts after 3 to 4 months. There were greater decreases in sedimentation rates from pre to post (1-2 months) in patients on high versus low dose anakinra (P < 0.001). Fever and rash, present in 7 cases before treatment, was resolved. Eight patients had periods of arthritis, 1 developed macrophage activation syndrome, and another Epstein Barr virus. Over half of patients reported localized pain or swelling at their injection site. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anakinra was associated with short-term improvements in large joint counts and laboratory parameters of active disease. Higher anakinra doses may be more efficacious in treating the systemic inflammatory response in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients. A subset of patients had periods of arthritis during treatment, and local side-effects were frequent. Our experience supports the continued use of interleukin-1 inhibition in systemic juvenile arthritis and the search for more effective and more tolerable forms of interleukin-1 inhibition.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Inhalation of fine particulate matter, including particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a 2.5-microm cut point (PM2.5), has been associated with systemic inflammation and the clinical presentation of various cardiopulmonary heath events. The urban area along Utah's Wasatch Mountains has high PM2.5 concentrations during periods of stagnant air conditions. Short-term inhalation exposures may trigger inflammatory events presenting as symptom onset in new patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). This study evaluated potential associations between JIA symptom onset and temporal changes in regional air pollution measured by stagnant air conditions and PM2.5 concentrations. METHODS: A case-crossover design was used to analyze associations of regional ambient PM2.5 concentrations with onset date of 338 JIA cases living on Utah's Wasatch Front. Patients were drawn from the Intermountain States Database of Childhood Rheumatic Diseases (1993-2006). Time trends, seasonality, month, and weekday were controlled for by matching. Selected exposure windows of PM2.5 and stagnant air days were used in the model to determine the effect of short term cumulative exposure on JIA symptom onset. RESULTS: Increased concentrations of PM2.5 and stagnant air conditions in the preceding 14 days were associated with significantly elevated risk of JIA onset in preschool aged children (RR=1.60, 95% CI 1.00-2.54) but not older children. Elevated risk was larger in males and in systemic onset JIA. CONCLUSION: Exposure to stagnant polluted air may be an environmental risk factor for JIA in young children, potentially triggered by pollution-induced pulmonary mediated inflammation.},

  Abstract                 = {Longitudinal data sets are comprised of repeated observations of an outcome and a set of covariates for each of many subjects. One objective of statistical analysis is to describe the marginal expectation of the outcome variable as a function of the covariates while accounting for the correlation among the repeated observations for a given subject. This paper proposes a unifying approach to such analysis for a variety of discrete and continuous outcomes. A class of generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for the regression parameters is proposed. The equations are extensions of those used in quasi-likelihood (Wedderburn, 1974, Biometrika 61, 439-447) methods. The GEEs have solutions which are consistent and asymptotically Gaussian even when the time dependence is misspecified as we often expect. A consistent variance estimate is presented. We illustrate the use of the GEE approach with longitudinal data from a study of the effect of mothers' stress on children's morbidity.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether analgesic and sedative drug use during PICU treatment is associated with long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in children who survived meningococcal septic shock. DESIGN: This study concerned a secondary analysis of data from medical and psychological follow-up of a cross-sectional cohort of all consecutive surviving patients with septic shock and purpura requiring intensive care treatment between 1988 and 2001 at the Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital. At least 4 years after PICU admission, these children showed impairments on several domains of neuropsychological functioning. In the present study, type, number, and dose of sedatives and analgesics were retrospectively evaluated. SETTING: Tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS: Seventy-seven meningococcal septic shock survivors (median age, 2.1 yr). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five patients (58%) received one or more analgesic and/or sedative drugs during PICU admission, most commonly benzodiazepines (n = 39; 51%), followed by opioids (n = 23; 30%). In total, 12 different kinds of analgesic or sedative drugs were given. The use and dose of opioids were significantly associated with poor test outcome on full-scale intelligence quotient (p = 0.02; Z = -2.28), verbal intelligence quotient (p = 0.02; Z = -2.32), verbal intelligence quotient subtests (verbal comprehension [p = 0.01; Z = -2.56] and vocabulary [p = 0.01; Z = -2.45]), and visual attention/executive functioning (Trial Making Test part B) (p = 0.03; Z = -2.17). In multivariate analysis adjusting for patient and disease characteristics, the use of opioids remained significant on most neuropsychological tests. CONCLUSIONS: The use of opioids during PICU admission was significantly associated with long-term adverse neuropsychological outcome independent of severity of illness scores in meningococcal septic shock survivors.},

  Abstract                 = {Psychological quality of life (QOL), health-related QOL (HRQOL), and life satisfaction outcomes and their associated risk factors are reviewed for the large cohort of survivors and siblings in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). This review includes previously published manuscripts that used CCSS data focused on psychological outcome measures, including the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Cantril Ladder of Life, and other self-report questionnaires. Comparisons and contrasts are made between siblings and survivors, and to normative data when available, in light of demographic/health information and abstracted data from the medical record. These studies demonstrate that a significant proportion of survivors report more symptoms of global distress and poorer physical, but not emotional, domains of HRQOL. Other than brain tumor survivors, most survivors report both good present and expected future life satisfaction. Risk factors for psychological distress and poor HRQOL are female sex, lower educational attainment, unmarried status, annual household income less than $20,000, unemployment, lack of health insurance, presence of a major medical condition, and treatment with cranial radiation and/or surgery. Cranial irradiation impacted neurocognitive outcomes, especially in brain tumor survivors. Psychological distress also predicted poor health behaviors, including smoking, alcohol use, fatigue, and altered sleep. Psychological distress and pain predicted use of complementary and alternative medicine. Overall, most survivors are psychologically healthy and report satisfaction with their lives. However, certain groups of childhood cancer survivors are at high risk for psychological distress, neurocognitive dysfunction, and poor HRQOL, especially in physical domains. These findings suggest targeting interventions for groups at highest risk for adverse outcomes and examining the positive growth that remains despite the trauma of childhood cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: We performed this study to determine the frequency of previous hospitalization among children hospitalized with influenza. METHODS: The Pediatric Health Information System database (discharges that occurred between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2006) was used to determine the proportion of children hospitalized with influenza or respiratory illness who had a previous hospitalization during the most recent influenza-vaccination season. Subjects included pediatric patients (through 18 years of age). The index hospitalization was defined as the first influenza or respiratory illness hospitalization for a child that occurred during the study period and between November 1 and April 30. A previous hospitalization during the most recent influenza-vaccination season was defined as a hospitalization for any reason in the 0.5 to 6 months before the index hospitalization but not before September 1 or on or after March 1. RESULTS: Overall, 16% of children hospitalized with influenza and 12% of children hospitalized with influenza or a respiratory illness had a previous hospitalization during the most recent influenza-vaccination season. Approximately 23% of the children hospitalized with influenza and a comorbidity had a previous hospitalization during the most recent influenza-vaccination season. CONCLUSION: Hospital-based programs for influenza vaccination have the potential to reach children at highest risk of influenza complications and to reduce the rates of pediatric hospitalization for treatment of influenza-related illness.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors compared five methods of studying survival bias associated with time-to-treatment initiation in a drug effectiveness study using medical administrative databases (1996-2002) from Quebec, Canada. The first two methods illustrated how survival bias could be introduced. Three additional methods were considered to control for this bias. Methods were compared in the context of evaluating statins for secondary prevention in elderly patients post-acute myocardial infarction who initiated statins within 90 days after discharge and those who did not. Method 1 that classified patients into users and nonusers at discharge resulted in an overestimation of the benefit (38% relative risk reduction at 1 year). In method 2, following users from the time of the first prescription and nonusers from a randomly selected time between 0 and 90 days attenuated the effect toward the null (10% relative risk reduction). Method 3 controlled for survival bias by following patients from the end of the 90-day time window; however, it suffered a major loss of statistical efficiency and precision. Method 4 matched prescription time distribution between users and nonusers at cohort entry. Method 5 used a time-dependent variable for treatment initiation. Methods 4 and 5 better controlled for survival bias and yielded similar results, suggesting a 20% risk reduction of recurrent myocardial infarction or death events.},

SETTING: The US during 2000 through 2004. SUBJECTS: Drivers (10,427) and rear seat passengers (15,922) in passenger vehicles that crashed and had at least one driver or rear passenger death. Data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The adjusted relative risk (aRR) of death for a belted rear seat passenger compared with an otherwise similar unbelted rear passenger. RESULTS: Safety belt use was associated with a reduced risk of death for rear car occupants: outboard rear seat aRR 0.42 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.46), and center rear seat aRR 0.30 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.44). For rear occupants of light trucks, vans, and utility vehicles, the estimates were: outboard aRR 0.25 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.29), center aRR 0.34 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.48). CONCLUSIONS: If the authors' estimates are causal, traffic crash mortality can be reduced for rear occupants by approximately 55-75% if they use safety belts.},

DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: US hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Children younger than 1 year with a discharge diagnosis of intussusception identified in the Kids' Inpatient Database, a series of nationally representative data sets of pediatric hospital discharges in the United States with 4 available years prior to vaccine reintroduction (1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006) and 1 year after (2009). MAIN EXPOSURES: Hospital discharge before vs after rotavirus vaccine reintroduction. OUTCOME MEASURES: Total number and rate of hospital discharges for infants younger than 1 year with a diagnosis of intussusception (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 560.0). RESULTS: From 1997 to 2006, there was no change in the total number of hospital discharges for intussusception, with a small decrease in the rate of intussusception discharges (41.6 [95% CI, 36.7-46.5] to 36.5 [95% CI, 31.7-41.2] per 100,000 infants). Based on the trend, the predicted rate of discharges for intussusception in 2009 was 36.0 (95% CI, 30.2-41.8) per 100,000 infants. The measured rate of hospital discharges for intussusception in 2009 was 33.3 (95% CI, 29.0-37.6) per 100,000 infants. CONCLUSION: The reintroduction of rotavirus vaccine since 2006 has not resulted in a detectable increase in the number of hospital discharges for intussusception among US infants.},

  Abstract                 = {Density is a salient property of bone and plays a crucial role in determining the mechanical properties of both its cancellous and cortical structural forms. Density is defined in a number of ways at either the bone tissue (D(app), apparent) or the bone material level (D(mat), material). The concept of density is relatively simple, but measuring it in the context of bone is a complex issue. The third dimension of the problem is the concept of porosity, or BV/TV (ratio of bone material volume over tissue volume). Recent investigations from our laboratory have revealed an interdependence of D(app) and D(mat) in the cancellous bone of at least four different cohorts of human patients. To clarify the underlying causes of this behaviour, we produced here equivalent relationships from specimens originating from cortical and cancellous areas of the same bone. Plots of D(app) vs. D(mat) showed that D(mat) was not a monotonic function of increasing D(app), but instead showed a 'boomerang'-like pattern. By empirically dissecting the data in two regions for D(app) above and below a value equal to 1.3gcm(-3), we were able to objectively isolate the bone in trabecular and compact forms. Our findings may have implications not only for the segregation of bone in these two structural forms, but also for the mechanobiological and physiological processes that govern the regulation of compact and trabecular bone areas.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between weight and the risk of injury in motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) for children 1 through 8 years of age who were using child restraints. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of children 1 to 8 years of age in MVCs, in which cases from the National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System were used. Abbreviated Injury Scale scores of >/=2 indicated clinically significant injuries. RESULTS: The National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System study sample included 650 children 1 to 5 years of age in forward-facing child restraints who weighed 20 to 65 lb and 344 children 3 to 8 years of age in belt-positioning booster seats who weighed 30 to 100 lb. With adjustment for seating position, type of vehicle, direction of impact, crash severity, and vehicle model year, there was no association between absolute weight and clinically significant injuries in either age group (odds ratio: 1.17 [95% confidence interval: 0.96-1.42] for children 1-5 years of age in forward-facing child restraints and 1.22 [95% confidence interval: 0.96-1.55] for children 3-8 years of age in belt-positioning booster seats). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of clinically significant injuries was not associated with weight across a broad weight range in this sample of children in MVCs who were using child restraint systems. Parents should continue to restrain their children according to current recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: While physicians provide discharge instructions to patients and families following emergency department (ED) visits, injury prevention information may not be routinely included in these instructions. This study assessed emergency physicians' knowledge and provision of child passenger safety (CPS) information to patients following motor vehicle crashes (MVCs). METHODS: This study was both a survey of emergency physician knowledge and provision of CPS information and an examination of frequency of CPS information in discharge instructions at a single institution. Members of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Emergency Medicine were invited to participate in the survey. Respondents were asked about their provision of CPS information to patients and knowledge of national AAP CPS recommendations. The institutional ED medical record chart review assessed the frequency of written CPS information for patients of MVC-related visits who were discharged home. RESULTS: There were 317 survey respondents from 1,024 eligible physicians, of whom 43 began but did not complete the survey. The data analyzed are from the 274 who completed the survey. While 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 81% to 89%) of physicians believed that CPS information should be included in discharge instructions, only 36% (95% CI = 31% to 42%) correctly answered all knowledge questions. Of the 51 self-identified division/department chiefs, 15 (29.4%; 95% CI = 16.9% to 41.9%) reported that their EDs routinely provide CPS information in discharge instructions for pediatric passengers in MVCs. For the medical record review, of the 152 randomly selected MVC visits, 13 (8.6%; 95% CI = 4.1% to 13.0%) had documented CPS information in the discharge instructions. Patients with documented CPS information were younger, but there were no significant differences in race, sex, or maximum abbreviated injury scale score between patients with versus without CPS information. CONCLUSIONS: While emergency physicians value the use of CPS information in discharge instructions following MVCs, they do not have adequate knowledge of, nor do they regularly disseminate, this information.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To develop evidence-based and expert-driven quality indicators for measuring variations in the structure and organization of acute inpatient rehabilitation for children after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to survey centers across the United States to determine the degree of variation in care. DESIGN: Quality indicators were developed using the RAND/UCLA modified Delphi method. Adherence to these indicators was determined from a survey of rehabilitation facilities. SETTING: Inpatient rehabilitation units in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of rehabilitation programs identified using data from the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation, and the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities yielded 74 inpatient units treating children with TBI. Survey respondents comprised 31 pediatric and 28 all age units. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Variations in structure and organization of care among institutions providing acute inpatient rehabilitation for children with TBI. RESULTS: Twelve indicators were developed. Pediatric inpatient rehabilitation units and units with higher volumes of children with TBI were more likely to have: a census of at least 1 child admitted with a TBI for at least 90% of the time; adequate specialized equipment; a classroom; a pediatric subspecialty trained medical director; and more than 75% of therapists with pediatric training. CONCLUSIONS: There were clinically and statistically significant variations in the structure and organization of acute pediatric rehabilitation based on the pediatric focus of the unit and volume of children with TBI.},

Guidelines: In children who have experienced trauma and are alert, conversant, have no neurological deficit, no midline cervical tenderness, and no painful distracting injury, and are not intoxicated, cervical spine x-rays are not necessary to exclude cervical spine injury and are not recommended. In children who have experienced trauma and who are either not alert, nonconversant, or have neurological deficit, midline cervical tenderness, or painful distracting injury, or are intoxicated, it is recommended that anteroposterior and lateral cervical spine x-rays be obtained. Options: In children younger than age 9 years who have experienced trauma, and who are nonconversant or have an altered mental status, a neurological deficit, neck pain, or a painful distracting injury, are intoxicated, or have unexplained hypotension, it is recommended that anteroposterior and lateral cervical spine x-rays be obtained. In children age 9 years or older who have experienced trauma, and who are nonconversant or have an altered mental status, a neurological deficit, neck pain, or a painful distracting injury, are intoxicated, or have unexplained hypotension, it is recommended that anteroposterior, lateral, and open-mouth cervical spine x-rays be obtained. Computed tomographic scanning with attention to the suspected level of neurological injury to exclude occult fractures or to evaluate regions not seen adequately on plain x-rays is recommended. Flexion/extension cervical x-rays or fluoroscopy may be considered to exclude gross ligamentous instability when there remains a suspicion of cervical spine instability after static x-rays are obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine may be considered to exclude cord or nerve root compression, evaluate ligamentous integrity, or provide information regarding neurological prognosis. TREATMENT: Standards: There is insufficient evidence to support treatment standards. Guidelines: There is insufficient evidence to support treatment guidelines. Options: Thoracic elevation or an occipital recess to prevent flexion of the head and neck when restrained supine on an otherwise flat backboard may allow for better neutral alignment and immobilization of the cervical spine in children younger than 8 years because of the relatively large head in these younger children and is recommended. Closed reduction and halo immobilization for injuries of the C2 synchondrosis between the body and odontoid is recommended in children younger than 7 years. Consideration of primary operative therapy is recommended for isolated ligamentous injuries of the cervical spine with associated deformity.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Traditional approaches to mechanical ventilation use tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml per kilogram of body weight and may cause stretch-induced lung injury in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. We therefore conducted a trial to determine whether ventilation with lower tidal volumes would improve the clinical outcomes in these patients. METHODS: Patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized trial. The trial compared traditional ventilation treatment, which involved an initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau pressure) of 50 cm of water or less, with ventilation with a lower tidal volume, which involved an initial tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of water or less. The primary outcomes were death before a patient was discharged home and was breathing without assistance and the number of days without ventilator use from day 1 to day 28. RESULTS: The trial was stopped after the enrollment of 861 patients because mortality was lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (31.0 percent vs. 39.8 percent, P=0.007), and the number of days without ventilator use during the first 28 days after randomization was greater in this group (mean [+/-SD], 12+/-11 vs. 10+/-11; P=0.007). The mean tidal volumes on days 1 to 3 were 6.2+/-0.8 and 11.8+/-0.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (P<0.001), respectively, and the mean plateau pressures were 25+/-6 and 33+/-8 cm of water (P<0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation with a lower tidal volume than is traditionally used results in decreased mortality and increases the number of days without ventilator use.},
