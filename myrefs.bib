  Abstract                 = {The purposes of this study, in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI), to describe cervical spine imaging practice, to assess for recent changes in imaging practice, and to determine whether cervical spine computed tomography (CT) is being used in children at low risk for cervical spine injury.The setting was children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database, from January 2001 to June 2011. Participants were children (younger than 18 y) with TBI who were evaluated in the emergency department, admitted to the hospital, and received a head CT scan on the day of admission. The primary outcome measures were cervical spine imaging studies. This study was exempted from institutional review board assessment.A total of 30,112 children met study criteria. Overall, 52\% (15,687/30,112) received cervical spine imaging. The use of cervical spine radiographs alone decreased between 2001 (47\%) and 2011 (23\%), with an annual decrease of 2.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.1\%-3.3\%), and was largely replaced by an increased use of CT, with or without radiographs (8.6\% in 2001 and 19.5\% in 2011, with an annual increase of 0.9\%; 95\% CI, 0.1\%-1.8\%). A total of 2545 children received cervical spine CT despite being discharged alive from the hospital in less than 72 hours, and 1655 of those had a low-risk mechanism of injury.The adoption of CT clearance of the cervical spine in adults seems to have influenced the care of children with TBI, despite concerns about radiation exposure.},

  Abstract                 = {Record linkage may create powerful datasets with which investigators can conduct comparative effectiveness studies evaluating the impact of tests or interventions on health. All linkages of health care data files to date have used protected health information (PHI) in their linkage variables. A technique to link datasets without using PHI would be advantageous both to preserve privacy and to increase the number of potential linkages.We applied probabilistic linkage to records of injured children in the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB, N = 156,357) and the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS, N = 104,049) databases from 2007 to 2010. 49 match variables without PHI were used, many of them administrative variables and indicators for procedures recorded as International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification codes. We validated the accuracy of the linkage using identified data from a single center that submits to both databases.We accurately linked the PHIS and NTDB records for 69\% of children with any injury, and 88\% of those with severe traumatic brain injury eligible for a study of intervention effectiveness (positive predictive value of 98\%, specificity of 99.99\%). Accurate linkage was associated with longer lengths of stay, more severe injuries, and multiple injuries.In populations with substantial illness or injury severity, accurate record linkage may be possible in the absence of PHI. This methodology may enable linkages and, in turn, comparative effectiveness studies that would be unlikely or impossible otherwise.},

  Abstract                 = {To describe patient demographics, interventions, and outcomes in hospitalized children with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) complicating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).We performed a retrospective cohort study using data recorded in the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database from October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2010. Participants had International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes for MAS and either SLE or JIA. The primary outcome was hospital mortality (for the index admission). Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admission, critical care interventions, and medication use.A total of 121 children at 28 children's hospitals met the inclusion criteria, including 19 children with SLE and 102 children with JIA. The index admission mortality rate was 7\% (8 of 121 patients). ICU admission (33\%), mechanical ventilation (26\%), and inotrope/vasopressor therapy (26\%) were common. Compared to children with JIA, those with SLE had a similar mortality rate (6\% versus 11\%, respectively; exact P = 0.6). More patients with SLE than those with JIA received ICU care (63\% versus 27\%; P = 0.002), received mechanical ventilation (53\% versus 21\%; P = 0.003), and had cardiovascular dysfunction (47\% versus 23\% received inotrope/vasopressor therapy; P = 0.02). Children with SLE and those with JIA received cyclosporine at similar rates, but more children with SLE received cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil, and more children with JIA received interleukin-1 antagonists.Organ system dysfunction is common in children with rheumatic diseases complicated by MAS, and more organ system support is required in children with underlying SLE than in children with JIA. Current treatment of pediatric MAS varies based on the underlying rheumatic disease.},

MAIN ANALYSIS: Cox regression.The predictor of interest was the patient-specific peak serum ferritin level, dichotomized a priori at 3000 ng/mL. The outcomes were mortality and intensive care unit admission. A total of 171 patients met the inclusion criteria. The observation time without death or intensive care unit admission ranged from 184 to 1621 days. The hazard ratio of death with peak ferritin of >3000 ng/mL was 4.32 (95\% confidence interval 2.21-8.47, p < .001) compared to peak ferritin of 1000-3000 ng/mL. The hazard ratio of intensive care unit admission with peak ferritin of >3000 ng/mL was 2.49 (95\% confidence interval 1.53-4.05, p < .001) compared to peak ferritin of 1000-3000 ng/mL. Both estimates were adjusted for bone marrow transplant, solid organ transplant, hemoglobinopathy, and existing rheumatologic disease.In this pediatric population, with serum ferritin levels of >3000 ng/mL, there was increased risk for both receipt of critical care and subsequent death.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The mechanism, crash characteristics, and spectrum of lower extremity injuries in children restrained in forward-facing car seats during front and rear impacts have not been described. METHODS: We identified in two databases children who sustained lower extremity injuries while restrained in forward-facing car seats. To identify the mechanism, we analyzed crash reconstructions from three frontal-impact cases from the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network. To further describe the crash and injury characteristics we evaluated children between 1 and 4 years of age with lower extremity injuries from front or rear impacts in the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) database. RESULTS: Crash reconstruction data demonstrated that the likely mechanism of lower extremity injury was contact between the legs and the front seatbacks. In the CDS database, we identified 15 children with lower extremity injuries in a forward-facing child seat, usually (13 out of 15) placed in the rear seat, incurred in frontal impacts (11 out of 15). Several (5 out of 15) children were in unbelted or improperly secured forward-facing car seats. Injury Severity Scores varied widely (5-50). CONCLUSIONS: Children in forward-facing car seats involved in severe front or rear crashes may incur a range of lower extremity injury from impact with the car interior component in front of them. Crash scene photography can provide useful information about anatomic sites at risk for injury and alert emergency department providers to possible subtle injury.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to determine the effect of birth hospital pediatric cardiac specialty center status and neonatal level of care on 90-day mortality for infants with ductal-dependent congenital heart disease. METHODS: A population-based, retrospective, cohort study was conducted in Washington State in 1987-2006. All infants born in Washington with gestational ages of >/=32 weeks and birth weights of >/=1500 g who were admitted to a Washington hospital for the care of a congenital cardiac anomaly likely to be ductal dependent were included. Subjects were required to receive a surgical or interventional cardiac procedure within 30 days after birth. Birth certificate data were linked with death certificate data and hospital administrative records. The exposures of interest were birth hospital pediatric cardiac specialty center status and neonatal level of care. The primary outcome was death within 90 days. RESULTS: A total of 823 infants met the inclusion criteria, 285 born at specialty centers and 538 at other centers. After adjustment for cardiac diagnoses, other congenital anomalies, birth year, maternal income quartile, and definitive-care hospital, there was no significant difference in 90-day mortality for infants born at specialty centers versus other centers (odds ratio: 1.05 [95% confidence interval: 0.65-1.68]). CONCLUSION: For infants with ductal-dependent congenital heart disease, there was no difference in 90-day mortality for infants born at specialty centers versus other centers in the state of Washington.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: (1) To determine factors associated with physical therapy (PT) or occupational therapy (OT) evaluation and speech or swallow therapy evaluation in hospitalized children with traumatic brain injury (TBI); (2) to describe when during the hospital stay the initial therapy evaluations typically occur; and (3) to quantify any between-hospital variation in therapy evaluation. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database (January 2001-June 2011). PARTICIPANTS: Children (age <18y) with TBI (N=21,399) who were admitted to the intensive care unit and survived to hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PT or OT evaluation and speech or swallow therapy evaluation. A propensity score was calculated to allow comparison of expected with observed rates of therapy evaluations by the hospital. RESULTS: The median hospital length of stay was 5 days (interquartile range, 3-10d). Overall, 8748 (41%) of 21,399 children received either a PT or OT evaluation, and 5490 (26%) out of 21,399 children received either a speech or swallow evaluation. Older children and those with higher energy injury mechanisms, more severe injuries, extremity fractures, more treatment with neuromuscular blocking agents or pentobarbital, and admission to a hospital with an American College of Surgeons Level I pediatric trauma designation were more likely to receive therapy evaluations. The median time until the first therapy evaluation was 5 (PT or OT) and 7 days (speech or swallow). Expected hospital evaluation rates were 25% to 54% (PT or OT) and 16% to 35% (speech or swallow), while observed hospital evaluation rates were 11% to 74% (PT or OT) and 4% to 55% (speech or swallow). CONCLUSIONS: There is wide between-hospital variation in provision of rehabilitation therapies for children with TBI. Evidence-based criteria for initiation of routine therapy evaluations after TBI are needed.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To describe between-hospital and patient-level variation in intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and to evaluate ICP monitoring in association with hospital features and outcome in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database (January 2001 to June 2011). PARTICIPANTS: Children (aged <18 years) with TBI and head Abbreviated Injury Scale scores of at least 3 who were ventilated for at least 96 consecutive hours or who died in the first 4 days after hospital admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Monitoring of ICP. RESULTS: A total of 4667 children met the study criteria. Hospital mortality was 41% (n = 1919). Overall, 55% of patients (n = 2586) received ICP monitoring. Expected hospital ICP monitoring rates after adjustment for patient age, cardiac arrest, inflicted injury, craniotomy or craniectomy, head Abbreviated Injury Scale score, and Injury Severity Score were 47% to 60%. Observed hospital ICP monitoring rates were 14% to 83%. Hospitals with more observed ICP monitoring, relative to expected, and hospitals with higher patient volumes had lower rates of mortality or severe disability. After adjustment for between-hospital variation and patient severity of injury, ICP monitoring was independently associated with age 1 year and older (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.5-3.8) vs age younger than 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: There was significant between-hospital variation in ICP monitoring that cannot be attributed solely to differences in case mix. Hospitals that monitor ICP more frequently and hospitals with higher patient volumes had better patient outcomes. Infants with TBI are less likely to receive ICP monitoring than are older children.},

  Abstract                 = {Our objectives were to review and categorize the existing data sources that are important to pediatric critical care medicine (PCCM) investigators and the types of questions that have been or could be studied with each data source. We conducted a narrative review of the medical literature, categorized the data sources available to PCCM investigators, and created an online data source registry. We found that many data sources are available for research in PCCM. To date, PCCM investigators have most often relied on pediatric critical care registries and treatment- or disease-specific registries. The available data sources vary widely in the level of clinical detail and the types of questions they can reliably answer. Linkage of data sources can expand the types of questions that a data source can be used to study. Careful matching of the scientific question to the best available data source or linked data sources is necessary. In addition, rigorous application of the best available analysis techniques and reporting consistent with observational research standards will maximize the quality of research using existing data in PCCM.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To describe patterns of use for mannitol and hypertonic saline in children with traumatic brain injury, to evaluate any potential associations between hypertonic saline and mannitol use and patient demographic, injury, and treatment hospital characteristics, and to determine whether the 2003 guidelines for severe pediatric traumatic brain injury impacted clinical practice regarding osmolar therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Pediatric Health Information System database, January, 2001 to December, 2008. PATIENTS: Children (age <18 yrs) with traumatic brain injury and head/neck Abbreviated Injury Scale score >/= 3 who received mechanical ventilation and intensive care. INTERVENTIONS: : None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was hospital billing for parenteral hypertonic saline and mannitol use, by day of service. Overall, 33% (2,069 of 6,238) of the patients received hypertonic saline, and 40% (2,500 of 6,238) received mannitol. Of the 1,854 patients who received hypertonic saline or mannitol for >/= 2 days in the first week of therapy, 29% did not have intracranial pressure monitoring. After adjustment for hospital-level variation, primary insurance payer, and overall injury severity, use of both drugs was independently associated with older patient age, intracranial hemorrhage (other than epidural), skull fracture, and higher head/neck injury severity. Hypertonic saline use increased and mannitol use decreased with publication of the 2003 guidelines, and these trends continued through 2008. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertonic saline and mannitol are used less in infants than in older children. The patient-level and hospital-level variation in osmolar therapy use and the substantial amount of sustained osmolar therapy without intracranial pressure monitoring suggest opportunities to improve the quality of pediatric traumatic brain injury care. With limited high-quality evidence available, published expert guidelines appear to significantly impact clinical practice in this area.},

We assessed the ventilator-associated events algorithm in pediatric patients.A retrospective observational cohort study.This single-center study took place in a PICU at an urban academic medical facility.Pediatric (ages 0-18 yr old) trauma patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury ventilated for greater than or equal to 2 days.We assessed for pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia (as defined by current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PNU2 guidelines), adult ventilator-associated events, and an experimental ventilator-associated events definition modified for pediatric patients. We compared ventilator-associated events to ventilator-associated pneumonia to calculate the test characteristics. Thirty-nine of 119 patients (33\%) developed ventilator-associated pneumonia. Sensitivity of the adult ventilator-associated condition definition was 23\% (95\% CI, 11-39\%), which increased to 56\% (95\% CI, 40-72\%) using the modified pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia criterion. Specificity reached 100\% for both original and modified pediatric probable ventilator-associated pneumonia using ventilator-associated events criteria. Children who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia or ventilator-associated condition had similar baseline characteristics: age, mechanism of injury, injury severity scores, and use of an intracranial pressure monitor. Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated condition portended similarly unfavorable outcomes: longer median duration of ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and more discharges to rehabilitation, home health, or nursing care compared with patients with no pulmonary complication.Both current and modified ventilator-associated events criteria have poor sensitivity but good specificity in identifying pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia. Despite poor sensitivity, the high specificity of the ventilator-associated events diagnoses does provide a useful and objective metric for interinstitution ICU comparison. Ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated condition were both associated with excess morbidity in pediatric traumatic brain injury patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, an accepted rescue therapy for refractory cardiopulmonary failure, requires a complex multidisciplinary approach and advanced technology. Little is known about the relationship between a center's case volume and patient mortality. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation annual volume and in-hospital mortality and assess if a minimum hospital volume could be recommended.Retrospective cohort study.A retrospective cohort admitted to children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System database from 2004 to 2011 supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was identified. Indications were assigned based on patient age (neonatal vs pediatric), diagnosis, and procedure codes. Average hospital annual volume was defined as 0-19, 20-49, or greater than or equal to 50 cases per year. Maximum likelihood estimates were used to assess minimum annual case volume.A total of 7,322 pediatric patients aged 0-18 were supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and had an indication assigned.None.Average hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation volume ranged from 1 to 58 cases per year. Overall mortality was 43\% but differed significantly by indication. After adjustment for case-mix, complexity of cardiac surgery, and year of treatment, patients treated at medium-volume centers (odds ratio, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.75-0.98) and high-volume centers (odds ratio, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.63-0.89) had significantly lower odds of death compared with those treated at low-volume centers. The minimum annual case load most significantly associated with lower mortality was 22 (95\% CI, 22-28).Pediatric centers with low extracorporeal membrane oxygenation average annual case volume had significantly higher mortality and a minimum volume of 22 cases per year was associated with improved mortality. We suggest that this threshold should be evaluated by additional study.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Utah state trauma audit filters assess expeditious care at referring emergency departments for severely injured patients to avoid delays in transfer. We evaluated two state performance measures related to pediatric trauma care before arrival at the Level I trauma center. METHODS: Analysis of the Primary Children's Medical Center (PCMC) trauma database for children with Injury Severity Scores (ISS)>15 from 2006 to 2009 was performed. Patient care was evaluated for referring hospital emergency department triage time of <2 hours and total transfer time of </=6 hours for rural and </=4 hours for urban place of injury. RESULTS: Four hundred twelve patients with ISS>15 were admitted via interhospital transfer from within Utah. Approximately 50% of patients were triaged<2 hours, which increased to almost two thirds when restricted to those initially evaluated within 100 miles (helicopter range) of PCMC. Factors associated with delayed triaged included lower ISS, less severe head injury, greater distance from the trauma center, and primary chest/abdominal injuries. Death and poor outcome did not differ significantly by triage in <2 hours or >/=2 hours. Adherence with the total transfer time goal was 94% for rural and 76% for urban place of injury. CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial nonadherence with trauma performance measures for triage in <2 hours among pediatric trauma patients with ISS >15. Because of low rates of poor outcome, we are unable to determine whether adherence with state triage goals lessens morbidity or mortality.},

  abstract    = {Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common occurrence among intubated pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. However, little is known about the epidemiology, risk factors, and microbiology of VAP in pediatric TBI. We reviewed a cohort of 119 pediatric moderate-to-severe TBI patients and identified 42 with VAP by positive protected bronchial brush specimens. Location of intubation, severity of injury, and antibiotic administration within 2 days after injury were not associated with VAP. Most treatments for elevated intracranial pressure were associated with increased risk of VAP; however, in a multi-variable analysis barbiturate coma (hazard ratio [HR], 3.2; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-7.3), neuromuscular blockade (NMBA; HR, 3.4; 95\% CI 1.6-7.3), and use of a cooling blanket for euthermia (HR 2.4; 95\% CI 1.1-5.5) remained independently associated with VAP. Most VAP (55\%) occurred prior to hospital Day 4 and only 7\% developed VAP after Day 7. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (34\%), Haemophilus influenzae (22\%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (15\%) were the most common organisms, comprising 71\% of isolated pathogens (36\% of infections were polymicrobial). Patients with VAP had significantly longer intensive care unit and hospital stays, as well as increased risk of chronic care needs after discharge, but not mortality. VAP is a common occurrence in pediatric TBI patients, and early empiric therapy for patients requiring barbiturate infusion, NMBA, or use of a cooling blanket could mitigate morbidity.},

  abstract    = {Early posttraumatic seizures may contribute to worsened outcomes after traumatic brain injury. Evidence to guide the evaluation and management of early posttraumatic seizures in children is limited. We undertook a survey of current practices of continuous electroencephalographic monitoring, seizure prophylaxis, and the management of early posttraumatic seizures to provide essential information for trial design and the development of posttraumatic seizure management pathways.Surveys were sent to site principal investigators at all 43 sites participating in the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI trial at the time of the survey. Surveys consisted of 12 questions addressing strategies to 1) implement continuous electroencephalographic monitoring, 2) posttraumatic seizure prophylaxis, 3) treat acute posttraumatic seizures, 4) treat status epilepticus and refractory status epilepticus, and 5) monitor antiseizure drug levels.Institutions comprised a mixture of free-standing children's hospitals and university medical centers across the United States and Europe.Site principal investigators of the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI trial.None.Continuous electroencephalographic monitoring was available in the PICU in the overwhelming majority of clinical sites (98\%); however, the plans to operationalize such monitoring for children varied considerably. A similar majority of sites report that administration of prophylactic antiseizure medications is anticipated in children (93\%); yet, a minority reports that a specified protocol for treatment of posttraumatic seizures is in place (43\%). Reported medication choices varied substantially between sites, but the majority of sites reported pentobarbital for refractory status epilepticus (81\%). The presence of treatment protocols for seizure prophylaxis, early posttraumatic seizures, posttraumatic status epilepticus, and refractory status epilepticus was associated with decreased reported medications (all p < 0.05).This study reports the current management practices for early posttraumatic seizures in select academic centers after pediatric severe traumatic brain injury. The substantial variation in continuous electroencephalographic monitoring implementation, choice of seizure prophylaxis medications, and management of early posttraumatic seizures across institutions was reported, signifying the areas of clinical uncertainty that will help provide focused design of clinical trials. Although sites with treatment protocols reported a decreased number of medications for the scenarios described, completion of the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI trial will be able to determine if these protocols lead to decreased variability in medication administration in children at the clinical sites.},

The objective of this study was to determine whether the Rotterdam CT score can be used for mortality risk stratification after pediatric traumatic brain injury.In children with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, a comparison of observed versus predicted mortality was calculated using published model probabilities of adult mortality. Development and validation of a new pediatric mortality model using randomly selected prediction and validation samples from our cohort.A single level 1 pediatric trauma center.Six hundred thirty-two children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury.None.Sixteen percent of the patients (101 of 632) died prior to hospital discharge. The predicted mortality based on Rotterdam score for adults with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury discriminated pediatric observed mortality well (area under the curve = 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.89) but had poor calibration, overestimating or underestimating mortality for children in several Rotterdam categories. A predictive model based on children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury from the single center discriminated mortality well (area under the curve, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.68-0.91) and showed good calibration and overall fit.Children with traumatic brain injury have better survival than adults in Rotterdam CT score categories representing less severe injuries but worse survival than adults in higher score categories. A novel, validated pediatric mortality model based on the Rotterdam score is accurate in children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury and can be used for risk stratification.},

  Abstract                 = {Optimal stimulation and prevention of anergy in T cells requires signaling through the CD28 molecule. During HIV disease progression, CD28 expression is lost, particularly on CD8+ T cells. Because alterations in cytokine production patterns occur during HIV infection, we determined whether CD8+ T cell phenotype or function was affected by cytokine environment. Treatment of CD8+ T cells with IL-4 decreased levels of both CD28 surface expression and message and increased CD8 expression. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells that had down-regulated CD28 had reduced proliferative capacity. The inhibitory effects of CD28 reduction could be compensated either by increased anti-CD3 or by exogenous IL-2, suggesting that the strength of T cell signaling necessary for the production of IL-2 and subsequent proliferation is negatively regulated by IL-4. CD8+ subpopulations with differential CD28 expression produced different patterns of cytokines, particularly IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells that had reduced CD28 levels but made their own IL-2 were able to proliferate in response to TCR stimulation. These results suggest that loss of CD28 expression and CD8 T cell function can be regulated by the cytokine environment, which may be altered during HIV disease progression. Whether the dysfunction of CD8+ T cells in HIV infection occurs by such a mechanism is the subject of future investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {Family-centered care, which supports family presence (FP) during procedures, is now a widely accepted standard at health care facilities that care for children. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the practice of FP during tracheal intubation (TI) in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Family presence during procedures in PICUs has been advocated.To describe the current practice of FP during TI and evaluate the association with procedural and clinician (including physician, respiratory therapist, and nurse practitioner) outcomes across multiple PICUs.Prospective cohort study in which all TIs from July 2010 to March 2014 in the multicenter TI database (National Emergency Airway Registry for Children [NEAR4KIDS]) were analyzed. Family presence was defined as a family member present during TI. This study included all TIs in patients younger than 18 years in 22 international PICUs.Family presence and no FP during TI in the PICU.The percentage of FP during TIs. First attempt success rate, adverse TI-associated events, multiple attempts (≥ 3), oxygen desaturation (oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry <80\%), and self-reported team stress level.A total of 4969 TI encounters were reported. Among those, 81\% (n = 4030) of TIs had documented FP status (with/without). The median age of participants with FP was 2 years and 1 year for those without FP. The average percentage of TIs with FP was 19\% and varied widely across sites (0\%-43\%; P < .001). Tracheal intubations with FP (vs without FP) were associated with older patients (median, 2 years vs 1 year; P = .04), lower Paediatric Index of Mortality 2 score, and pediatric resident as the first airway clinician (23\%, n = 179 vs 18\%, n = 584; odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.2-1.7). Tracheal intubations with FP and without FP were no different in the first attempt success rate (OR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.18), adverse TI-associated events (any events: OR, 1.06; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.30 and severe events: OR, 1.04; 95\% CI, 0.75-1.43), multiple attempts (≥ 3) (OR, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.82-1.28), oxygen desaturation (oxygen saturation <80\%) (OR, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.80-1.18), or self-reported team stress level (OR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.92-1.31). This result persisted after adjusting for patient and clinician confounders.Wide variability exists in FP during TIs across PICUs. Family presence was not associated with first attempt success, adverse TI-associated events, oxygen desaturation (<80\%), or higher team stress level. Our data suggest that FP during TI can safely be implemented as part of a family-centered care model in the PICU.},

Prospective observational cohort study, May 2013 to November 2015. Two U.S. children's hospitals designated as American College of Surgeons level 1 pediatric trauma centers. Children less than 18 years old admitted to an ICU with acute traumatic brain injury and either a surgical or critical care intervention within the first 24 hours or in-hospital mortality. None. The primary outcome was hospital discharge Functional Status Scale. Most, 133 of 196 (68%), had severe traumatic brain injury (admission Glasgow Coma Scale, 3-8). Overall hospital mortality was 14%; 20% among those with severe traumatic brain injury. Hospital discharge Functional Status Scale had an inverse relationship with Glasgow Coma Scale: for each increase in admission Glasgow Coma Scale by 1, the discharge Functional Status Scale decreased by 0.5 (95% CI, 0.7-0.3). Baseline Functional Status Scale was collected at one site (n = 75). At that site, nearly all (61/62) of the survivors had normal or near-normal (≤ 7) preinjury Functional Status Scale. More than one-third, 23 of 62 (37%), of survivors had new morbidity at hospital discharge (increase in Functional Status Scale, ≥ 3). Among children with severe traumatic brain injury who had baseline Functional Status Scale collected, 21 of 41 survivors (51%) had new morbidity at hospital discharge. The mean change in Functional Status Scale from baseline to hospital discharge was 3.9 ± 4.9 overall and 5.2 ± 5.4 in children with severe traumatic brain injury. More than one-third of survivors, and approximately half of survivors with severe traumatic brain injury, will have new morbidity. Hospital discharge Functional Status Scale, change from baseline Functional Status Scale, and new morbidity acquisition can be used as outcome measures for hospital-based care process improvement initiatives and interventional studies of children with traumatic brain injury.},

  abstract     = {To develop and validate case definitions (computable phenotypes) to accurately identify neurosurgical and critical care events in children with traumatic brain injury. Prospective observational cohort study, May 2013 to September 2015. Two large U.S. children's hospitals with level 1 Pediatric Trauma Centers. One hundred seventy-four children less than 18 years old admitted to an ICU after traumatic brain injury. Prospective data were linked to database codes for each patient. The outcomes were prospectively identified acute traumatic brain injury, intracranial pressure monitor placement, craniotomy or craniectomy, vascular catheter placement, invasive mechanical ventilation, and new gastrostomy tube or tracheostomy placement. Candidate predictors were database codes present in administrative, billing, or trauma registry data. For each clinical event, we developed and validated penalized regression and Boolean classifiers (models to identify clinical events that take database codes as predictors). We externally validated the best model for each clinical event. The primary model performance measure was accuracy, the percent of test patients correctly classified. The cohort included 174 children who required ICU admission after traumatic brain injury. Simple Boolean classifiers were greater than or equal to 94% accurate for seven of nine clinical diagnoses and events. For central venous catheter placement, no classifier achieved 90% accuracy. Classifier accuracy was dependent on available data fields. Five of nine classifiers were acceptably accurate using only administrative data but three required trauma registry fields and two required billing data. In children with traumatic brain injury, computable phenotypes based on simple Boolean classifiers were highly accurate for most neurosurgical and critical care diagnoses and events. The computable phenotypes we developed and validated can be used in any observational study of children with traumatic brain injury and can reasonably be applied in studies of these interventions in other patient populations.},

Posttraumatic seizures risk factors are not completely understood. Our objective was to clarify posttraumatic seizures risk factors in a large cohort of children with severe traumatic brain injury. Retrospective cohort study of a probabilistically linked dataset from the National Trauma Data Bank and the Pediatric Health Information Systems database, 2007-2010. Twenty-nine U.S. children's hospitals. A total of 2,122 children (age, < 18 yr old at admission) with linked National Trauma Data Bank and Pediatric Health Information Systems records, severe (emergency department Glasgow Coma Scale, < 8) traumatic brain injury, hospital length of stay more than 24 hours, and nonmissing disposition. None. The outcome was posttraumatic seizures, identified using validated International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. Prespecified candidate predictors of posttraumatic seizures included age, injury mechanism, emergency department Glasgow Coma Scale, intracranial hemorrhage type, hypoxia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. Posttraumatic seizures were diagnosed in 25.2% of children with severe traumatic brain injury. In those without abuse/assault or subdural hemorrhage, the posttraumatic seizures rate varied between 36.6% in those less than 2 years old and 16.4% in those 14-17 years old. Age, abusive mechanism, and subdural hemorrhage are each significant predictors of posttraumatic seizures. The risk of posttraumatic seizures has a complex relationship with these predictors. The estimated odds of posttraumatic seizures decrease with advancing age, odds ratio equal to 0.929 (0.905-0.954) per additional year of age with no abuse/assault and no subdural hemorrhage; odds ratio equal to 0.820 (0.730-0.922) per additional year of age when abuse and subdural hemorrhage are present. An infant with accidental traumatic brain injury and subdural hemorrhage has approximately the same estimated probability of posttraumatic seizures as an abused infant without subdural hemorrhage (47% [95% CI, 39-55%] vs 50% [95% CI, 41-58%]; p = 0.69). The triad of young age, injury by abuse/assault, and subdural hemorrhage confers the greatest estimated probability for posttraumatic seizures (60% [95% CI, 53-66%]). Posttraumatic seizures risk in children with severe traumatic brain injury is greatest with a triad of younger age, injury by abuse/assault, and subdural hemorrhage. However, posttraumatic seizures are common even in the absence of these factors.},

We sought to understand risks for hospital readmission and trends in mortality during the year following ICU discharge. Retrospective observational cohort study. This study was performed using administrative claims data from 2006-2013 obtained from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Database. We included all children in the dataset admitted to a U.S. ICU less than or equal to 18 years old. The primary outcome was nonelective readmission in the year following discharge. Risk of rehospitalization was determined using a Cox proportional hazards model. We identified 109,130 children with at least one ICU admission in the dataset. Over three quarters of the index ICU admissions (78.6%) had an ICU length of stay less than or equal to 3 days, and the overall index hospitalization mortality rate was 1.4%. In multivariate analysis, risk of nonelective readmission for children without cancer was higher with longer index ICU admission length of stay, younger age, and several chronic and acute conditions. By the end of the 1-year observation period, 36.0% of children with an index ICU length of stay greater than or equal to 14 days had been readmitted, compared with only 13.9% of children who had an index ICU length of stay equals to 1 day. Mortality in the year after ICU discharge was low overall (106 deaths per 10,000 person-years of observation) but was high among children with an initial index ICU admission length of stay greater than or equal to 14 days (599 deaths per 10,000 person-years). Readmission after ICU care is common. Further research is needed to investigate the potentially modifiable factors affecting likelihood of readmissions after discharge from the ICU. Although late mortality was relatively uncommon overall, it was 10-fold higher in the year after ICU discharge than in the general U.S. pediatric population.},

Electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring may be used to detect PTS and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may be used to treat PTS, but national rates of EEG and AED use are not known. The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency and timing of EEG and AED use in children hospitalized after severe TBI. Retrospective cohort study of 2165 children at 30 hospitals in a probabilistically linked dataset from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) and the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database, 2007-2010. We included children (age <18 years old at admission) with linked NTDB and PHIS records, severe (Emergency Department [ED] Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] <8) TBI, hospital length of stay >24 h, and non-missing disposition. The primary outcomes were EEG and AED use. Overall, 31.8% of the cohort had EEG monitoring. Of those, 21.8% were monitored on the first hospital day. The median duration of EEG monitoring was 2.0 (IQR 1.0, 4.0) days. AEDs were prescribed to 52.0% of the cohort, of whom 61.8% received an AED on the first hospital day. The median duration of AED use was 8.0 (IQR 4.0, 17.0) days. EEG monitoring and AED use were more frequent in children with known risk factors for PTS. EEG monitoring and AED use were not related to hospital TBI volume. EEG use is relatively uncommon in children with severe TBI, but AEDs are frequently prescribed. EEG monitoring and AED use are more common in children with known risk factors for PTS.},

For each case, two controls presenting with influenza-like illness but without severe outcomes were included: one random control and one age matched control.Severe outcomes included death or admission to intensive care for assisted ventilation, inotropic support, or both. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to compare cases and controls, with effect sizes measured as adjusted odds ratios.151 (57\%) of the 265 cases were male, the median age was 6 (interquartile range 2.3-10.0) years, and 27 (10\%) died. Six factors were associated with severe outcomes in children presenting with influenza-like illness: history of chronic lung disease (odds ratio 10.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.5 to 69.8), history of cerebral palsy/developmental delay (10.2, 2.0 to 51.4), signs of chest retractions (9.6, 3.2 to 29.0), signs of dehydration (8.8, 1.6 to 49.3), requirement for oxygen (5.8, 2.0 to 16.2), and tachycardia relative to age).These independent risk factors may alert clinicians to children at risk of severe outcomes when presenting with influenza-like illness during future pandemics.},

The Approaches and Decisions for Acute Pediatric TBI (ADAPT) Trial is an observational, cohort study to compare the effectiveness of six aspects of TBI care. Understanding the differences between clinical sites-including their structure, clinical processes, and culture differences-will be necessary to assess differences in outcome from the study and can inform the overall community regarding differences across academic centers.We developed a survey and queried ADAPT site principal investigators with a focus on six domains: (i) hospital, (ii) pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), (iii) medical staff characteristics, (iv) quality of care, (v) medication safety, and (vi) safety culture. Summary statistics were used to describe differences between centers.ADAPT clinical sites that enrolled a subject within the first year (32 US-based, 11 international) were studied. A wide variation in site characteristics was observed in hospital and ICU characteristics, including an almost sevenfold range in ICU size (8-55 beds) and more than fivefold range of overall ICU admissions (537-2623). Nursing staffing (predominantly 1:1 or 1:2) and the presence of pharmacists within the ICU (79 \%) were less variable, and most sites "strongly agreed" or "agreed" that Neurosurgery and Critical Care teams worked well together (81.4 \%). However, a minority of sites (46 \%) used an explicit protocol for treatment of children with severe TBI care.We found a variety of inter-center structure, process, and culture differences. These intrinsic differences between sites may begin to explain why interventional studies have failed to prove efficacy of experimental therapies. Understanding these differences may be an important factor in analyzing future ADAPT trial results and in determining best practices for pediatric severe TBI.},

Children 7 days to 17 years old admitted to the ICU with new traumatic brain injury, stroke, cardiac arrest, CNS infection or inflammation, status epilepticus, spinal cord injury, hydrocephalus, or brain mass. None. We evaluated the prevalence and outcomes of children with predetermined acute neurologic insults. Child and center characteristics were recorded. Unfavorable outcome was defined as change in pre-post insult Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score greater than or equal to 2 or death at hospital discharge or 3 months, whichever came first. Screening data yielded overall prevalence of 16.2%. Of 924 children with acute neurologic insults, cardiac arrest (23%) and traumatic brain injury (19%) were the most common. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge was 12%. Cardiac arrest subjects had highest mortality (24%), and traumatic brain injury subjects had the most unfavorable outcomes (49%). The most common neurologic insult was infection/inflammation in South America, Asia, and the single African site but cardiac arrest in the remaining regions. Neurologic insults are a significant pediatric international health issue. They are frequent and contribute substantial morbidity and mortality. These data suggest a need for an increased focus on acute critical neurologic diseases in infants and children including additional research, enhanced availability of clinical resources, and the development of new therapies.},

  abstract     = {Small series have suggested that outcomes after abusive head trauma are less favorable than after other injury mechanisms. We sought to determine the impact of abusive head trauma on mortality and identify factors that differentiate children with abusive head trauma from those with traumatic brain injury from other mechanisms. First 200 subjects from the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Trial-a comparative effectiveness study using an observational, cohort study design. PICUs in tertiary children's hospitals in United States and abroad. Consecutive children (age < 18 yr) with severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8; intracranial pressure monitoring). None. Demographics, injury-related scores, prehospital, and resuscitation events were analyzed. Children were dichotomized based on likelihood of abusive head trauma. A total of 190 children were included (n = 35 with abusive head trauma). Abusive head trauma subjects were younger (1.87 ± 0.32 vs 9.23 ± 0.39 yr; p < 0.001) and a greater proportion were female (54.3% vs 34.8%; p = 0.032). Abusive head trauma were more likely to 1) be transported from home (60.0% vs 33.5%; p < 0.001), 2) have apnea (34.3% vs 12.3%; p = 0.002), and 3) have seizures (28.6% vs 7.7%; p < 0.001) during prehospital care. Abusive head trauma had a higher prevalence of seizures during resuscitation (31.4 vs 9.7%; p = 0.002). After adjusting for covariates, there was no difference in mortality (abusive head trauma, 25.7% vs nonabusive head trauma, 18.7%; hazard ratio, 1.758; p = 0.60). A similar proportion died due to refractory intracranial hypertension in each group (abusive head trauma, 66.7% vs nonabusive head trauma, 69.0%). In this large, multicenter series, children with abusive head trauma had differences in prehospital and in-hospital secondary injuries which could have therapeutic implications. Unlike other traumatic brain injury populations in children, female predominance was seen in abusive head trauma in our cohort. Similar mortality rates and refractory intracranial pressure deaths suggest that children with severe abusive head trauma may benefit from therapies including invasive monitoring and adherence to evidence-based guidelines.},

  abstract        = {Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is a mainstay of therapy for children with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its overall association with patient outcome is unclear. To test the hypothesis that ICP monitoring is associated with improved functional survival of children with severe TBI. A propensity-weighted effectiveness analysis was conducted using 2 linked national databases with data from 30 US children's hospitals from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2012, on 3084 children with severe TBI. Clinical events including neurosurgical procedures were identified using validated computable phenotypes. Data analysis was conducted from September 1, 2016, to March 1, 2017. Placement of an ICP monitor. A composite of hospital mortality, discharge to hospice, or survival with placement of new tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes. Of the 3084 children in the study (1128 girls and 1956 boys; mean [SD] age, 7.03 [5.44] years), 1002 (32.4%) underwent ICP monitoring, with substantial hospital variation (6% to 50% by hospital). Overall, 484 children (15.7%) experienced the primary composite outcome. A propensity approach using matching weights generated good covariate balance between those who did and those who did not undergo ICP monitoring. Using a propensity-weighted logistic regression model clustered by hospital, no statistically significant difference was found in functional survival between monitored and unmonitored patients (odds ratio of poor outcome among those who underwent ICP monitoring, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.99-1.74). In a prespecified secondary analysis, no difference in mortality was found (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.89-1.50). Prespecified subgroup analyses of children younger and older than 2 years of age and among those with unintentional and inflicted (intentional) injuries also showed no difference in outcome with ICP monitoring. With the use of linked national data and validated computable phenotypes, no evidence was found of a benefit from ICP monitoring on functional survival of children with severe TBI. Intracranial pressure monitoring is a widely but inconsistently used technology with incompletely demonstrated effectiveness. A large prospective cohort study or randomized trial is needed.},
