	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because pediatric trauma-related mortality continues to decline, metrics assessing morbidity are needed to evaluate the impact of treatment after injury. Based on its value for assessing children with traumatic brain injuries and other critical illnesses, Functional Status Scale (FSS), a tool that measures function in six domains (communication, feeding, mental, motor, sensory, and respiratory), was evaluated as an outcome measure for the overall population of injured children.
METHODS: Children with at least one injury (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] severity ≥1) surviving to discharge between December 2011 and April 2013 were identified in a previous study of intensive care unit admissions. Morbidity was defined as additional morbidity in any domain (domain FSS change ≥2 or 'new domain morbidity') and additional overall morbidity (total FSS change ≥3) between preinjury status and discharge. Associations between injury profiles and the development of morbidity were analyzed.
RESULTS: We identified 553 injured children, with a mean of 2.0 $\pm$ 1.9 injuries. New domain and overall morbidity were observed in 17.0% and 11.0% of patients, respectively. New domain morbidity was associated with an increasing number of body regions with an injury with AIS ≥ 2 (p < 0.001), with severe (AIS ≥ 4) head (p = 0.04) and spine (p = 0.01) injuries and with at moderately severe (AIS ≥ 2) lower extremity injuries (p = 0.01). New domain morbidity was more common among patients with severe spine and lower extremity injuries (55.6% and 48.7%, respectively), with greatest impact in the motor domain (55.6% and 43.6%, respectively). New domain morbidity was associated with increasing injury severity score, number of moderately severe injuries and number of body regions with more than a moderately severe injury (p < 0.001 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher morbidity measured by the FSS is associated with increasing injury severity. These findings support the use of the FSS as a metric for assessing outcome after pediatric injury.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To 1) probabilistically link two important pediatric data sources, Virtual Pediatric Systems and PEDSnet, 2) evaluate linkage accuracy overall and in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, and 3) identify variables important to linkage accuracy.
DESIGN: Retrospective linkage of prospectively collected datasets from Virtual Pediatrics Systems, Inc (Los Angeles, CA) and the PEDSnet consortium.
SETTING: Single-center academic PICU.
PATIENTS: All PICU encounters between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017, that were deterministically matched between the two datasets.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We abstracted records from Virtual Pediatric Systems and PEDSnet corresponding to PICU encounters and probabilistically linked using 44 features shared by the two datasets. We generated a gold standard deterministic linkage using protected health information elements, which were then removed from datasets. We then calculated candidate pair log-likelihood ratios for all pairs of subjects and selected optimal pairs in a two-stage algorithm. A total of 22,051 gold standard PICU encounter pairs were identified over the study period. The optimal linkage model demonstrated excellent discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve > 0.99); 19,801 cases (89.9%) were matched with 13 false positives. The addition of two protected health information dates (admission month, birth day-of-year) increased to 20,189 (91.6%) the cases matched, with three false positives. Restricting to patients with Virtual Pediatric Systems diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock (n = 1,340 [6.1%]) matched 1,250 cases (93.2%) with zero false positives. Increased number of laboratory values present in the first 12 hours of admission significantly increased log-likelihood ratios, suggesting stronger candidate pair matching.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the use of probabilistic linkage to accurately join two complementary pediatric critical care datasets at a single academic PICU in the absence of protected health information. Combining datasets with curated diagnoses and granular measurements can validate patient acuity metrics and facilitate multicenter machine learning algorithms. We anticipate these methods will generalize to other common PICU diagnoses.},

@article{Xing2019,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Nucleus recognition is a critical yet challenging step in histopathology image analysis, for example, in Ki67 immunohistochemistry stained images. Although many automated methods have been proposed, most use a multi-stage processing pipeline to categorize nuclei, leading to cumbersome, low-throughput, and error-prone assessments. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep fully convolutional network for single-stage nucleus recognition.
METHODS: Instead of conducting direct pixel-wise classification, we formulate nucleus identification as a deep structured regression model. For each input image, it produces multiple proximity maps, each of which corresponds to one nucleus category and exhibits strong responses in central regions of the nuclei. In addition, by taking into consideration the nucleus distribution in histopathology images, we further introduce an auxiliary task, region of interest (ROI) extraction, to assist and boost the nucleus quantification with weak ROI annotation. The proposed network can be learned in an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel manner for simultaneous nucleus detection and classification.
RESULTS: We have evaluated this network on a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor Ki67 image dataset, and the experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches.
CONCLUSION: We present a new, pixel-to-pixel deep neural network with two sibling branches for effective nucleus recognition and observe that learning with another relevant task, ROI extraction, can further boost individual nucleus localization and classification.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our method provides a clean, single-stage nucleus recognition pipeline for histopathology image analysis, especially a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification, which would potentially benefit individual object quantification in whole-slide images.},

@article{Xing2019_miccai,
	abstract = {Cell or nucleus quantification has recently achieved state-of-the-art performance by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In general, training CNNs requires a large amount of annotated microscopy image data, which is prohibitively expensive or even impossible to obtain in some applications. Additionally, when applying a deep supervised model to new datasets, it is common to annotate individual cells in those target datasets for model re-training or fine-tuning, leading to low-throughput image analysis. In this paperSSS, we propose a novel adversarial domain adaptation method for cell/nucleus quantification across multimodality microscopy image data. Specifically, we learn a fully convolutional network detector with task-specific cycle-consistent adversarial learning, which conducts pixel-level adaptation between source and target domains and completes a cell/nucleus detection task. Then we generate pseudo-labels on target training data using the detector trained with adapted source images and further fine-tune the detector towards the target domain to boost the performance. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple cross-modality microscopy image datasets and obtain a significant improvement in cell/nucleus detection compared to the reference baselines and a recent state-of-the-art deep domain adaptation approach. In addition, our method is very competitive with the fully supervised models trained with all real target training labels.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to describe current outcomes of Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome present on day 1 of PICU admission.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study.
SETTING: Virtual Pediatric Systems, LLC, database admissions, January 2014 and December 2015.
PATIENTS: We analyzed 194,017 consecutive PICU admissions, (age 1 mo to 18 yr) from the 2014-2015 Virtual Pediatric Systems database.
INTERVENTIONS: We identified day 1 Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome by International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference criteria with day 1 laboratory and vital sign values. Functional status was evaluated by Pediatric Overall Performance Category and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scores from PICU admission and discharge.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Overall, PICU mortality was 2.1%. We identified day 1 Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome in 14.4% of admissions. Patients with Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome had higher mortality than those without Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (10.3% vs 0.7%; p < 0.0001), and a higher percentage of survivors had greater than or equal to 2 category worsening in Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score (3.6% vs 0.5%; p < 0.0001) or Pediatric Overall Performance Category score (6.0% vs 1.8%; p < 0.0001). The odds of death with day 1 Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome was 14.3 (95% CI, 13-15.7), while the odds of death or discharge with Pediatric Overall Performance Category/Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score greater than or equal to 3 (poor functional outcome) was 6.7 (95% CI, 6-7.4). In a subset of 148,188 patients from hospitals where limitation of support decisions were recorded, 5.8% patients with Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome had limitation of support decisions in place, compared with 0.8% of patients without Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (p < 0.0001). Of day 1 Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome patients who died, 43.1% had limitation of support decisions in place, and 41.6% had withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome present on day 1 of admission continues to be a major source of morbidity and mortality in the PICU, but risk of poor neurologic outcome may be improved. Further research is needed to understand decisions regarding limitation of support and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy decisions in patients admitted with day 1 Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome.},

@article{Marsh2019,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Little is known about how parents of children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) participate or feel they should participate in decision making regarding placing an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor. The objective of this study was to identify the perspectives and decisional or information needs of parents whose child sustained a TBI and may require an ICP monitor.
METHODS: This was a qualitative study at one US level I pediatric trauma center. The authors conducted in-depth semistructured interviews with 1) parents of critically injured children who have sustained a TBI and 2) clinicians who regularly care for children with TBI.
RESULTS: The authors interviewed 10 parents of 7 children (60% were mothers and 80% were white) and 28 clinicians (17 ICU clinicians and 11 surgeons). Overall, the authors found concordance between and among parents and clinicians about parental involvement in ICP monitor decision making. Parents and clinicians agreed that decision making about ICP monitoring in children who have suffered TBI is not and should not be shared between the parents and clinicians. The concordance was represented in 3 emergent themes. Parents wanted transparency, communication, and information (theme 2), but the life-threatening context of this decision (theme 1) created an environment where all involved reflected a clear preference for paternalism (theme 3).
CONCLUSIONS: The clear and concordant preference for clinician paternalistic decision making coupled with the parents' needs to be informed suggests that a decision support tool for this decision should be clinician facing and should emphasize transparency in collaborative decision making between clinicians.},

@article{Ferrazzano2019,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is no consensus on the optimal timing and specific brain MRI sequences in the evaluation and management of severe pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI), and information on current practices is lacking. The authors performed a survey of MRI practices among sites participating in a multicenter study of severe pediatric TBI to provide information for designing future clinical trials using MRI to assess brain injury after severe pediatric TBI.
METHODS: Information on current imaging practices and resources was collected from 27 institutions participating in the Approaches and Decisions after Pediatric TBI Trial. Multiple-choice questions addressed the percentage of patients with TBI who have MRI studies, timing of MRI, MRI sequences used to investigate TBI, as well as the magnetic field strength of MR scanners used at the participating institutions and use of standardized MRI protocols for imaging after severe pediatric TBI.
RESULTS: Overall, the reported use of MRI in pediatric patients with severe TBI at participating sites was high, with 40% of sites indicating that they obtain MRI studies in > 95% of this patient population. Differences were observed in the frequency of MRI use between US and international sites, with the US sites obtaining MRI in a higher proportion of their pediatric patients with severe TBI (94% of US vs 44% of international sites reported MRI in at least 70% of patients with severe TBI). The reported timing and composition of MRI studies was highly variable across sites. Sixty percent of sites reported typically obtaining an MRI study within the first 7 days postinjury, with the remainder of responses distributed throughout the first 30-day postinjury period. Responses indicated that MRI sequences sensitive for diffuse axonal injury and ischemia are frequently obtained in patients with TBI, whereas perfusion imaging and spectroscopy techniques are less common.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this survey suggest that despite the lack of consensus or guidelines, MRI is commonly obtained during the acute clinical setting after severe pediatric TBI. The variation in MRI practices highlights the need for additional studies to determine the utility, optimal timing, and composition of clinical MRI studies after TBI. The information in this survey describes current clinical MRI practices in children with severe TBI and identifies important challenges and objectives that should be considered when designing future studies.},

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 43 years (range, 30-66 yr), mean experience of 10 years (range, 0-30 yr), were 46% female (13/28), and 96% white (27/28). A novel conceptual model emerged that related the difficulty of the decision about intracranial pressure monitor placement (y-axis) with the estimated outcome of the patient (x-axis). This model had a bimodal shape, with the most difficult decisions occurring for patients who 1) had a good opportunity for recovery but whose neurologic examination had not yet normalized or 2) had a low but uncertain likelihood of neurologically functional recovery. Emergent themes included gaps in medical knowledge and information available for decision-making, differences in perspective between clinical specialties, and ethical implications of decision-making about intracranial pressure monitoring. Experienced clinicians described less difficulty with decision-making overall.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with severe traumatic brain injury near perceived transition points along a spectrum of potential for recovery present challenges for decision-making about intracranial pressure monitor placement. Clinician experience and specialty discipline further influence decision-making. These findings will contribute to the design of a multidisciplinary clinical decision support tool for intracranial pressure monitor placement in children with traumatic brain injury.},

@article{Ahmed2018,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because pediatric trauma-related mortality continue to decline, metrics assessing morbidity are needed to evaluate the impact of treatment after injury. Based of its value for assessing children with traumatic brain injuries and other critical illnesses, Functional Status Scale (FSS), a tool that measures function in six domains (communication, feeding, mental, motor, sensory and respiratory), was evaluated as an outcome measure for the overall population of injured children.
METHODS: Children with at least one injury (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] severity ≥1) surviving to discharge between December 2011 and April 2013 were identified in a previous study of intensive care unit admissions. Morbidity was defined as additional morbidity in any domain (domain FSS change ≥2) and additional overall morbidity (total FSS change ≥3 or 'new domain morbidity') between preinjury status and discharge. Associations between injury profiles and the development of morbidity were analyzed.
RESULTS: We identified 553 injured children, with an average of 2.0 $\pm$ 1.9 injuries. New domain and overall morbidity were observed in 17.0% and 11.0% of patients, respectively. New domain morbidity was associated with an increasing number of body regions with an injury with AIS≥ 2 (P<0.001), with severe (AIS ≥ 4) head (P=0.04) and spine (P=0.01) injuries and with at moderately severe (AIS ≥ 2) lower extremity injuries (P=0.01). New domain morbidity was more common among patients with severe spine and lower extremity injuries (55.6% and 48.7%, respectively), with greatest impact in the motor domain (55.6% and 43.6%, respectively). New domain morbidity was associated with increasing ISS, number of moderately severe injuries and number of body regions with more than a moderately severe injury (P<0.001 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher morbidity measured by the FSS is associated with increasing injury severity. These findings support the use of the FSS as a metric for assessing outcome after pediatric injury.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between the Functional Status Scale and Pediatric Functional Independence Measure scores during the rehabilitation stay in children who survive traumatic brain injury.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital with a level 1 trauma center and inpatient rehabilitation service.
PATIENTS: Sixty-five children less than 18 years old admitted to an ICU with acute traumatic brain injury and subsequently transferred to the inpatient rehabilitation service.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Functional Status Scale and Pediatric Functional Independence Measure at transfer to rehabilitation and Pediatric Functional Independence Measure at discharge from rehabilitation. The median age of the cohort was 7.1 years (interquartile range, 0.8-12.3 yr), and 29% were female. Nearly all of the children were healthy prior to the traumatic brain injury: six patients (9.2%) had a baseline Functional Status Scale score greater than 6. At the time of transfer to inpatient rehabilitation, total Functional Status Scale and Pediatric Functional Independence Measure scores had the expected negative correlation due to increasing disability resulting in lower scores in Pediatric Functional Independence Measure and higher scores in Functional Status Scale (r = -0.49; 95% CI, -0.62 to -0.35). Among subjects with less disability as measured by lower total Functional Status Scale scores, we found substantial variability in the total Pediatric Functional Independence Measure scores. In contrast, Pediatric Functional Independence Measure scores were consistently low among subjects with a wide range of higher total Functional Status Scale scores (more disability).
CONCLUSIONS: Although proprietary and more time-intensive, the Pediatric Functional Independence Measure has advantages relative to the Functional Status Scale for less severely injured patients and task-specific measurements. The Functional Status Scale may have advantages relative to the Pediatric Functional Independence Measure for more severely injured patients. Further investigations are needed to characterize changes in the Functional Status Scale during the rehabilitation stay and after discharge.},

@article{Sarnaik2018,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although small series have suggested that younger age is associated with less favorable outcome after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), confounders and biases have limited our understanding of this relationship. We hypothesized that there would be an association between age and mortality in children within an ongoing observational, cohort study.
METHODS: The first 200 subjects from the Approaches and Decisions for Acute Pediatric TBI trial were eligible for this analysis (inclusion criteria: severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score ≤ 8], age 18 years, and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor placed; exclusion: pregnancy). Children with suspected abusive head trauma (AHT) were excluded to avoid bias related to the association between AHT and mortality. Demographics, and prehospital and resuscitation events were collected/analyzed, and children were stratified based on age at time of injury (< 5, 5-< 11, 11-18 years) and presented as mean $\pm$ standard error of the mean (SEM). Analyses of variance were used to test the equality of the means across the group for continuous variable, and Chi-square tests were used to compare percentages for discrete variables (post hoc comparisons were made using t test and Bonferroni corrections, as needed). Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for each age subgroup describing the time of death, and log-rank was used to compare the curves. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the effect of age on time to death while controlling for covariates.
RESULTS: In the final cohort (n = 155, 45 excluded for AHT), overall age was 9.2 years $\pm$ 0.4 and GCS was 5.3 $\pm$ 0.1. Mortality was similar between strata (14.0, 20.0, 20.9%, respectively, p = 0.58). Motor vehicle accidents were the most common mechanism across all strata, while falls tended to be more common in the youngest stratum (p = 0.08). The youngest stratum demonstrated increased incidence of spontaneous hypothermia at presentation and decreased hemoglobin concentrations and coagulopathies, while the oldest demonstrated lower platelet counts.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous reports, we failed to detect mortality differences across age strata in children with severe TBI. We have discerned novel associations between age and various markers of injury-unrelated to AHT-that may lead to testable hypotheses in the future.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate, etiology, and timing of unplanned and planned hospital readmissions and to identify risk factors for unplanned readmission in children who survive a hospitalization for trauma.
DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study of a probabilistically linked dataset from the National Trauma Data Bank and the Pediatric Health Information System database, 2007-2012.
SETTING: Twenty-nine U.S. children's hospitals.
PATIENTS: 51,591 children (< 18 yr at admission) who survived more than or equal to a 2-day hospitalization for trauma.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was unplanned readmission within 1 year of discharge from the injury hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included any readmission, reason for readmission, time to readmission, and number of readmissions within 1 year of discharge. The primary exposure groups were isolated traumatic brain injury, both traumatic brain injury and other injury, or nontraumatic brain injury only. We hypothesized a priori that any traumatic brain injury would be associated with both planned and unplanned hospital readmission. We used All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups codes to categorize readmissions by etiology and planned or unplanned. Overall, 4,301/49,982 of the patients (8.6%) with more than or equal to 1 year of observation time were readmitted to the same hospital within 1 year. Many readmissions were unplanned: 2,704/49,982 (5.4%) experienced an unplanned readmission in the first year. The most common reason for unplanned readmission was infection (22%), primarily postoperative or posttraumatic infection (38% of readmissions for infection). Traumatic brain injury was associated with lower odds of unplanned readmission in multivariable analyses. Seizure or RBC transfusion during the index hospitalization were the strongest predictors of unplanned, earlier, and multiple readmissions.
CONCLUSIONS: Many survivors of pediatric trauma experience unplanned, and potentially preventable, hospital readmissions in the year after discharge. Identification of those at highest risk of readmission can guide targeted in-hospital or postdischarge interventions.},

	abstract = {The purposes of this study, in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI), to describe cervical spine imaging practice, to assess for recent changes in imaging practice, and to determine whether cervical spine computed tomography (CT) is being used in children at low risk for cervical spine injury.The setting was children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database, from January 2001 to June 2011. Participants were children (younger than 18 y) with TBI who were evaluated in the emergency department, admitted to the hospital, and received a head CT scan on the day of admission. The primary outcome measures were cervical spine imaging studies. This study was exempted from institutional review board assessment.A total of 30,112 children met study criteria. Overall, 52\% (15,687/30,112) received cervical spine imaging. The use of cervical spine radiographs alone decreased between 2001 (47\%) and 2011 (23\%), with an annual decrease of 2.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.1\%-3.3\%), and was largely replaced by an increased use of CT, with or without radiographs (8.6\% in 2001 and 19.5\% in 2011, with an annual increase of 0.9\%; 95\% CI, 0.1\%-1.8\%). A total of 2545 children received cervical spine CT despite being discharged alive from the hospital in less than 72 hours, and 1655 of those had a low-risk mechanism of injury.The adoption of CT clearance of the cervical spine in adults seems to have influenced the care of children with TBI, despite concerns about radiation exposure.},

	abstract = {Record linkage may create powerful datasets with which investigators can conduct comparative effectiveness studies evaluating the impact of tests or interventions on health. All linkages of health care data files to date have used protected health information (PHI) in their linkage variables. A technique to link datasets without using PHI would be advantageous both to preserve privacy and to increase the number of potential linkages.We applied probabilistic linkage to records of injured children in the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB, N = 156,357) and the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS, N = 104,049) databases from 2007 to 2010. 49 match variables without PHI were used, many of them administrative variables and indicators for procedures recorded as International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification codes. We validated the accuracy of the linkage using identified data from a single center that submits to both databases.We accurately linked the PHIS and NTDB records for 69\% of children with any injury, and 88\% of those with severe traumatic brain injury eligible for a study of intervention effectiveness (positive predictive value of 98\%, specificity of 99.99\%). Accurate linkage was associated with longer lengths of stay, more severe injuries, and multiple injuries.In populations with substantial illness or injury severity, accurate record linkage may be possible in the absence of PHI. This methodology may enable linkages and, in turn, comparative effectiveness studies that would be unlikely or impossible otherwise.},

	abstract = {To describe patient demographics, interventions, and outcomes in hospitalized children with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) complicating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).We performed a retrospective cohort study using data recorded in the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database from October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2010. Participants had International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes for MAS and either SLE or JIA. The primary outcome was hospital mortality (for the index admission). Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admission, critical care interventions, and medication use.A total of 121 children at 28 children's hospitals met the inclusion criteria, including 19 children with SLE and 102 children with JIA. The index admission mortality rate was 7\% (8 of 121 patients). ICU admission (33\%), mechanical ventilation (26\%), and inotrope/vasopressor therapy (26\%) were common. Compared to children with JIA, those with SLE had a similar mortality rate (6\% versus 11\%, respectively; exact P = 0.6). More patients with SLE than those with JIA received ICU care (63\% versus 27\%; P = 0.002), received mechanical ventilation (53\% versus 21\%; P = 0.003), and had cardiovascular dysfunction (47\% versus 23\% received inotrope/vasopressor therapy; P = 0.02). Children with SLE and those with JIA received cyclosporine at similar rates, but more children with SLE received cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil, and more children with JIA received interleukin-1 antagonists.Organ system dysfunction is common in children with rheumatic diseases complicated by MAS, and more organ system support is required in children with underlying SLE than in children with JIA. Current treatment of pediatric MAS varies based on the underlying rheumatic disease.},

MAIN ANALYSIS: Cox regression.The predictor of interest was the patient-specific peak serum ferritin level, dichotomized a priori at 3000 ng/mL. The outcomes were mortality and intensive care unit admission. A total of 171 patients met the inclusion criteria. The observation time without death or intensive care unit admission ranged from 184 to 1621 days. The hazard ratio of death with peak ferritin of >3000 ng/mL was 4.32 (95\% confidence interval 2.21-8.47, p < .001) compared to peak ferritin of 1000-3000 ng/mL. The hazard ratio of intensive care unit admission with peak ferritin of >3000 ng/mL was 2.49 (95\% confidence interval 1.53-4.05, p < .001) compared to peak ferritin of 1000-3000 ng/mL. Both estimates were adjusted for bone marrow transplant, solid organ transplant, hemoglobinopathy, and existing rheumatologic disease.In this pediatric population, with serum ferritin levels of >3000 ng/mL, there was increased risk for both receipt of critical care and subsequent death.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanism, crash characteristics, and spectrum of lower extremity injuries in children restrained in forward-facing car seats during front and rear impacts have not been described. METHODS: We identified in two databases children who sustained lower extremity injuries while restrained in forward-facing car seats. To identify the mechanism, we analyzed crash reconstructions from three frontal-impact cases from the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network. To further describe the crash and injury characteristics we evaluated children between 1 and 4 years of age with lower extremity injuries from front or rear impacts in the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) database. RESULTS: Crash reconstruction data demonstrated that the likely mechanism of lower extremity injury was contact between the legs and the front seatbacks. In the CDS database, we identified 15 children with lower extremity injuries in a forward-facing child seat, usually (13 out of 15) placed in the rear seat, incurred in frontal impacts (11 out of 15). Several (5 out of 15) children were in unbelted or improperly secured forward-facing car seats. Injury Severity Scores varied widely (5-50). CONCLUSIONS: Children in forward-facing car seats involved in severe front or rear crashes may incur a range of lower extremity injury from impact with the car interior component in front of them. Crash scene photography can provide useful information about anatomic sites at risk for injury and alert emergency department providers to possible subtle injury.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to determine the effect of birth hospital pediatric cardiac specialty center status and neonatal level of care on 90-day mortality for infants with ductal-dependent congenital heart disease. METHODS: A population-based, retrospective, cohort study was conducted in Washington State in 1987-2006. All infants born in Washington with gestational ages of >/=32 weeks and birth weights of >/=1500 g who were admitted to a Washington hospital for the care of a congenital cardiac anomaly likely to be ductal dependent were included. Subjects were required to receive a surgical or interventional cardiac procedure within 30 days after birth. Birth certificate data were linked with death certificate data and hospital administrative records. The exposures of interest were birth hospital pediatric cardiac specialty center status and neonatal level of care. The primary outcome was death within 90 days. RESULTS: A total of 823 infants met the inclusion criteria, 285 born at specialty centers and 538 at other centers. After adjustment for cardiac diagnoses, other congenital anomalies, birth year, maternal income quartile, and definitive-care hospital, there was no significant difference in 90-day mortality for infants born at specialty centers versus other centers (odds ratio: 1.05 [95% confidence interval: 0.65-1.68]). CONCLUSION: For infants with ductal-dependent congenital heart disease, there was no difference in 90-day mortality for infants born at specialty centers versus other centers in the state of Washington.},

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database (January 2001-June 2011). PARTICIPANTS: Children (age <18y) with TBI (N=21,399) who were admitted to the intensive care unit and survived to hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PT or OT evaluation and speech or swallow therapy evaluation. A propensity score was calculated to allow comparison of expected with observed rates of therapy evaluations by the hospital. RESULTS: The median hospital length of stay was 5 days (interquartile range, 3-10d). Overall, 8748 (41%) of 21,399 children received either a PT or OT evaluation, and 5490 (26%) out of 21,399 children received either a speech or swallow evaluation. Older children and those with higher energy injury mechanisms, more severe injuries, extremity fractures, more treatment with neuromuscular blocking agents or pentobarbital, and admission to a hospital with an American College of Surgeons Level I pediatric trauma designation were more likely to receive therapy evaluations. The median time until the first therapy evaluation was 5 (PT or OT) and 7 days (speech or swallow). Expected hospital evaluation rates were 25% to 54% (PT or OT) and 16% to 35% (speech or swallow), while observed hospital evaluation rates were 11% to 74% (PT or OT) and 4% to 55% (speech or swallow). CONCLUSIONS: There is wide between-hospital variation in provision of rehabilitation therapies for children with TBI. Evidence-based criteria for initiation of routine therapy evaluations after TBI are needed.},

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database (January 2001 to June 2011). PARTICIPANTS: Children (aged <18 years) with TBI and head Abbreviated Injury Scale scores of at least 3 who were ventilated for at least 96 consecutive hours or who died in the first 4 days after hospital admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Monitoring of ICP. RESULTS: A total of 4667 children met the study criteria. Hospital mortality was 41% (n = 1919). Overall, 55% of patients (n = 2586) received ICP monitoring. Expected hospital ICP monitoring rates after adjustment for patient age, cardiac arrest, inflicted injury, craniotomy or craniectomy, head Abbreviated Injury Scale score, and Injury Severity Score were 47% to 60%. Observed hospital ICP monitoring rates were 14% to 83%. Hospitals with more observed ICP monitoring, relative to expected, and hospitals with higher patient volumes had lower rates of mortality or severe disability. After adjustment for between-hospital variation and patient severity of injury, ICP monitoring was independently associated with age 1 year and older (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.5-3.8) vs age younger than 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: There was significant between-hospital variation in ICP monitoring that cannot be attributed solely to differences in case mix. Hospitals that monitor ICP more frequently and hospitals with higher patient volumes had better patient outcomes. Infants with TBI are less likely to receive ICP monitoring than are older children.},

We conducted a narrative review of the medical literature, categorized the data sources available to PCCM investigators, and created an online data source registry. We found that many data sources are available for research in PCCM. To date, PCCM investigators have most often relied on pediatric critical care registries and treatment- or disease-specific registries. The available data sources vary widely in the level of clinical detail and the types of questions they can reliably answer. Linkage of data sources can expand the types of questions that a data source can be used to study. Careful matching of the scientific question to the best available data source or linked data sources is necessary.

After adjustment for hospital-level variation, primary insurance payer, and overall injury severity, use of both drugs was independently associated with older patient age, intracranial hemorrhage (other than epidural), skull fracture, and higher head/neck injury severity. Hypertonic saline use increased and mannitol use decreased with publication of the 2003 guidelines, and these trends continued through 2008. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertonic saline and mannitol are used less in infants than in older children. The patient-level and hospital-level variation in osmolar therapy use and the substantial amount of sustained osmolar therapy without intracranial pressure monitoring suggest opportunities to improve the quality of pediatric traumatic brain injury care. With limited high-quality evidence available, published expert guidelines appear to significantly impact clinical practice in this area.},

We assessed the ventilator-associated events algorithm in pediatric patients.A retrospective observational cohort study.This single-center study took place in a PICU at an urban academic medical facility.Pediatric (ages 0-18 yr old) trauma patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury ventilated for greater than or equal to 2 days.We assessed for pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia (as defined by current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PNU2 guidelines), adult ventilator-associated events, and an experimental ventilator-associated events definition modified for pediatric patients. We compared ventilator-associated events to ventilator-associated pneumonia to calculate the test characteristics. Thirty-nine of 119 patients (33\%) developed ventilator-associated pneumonia. Sensitivity of the adult ventilator-associated condition definition was 23\% (95\% CI, 11-39\%), which increased to 56\% (95\% CI, 40-72\%) using the modified pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia criterion. Specificity reached 100\% for both original and modified pediatric probable ventilator-associated pneumonia using ventilator-associated events criteria. Children who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia or ventilator-associated condition had similar baseline characteristics: age, mechanism of injury, injury severity scores, and use of an intracranial pressure monitor. Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated condition portended similarly unfavorable outcomes: longer median duration of ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and more discharges to rehabilitation, home health, or nursing care compared with patients with no pulmonary complication.Both current and modified ventilator-associated events criteria have poor sensitivity but good specificity in identifying pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia. Despite poor sensitivity, the high specificity of the ventilator-associated events diagnoses does provide a useful and objective metric for interinstitution ICU comparison. Ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated condition were both associated with excess morbidity in pediatric traumatic brain injury patients.},

Little is known about the relationship between a center's case volume and patient mortality. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation annual volume and in-hospital mortality and assess if a minimum hospital volume could be recommended.Retrospective cohort study.A retrospective cohort admitted to children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System database from 2004 to 2011 supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was identified. Indications were assigned based on patient age (neonatal vs pediatric), diagnosis, and procedure codes. Average hospital annual volume was defined as 0-19, 20-49, or greater than or equal to 50 cases per year. Maximum likelihood estimates were used to assess minimum annual case volume.A total of 7,322 pediatric patients aged 0-18 were supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and had an indication assigned.None.Average hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation volume ranged from 1 to 58 cases per year. Overall mortality was 43\% but differed significantly by indication. After adjustment for case-mix, complexity of cardiac surgery, and year of treatment, patients treated at medium-volume centers (odds ratio, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.75-0.98) and high-volume centers (odds ratio, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.63-0.89) had significantly lower odds of death compared with those treated at low-volume centers. The minimum annual case load most significantly associated with lower mortality was 22 (95\% CI, 22-28).Pediatric centers with low extracorporeal membrane oxygenation average annual case volume had significantly higher mortality and a minimum volume of 22 cases per year was associated with improved mortality. We suggest that this threshold should be evaluated by additional study.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Utah state trauma audit filters assess expeditious care at referring emergency departments for severely injured patients to avoid delays in transfer. We evaluated two state performance measures related to pediatric trauma care before arrival at the Level I trauma center. METHODS: Analysis of the Primary Children's Medical Center (PCMC) trauma database for children with Injury Severity Scores (ISS)>15 from 2006 to 2009 was performed. Patient care was evaluated for referring hospital emergency department triage time of <2 hours and total transfer time of </=6 hours for rural and </=4 hours for urban place of injury. RESULTS: Four hundred twelve patients with ISS>15 were admitted via interhospital transfer from within Utah. Approximately 50% of patients were triaged<2 hours, which increased to almost two thirds when restricted to those initially evaluated within 100 miles (helicopter range) of PCMC. Factors associated with delayed triaged included lower ISS, less severe head injury, greater distance from the trauma center, and primary chest/abdominal injuries. Death and poor outcome did not differ significantly by triage in <2 hours or >/=2 hours. Adherence with the total transfer time goal was 94% for rural and 76% for urban place of injury. CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial nonadherence with trauma performance measures for triage in <2 hours among pediatric trauma patients with ISS >15. Because of low rates of poor outcome, we are unable to determine whether adherence with state triage goals lessens morbidity or mortality.},

	abstract = {Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common occurrence among intubated pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. However, little is known about the epidemiology, risk factors, and microbiology of VAP in pediatric TBI. We reviewed a cohort of 119 pediatric moderate-to-severe TBI patients and identified 42 with VAP by positive protected bronchial brush specimens. Location of intubation, severity of injury, and antibiotic administration within 2 days after injury were not associated with VAP. Most treatments for elevated intracranial pressure were associated with increased risk of VAP; however, in a multi-variable analysis barbiturate coma (hazard ratio [HR], 3.2; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-7.3), neuromuscular blockade (NMBA; HR, 3.4; 95\% CI 1.6-7.3), and use of a cooling blanket for euthermia (HR 2.4; 95\% CI 1.1-5.5) remained independently associated with VAP. Most VAP (55\%) occurred prior to hospital Day 4 and only 7\% developed VAP after Day 7. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (34\%), Haemophilus influenzae (22\%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (15\%) were the most common organisms, comprising 71\% of isolated pathogens (36\% of infections were polymicrobial). Patients with VAP had significantly longer intensive care unit and hospital stays, as well as increased risk of chronic care needs after discharge, but not mortality. VAP is a common occurrence in pediatric TBI patients, and early empiric therapy for patients requiring barbiturate infusion, NMBA, or use of a cooling blanket could mitigate morbidity.},

Evidence to guide the evaluation and management of early posttraumatic seizures in children is limited. We undertook a survey of current practices of continuous electroencephalographic monitoring, seizure prophylaxis, and the management of early posttraumatic seizures to provide essential information for trial design and the development of posttraumatic seizure management pathways.Surveys were sent to site principal investigators at all 43 sites participating in the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI trial at the time of the survey. Surveys consisted of 12 questions addressing strategies to 1) implement continuous electroencephalographic monitoring, 2) posttraumatic seizure prophylaxis, 3) treat acute posttraumatic seizures, 4) treat status epilepticus and refractory status epilepticus, and 5) monitor antiseizure drug levels.Institutions comprised a mixture of free-standing children's hospitals and university medical centers across the United States and Europe.Site principal investigators of the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI trial.None.Continuous electroencephalographic monitoring was available in the PICU in the overwhelming majority of clinical sites (98\%); however, the plans to operationalize such monitoring for children varied considerably. A similar majority of sites report that administration of prophylactic antiseizure medications is anticipated in children (93\%); yet, a minority reports that a specified protocol for treatment of posttraumatic seizures is in place (43\%). Reported medication choices varied substantially between sites, but the majority of sites reported pentobarbital for refractory status epilepticus (81\%). The presence of treatment protocols for seizure prophylaxis, early posttraumatic seizures, posttraumatic status epilepticus, and refractory status epilepticus was associated with decreased reported medications (all p < 0.05).This study reports the current management practices for early posttraumatic seizures in select academic centers after pediatric severe traumatic brain injury. The substantial variation in continuous electroencephalographic monitoring implementation, choice of seizure prophylaxis medications, and management of early posttraumatic seizures across institutions was reported, signifying the areas of clinical uncertainty that will help provide focused design of clinical trials. Although sites with treatment protocols reported a decreased number of medications for the scenarios described, completion of the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI trial will be able to determine if these protocols lead to decreased variability in medication administration in children at the clinical sites.},

	abstract = {Optimal stimulation and prevention of anergy in T cells requires signaling through the CD28 molecule. During HIV disease progression, CD28 expression is lost, particularly on CD8+ T cells. Because alterations in cytokine production patterns occur during HIV infection, we determined whether CD8+ T cell phenotype or function was affected by cytokine environment. Treatment of CD8+ T cells with IL-4 decreased levels of both CD28 surface expression and message and increased CD8 expression. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells that had down-regulated CD28 had reduced proliferative capacity. The inhibitory effects of CD28 reduction could be compensated either by increased anti-CD3 or by exogenous IL-2, suggesting that the strength of T cell signaling necessary for the production of IL-2 and subsequent proliferation is negatively regulated by IL-4. CD8+ subpopulations with differential CD28 expression produced different patterns of cytokines, particularly IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells that had reduced CD28 levels but made their own IL-2 were able to proliferate in response to TCR stimulation. These results suggest that loss of CD28 expression and CD8 T cell function can be regulated by the cytokine environment, which may be altered during HIV disease progression. Whether the dysfunction of CD8+ T cells in HIV infection occurs by such a mechanism is the subject of future investigation.},

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the practice of FP during tracheal intubation (TI) in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Family presence during procedures in PICUs has been advocated.To describe the current practice of FP during TI and evaluate the association with procedural and clinician (including physician, respiratory therapist, and nurse practitioner) outcomes across multiple PICUs.Prospective cohort study in which all TIs from July 2010 to March 2014 in the multicenter TI database (National Emergency Airway Registry for Children [NEAR4KIDS]) were analyzed. Family presence was defined as a family member present during TI. This study included all TIs in patients younger than 18 years in 22 international PICUs.Family presence and no FP during TI in the PICU.The percentage of FP during TIs. First attempt success rate, adverse TI-associated events, multiple attempts (≥ 3), oxygen desaturation (oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry <80\%), and self-reported team stress level.A total of 4969 TI encounters were reported. Among those, 81\% (n = 4030) of TIs had documented FP status (with/without). The median age of participants with FP was 2 years and 1 year for those without FP. The average percentage of TIs with FP was 19\% and varied widely across sites (0\%-43\%; P < .001). Tracheal intubations with FP (vs without FP) were associated with older patients (median, 2 years vs 1 year; P = .04), lower Paediatric Index of Mortality 2 score, and pediatric resident as the first airway clinician (23\%, n = 179 vs 18\%, n = 584; odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.2-1.7). Tracheal intubations with FP and without FP were no different in the first attempt success rate (OR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.18), adverse TI-associated events (any events: OR, 1.06; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.30 and severe events: OR, 1.04; 95\% CI, 0.75-1.43), multiple attempts (≥ 3) (OR, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.82-1.28), oxygen desaturation (oxygen saturation <80\%) (OR, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.80-1.18), or self-reported team stress level (OR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.92-1.31). This result persisted after adjusting for patient and clinician confounders.Wide variability exists in FP during TIs across PICUs. Family presence was not associated with first attempt success, adverse TI-associated events, oxygen desaturation (<80\%), or higher team stress level. Our data suggest that FP during TI can safely be implemented as part of a family-centered care model in the PICU.},

	abstract = {In children with traumatic brain injury, 1) to describe the hospital discharge functional outcome and change from baseline function using the Functional Status Scale and 2) to determine any associations between discharge Functional Status Scale and age, injury mechanism, neurologic examination, imaging, and other predictors of outcome. Prospective observational cohort study, May 2013 to November 2015. Two U.S. children's hospitals designated as American College of Surgeons level 1 pediatric trauma centers. Children less than 18 years old admitted to an ICU with acute traumatic brain injury and either a surgical or critical care intervention within the first 24 hours or in-hospital mortality. None. The primary outcome was hospital discharge Functional Status Scale. Most, 133 of 196 (68%), had severe traumatic brain injury (admission Glasgow Coma Scale, 3-8). Overall hospital mortality was 14%; 20% among those with severe traumatic brain injury. Hospital discharge Functional Status Scale had an inverse relationship with Glasgow Coma Scale: for each increase in admission Glasgow Coma Scale by 1, the discharge Functional Status Scale decreased by 0.5 (95% CI, 0.7-0.3). Baseline Functional Status Scale was collected at one site (n = 75). At that site, nearly all (61/62) of the survivors had normal or near-normal (≤ 7) preinjury Functional Status Scale. More than one-third, 23 of 62 (37%), of survivors had new morbidity at hospital discharge (increase in Functional Status Scale, ≥ 3). Among children with severe traumatic brain injury who had baseline Functional Status Scale collected, 21 of 41 survivors (51%) had new morbidity at hospital discharge. The mean change in Functional Status Scale from baseline to hospital discharge was 3.9 $\pm$ 4.9 overall and 5.2 $\pm$ 5.4 in children with severe traumatic brain injury. More than one-third of survivors, and approximately half of survivors with severe traumatic brain injury, will have new morbidity. Hospital discharge Functional Status Scale, change from baseline Functional Status Scale, and new morbidity acquisition can be used as outcome measures for hospital-based care process improvement initiatives and interventional studies of children with traumatic brain injury.},

Prospective observational cohort study, May 2013 to September 2015. Two large U.S. children's hospitals with level 1 Pediatric Trauma Centers. One hundred seventy-four children less than 18 years old admitted to an ICU after traumatic brain injury. Prospective data were linked to database codes for each patient. The outcomes were prospectively identified acute traumatic brain injury, intracranial pressure monitor placement, craniotomy or craniectomy, vascular catheter placement, invasive mechanical ventilation, and new gastrostomy tube or tracheostomy placement. Candidate predictors were database codes present in administrative, billing, or trauma registry data. For each clinical event, we developed and validated penalized regression and Boolean classifiers (models to identify clinical events that take database codes as predictors). We externally validated the best model for each clinical event. The primary model performance measure was accuracy, the percent of test patients correctly classified. The cohort included 174 children who required ICU admission after traumatic brain injury. Simple Boolean classifiers were greater than or equal to 94% accurate for seven of nine clinical diagnoses and events. For central venous catheter placement, no classifier achieved 90% accuracy. Classifier accuracy was dependent on available data fields. Five of nine classifiers were acceptably accurate using only administrative data but three required trauma registry fields and two required billing data. In children with traumatic brain injury, computable phenotypes based on simple Boolean classifiers were highly accurate for most neurosurgical and critical care diagnoses and events. The computable phenotypes we developed and validated can be used in any observational study of children with traumatic brain injury and can reasonably be applied in studies of these interventions in other patient populations.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury causes substantial morbidity and mortality in children. Posttraumatic seizures may worsen outcomes after traumatic brain injury. Posttraumatic seizures risk factors are not completely understood. Our objective was to clarify posttraumatic seizures risk factors in a large cohort of children with severe traumatic brain injury. Retrospective cohort study of a probabilistically linked dataset from the National Trauma Data Bank and the Pediatric Health Information Systems database, 2007-2010. Twenty-nine U.S. children's hospitals. A total of 2,122 children (age, < 18 yr old at admission) with linked National Trauma Data Bank and Pediatric Health Information Systems records, severe (emergency department Glasgow Coma Scale, < 8) traumatic brain injury, hospital length of stay more than 24 hours, and nonmissing disposition. None. The outcome was posttraumatic seizures, identified using validated International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. Prespecified candidate predictors of posttraumatic seizures included age, injury mechanism, emergency department Glasgow Coma Scale, intracranial hemorrhage type, hypoxia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. Posttraumatic seizures were diagnosed in 25.2% of children with severe traumatic brain injury. In those without abuse/assault or subdural hemorrhage, the posttraumatic seizures rate varied between 36.6% in those less than 2 years old and 16.4% in those 14-17 years old. Age, abusive mechanism, and subdural hemorrhage are each significant predictors of posttraumatic seizures. The risk of posttraumatic seizures has a complex relationship with these predictors. The estimated odds of posttraumatic seizures decrease with advancing age, odds ratio equal to 0.929 (0.905-0.954) per additional year of age with no abuse/assault and no subdural hemorrhage; odds ratio equal to 0.820 (0.730-0.922) per additional year of age when abuse and subdural hemorrhage are present. An infant with accidental traumatic brain injury and subdural hemorrhage has approximately the same estimated probability of posttraumatic seizures as an abused infant without subdural hemorrhage (47% [95% CI, 39-55%] vs 50% [95% CI, 41-58%]; p = 0.69). The triad of young age, injury by abuse/assault, and subdural hemorrhage confers the greatest estimated probability for posttraumatic seizures (60% [95% CI, 53-66%]). Posttraumatic seizures risk in children with severe traumatic brain injury is greatest with a triad of younger age, injury by abuse/assault, and subdural hemorrhage. However, posttraumatic seizures are common even in the absence of these factors.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the ongoing mortality risk and healthcare utilization among U.S. children after discharge from a hospitalization involving ICU care. We sought to understand risks for hospital readmission and trends in mortality during the year following ICU discharge. Retrospective observational cohort study. This study was performed using administrative claims data from 2006-2013 obtained from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Database. We included all children in the dataset admitted to a U.S. ICU less than or equal to 18 years old. The primary outcome was nonelective readmission in the year following discharge. Risk of rehospitalization was determined using a Cox proportional hazards model. We identified 109,130 children with at least one ICU admission in the dataset. Over three quarters of the index ICU admissions (78.6%) had an ICU length of stay less than or equal to 3 days, and the overall index hospitalization mortality rate was 1.4%. In multivariate analysis, risk of nonelective readmission for children without cancer was higher with longer index ICU admission length of stay, younger age, and several chronic and acute conditions. By the end of the 1-year observation period, 36.0% of children with an index ICU length of stay greater than or equal to 14 days had been readmitted, compared with only 13.9% of children who had an index ICU length of stay equals to 1 day. Mortality in the year after ICU discharge was low overall (106 deaths per 10,000 person-years of observation) but was high among children with an initial index ICU admission length of stay greater than or equal to 14 days (599 deaths per 10,000 person-years). Readmission after ICU care is common. Further research is needed to investigate the potentially modifiable factors affecting likelihood of readmissions after discharge from the ICU. Although late mortality was relatively uncommon overall, it was 10-fold higher in the year after ICU discharge than in the general U.S. pediatric population.},

Post-traumatic seizures (PTS) occur in 11-42% of children with severe TBI and are associated with unfavorable outcome. Electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring may be used to detect PTS and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may be used to treat PTS, but national rates of EEG and AED use are not known. The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency and timing of EEG and AED use in children hospitalized after severe TBI. Retrospective cohort study of 2165 children at 30 hospitals in a probabilistically linked dataset from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) and the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database, 2007-2010. We included children (age <18 years old at admission) with linked NTDB and PHIS records, severe (Emergency Department [ED] Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] <8) TBI, hospital length of stay >24 h, and non-missing disposition. The primary outcomes were EEG and AED use. Overall, 31.8% of the cohort had EEG monitoring. Of those, 21.8% were monitored on the first hospital day. The median duration of EEG monitoring was 2.0 (IQR 1.0, 4.0) days. AEDs were prescribed to 52.0% of the cohort, of whom 61.8% received an AED on the first hospital day. The median duration of AED use was 8.0 (IQR 4.0, 17.0) days. EEG monitoring and AED use were more frequent in children with known risk factors for PTS. EEG monitoring and AED use were not related to hospital TBI volume. EEG use is relatively uncommon in children with severe TBI, but AEDs are frequently prescribed. EEG monitoring and AED use are more common in children with known risk factors for PTS.},

For each case, two controls presenting with influenza-like illness but without severe outcomes were included: one random control and one age matched control.Severe outcomes included death or admission to intensive care for assisted ventilation, inotropic support, or both. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to compare cases and controls, with effect sizes measured as adjusted odds ratios.151 (57\%) of the 265 cases were male, the median age was 6 (interquartile range 2.3-10.0) years, and 27 (10\%) died. Six factors were associated with severe outcomes in children presenting with influenza-like illness: history of chronic lung disease (odds ratio 10.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.5 to 69.8), history of cerebral palsy/developmental delay (10.2, 2.0 to 51.4), signs of chest retractions (9.6, 3.2 to 29.0), signs of dehydration (8.8, 1.6 to 49.3), requirement for oxygen (5.8, 2.0 to 16.2), and tachycardia relative to age).These independent risk factors may alert clinicians to children at risk of severe outcomes when presenting with influenza-like illness during future pandemics.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important worldwide cause of death and disability for children. The Approaches and Decisions for Acute Pediatric TBI (ADAPT) Trial is an observational, cohort study to compare the effectiveness of six aspects of TBI care. Understanding the differences between clinical sites-including their structure, clinical processes, and culture differences-will be necessary to assess differences in outcome from the study and can inform the overall community regarding differences across academic centers.We developed a survey and queried ADAPT site principal investigators with a focus on six domains: (i) hospital, (ii) pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), (iii) medical staff characteristics, (iv) quality of care, (v) medication safety, and (vi) safety culture. Summary statistics were used to describe differences between centers.ADAPT clinical sites that enrolled a subject within the first year (32 US-based, 11 international) were studied. A wide variation in site characteristics was observed in hospital and ICU characteristics, including an almost sevenfold range in ICU size (8-55 beds) and more than fivefold range of overall ICU admissions (537-2623). Nursing staffing (predominantly 1:1 or 1:2) and the presence of pharmacists within the ICU (79 \%) were less variable, and most sites "strongly agreed" or "agreed" that Neurosurgery and Critical Care teams worked well together (81.4 \%). However, a minority of sites (46 \%) used an explicit protocol for treatment of children with severe TBI care.We found a variety of inter-center structure, process, and culture differences. These intrinsic differences between sites may begin to explain why interventional studies have failed to prove efficacy of experimental therapies. Understanding these differences may be an important factor in analyzing future ADAPT trial results and in determining best practices for pediatric severe TBI.},

Multicenter (n = 107 PICUs) and multinational (23 countries, 79% in North America and Europe). Children 7 days to 17 years old admitted to the ICU with new traumatic brain injury, stroke, cardiac arrest, CNS infection or inflammation, status epilepticus, spinal cord injury, hydrocephalus, or brain mass. None. We evaluated the prevalence and outcomes of children with predetermined acute neurologic insults. Child and center characteristics were recorded. Unfavorable outcome was defined as change in pre-post insult Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score greater than or equal to 2 or death at hospital discharge or 3 months, whichever came first. Screening data yielded overall prevalence of 16.2%. Of 924 children with acute neurologic insults, cardiac arrest (23%) and traumatic brain injury (19%) were the most common. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge was 12%. Cardiac arrest subjects had highest mortality (24%), and traumatic brain injury subjects had the most unfavorable outcomes (49%). The most common neurologic insult was infection/inflammation in South America, Asia, and the single African site but cardiac arrest in the remaining regions. Neurologic insults are a significant pediatric international health issue. They are frequent and contribute substantial morbidity and mortality. These data suggest a need for an increased focus on acute critical neurologic diseases in infants and children including additional research, enhanced availability of clinical resources, and the development of new therapies.},

	abstract = {Small series have suggested that outcomes after abusive head trauma are less favorable than after other injury mechanisms. We sought to determine the impact of abusive head trauma on mortality and identify factors that differentiate children with abusive head trauma from those with traumatic brain injury from other mechanisms. First 200 subjects from the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Trial-a comparative effectiveness study using an observational, cohort study design. PICUs in tertiary children's hospitals in United States and abroad. Consecutive children (age < 18 yr) with severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8; intracranial pressure monitoring). None. Demographics, injury-related scores, prehospital, and resuscitation events were analyzed. Children were dichotomized based on likelihood of abusive head trauma. A total of 190 children were included (n = 35 with abusive head trauma). Abusive head trauma subjects were younger (1.87 $\pm$ 0.32 vs 9.23 $\pm$ 0.39 yr; p < 0.001) and a greater proportion were female (54.3% vs 34.8%; p = 0.032). Abusive head trauma were more likely to 1) be transported from home (60.0% vs 33.5%; p < 0.001), 2) have apnea (34.3% vs 12.3%; p = 0.002), and 3) have seizures (28.6% vs 7.7%; p < 0.001) during prehospital care. Abusive head trauma had a higher prevalence of seizures during resuscitation (31.4 vs 9.7%; p = 0.002). After adjusting for covariates, there was no difference in mortality (abusive head trauma, 25.7% vs nonabusive head trauma, 18.7%; hazard ratio, 1.758; p = 0.60). A similar proportion died due to refractory intracranial hypertension in each group (abusive head trauma, 66.7% vs nonabusive head trauma, 69.0%). In this large, multicenter series, children with abusive head trauma had differences in prehospital and in-hospital secondary injuries which could have therapeutic implications. Unlike other traumatic brain injury populations in children, female predominance was seen in abusive head trauma in our cohort. Similar mortality rates and refractory intracranial pressure deaths suggest that children with severe abusive head trauma may benefit from therapies including invasive monitoring and adherence to evidence-based guidelines.},

	abstract = {Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is a mainstay of therapy for children with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its overall association with patient outcome is unclear. To test the hypothesis that ICP monitoring is associated with improved functional survival of children with severe TBI. A propensity-weighted effectiveness analysis was conducted using 2 linked national databases with data from 30 US children's hospitals from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2012, on 3084 children with severe TBI. Clinical events including neurosurgical procedures were identified using validated computable phenotypes. Data analysis was conducted from September 1, 2016, to March 1, 2017. Placement of an ICP monitor. A composite of hospital mortality, discharge to hospice, or survival with placement of new tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes. Of the 3084 children in the study (1128 girls and 1956 boys; mean [SD] age, 7.03 [5.44] years), 1002 (32.4%) underwent ICP monitoring, with substantial hospital variation (6% to 50% by hospital). Overall, 484 children (15.7%) experienced the primary composite outcome. A propensity approach using matching weights generated good covariate balance between those who did and those who did not undergo ICP monitoring. Using a propensity-weighted logistic regression model clustered by hospital, no statistically significant difference was found in functional survival between monitored and unmonitored patients (odds ratio of poor outcome among those who underwent ICP monitoring, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.99-1.74). In a prespecified secondary analysis, no difference in mortality was found (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.89-1.50). Prespecified subgroup analyses of children younger and older than 2 years of age and among those with unintentional and inflicted (intentional) injuries also showed no difference in outcome with ICP monitoring. With the use of linked national data and validated computable phenotypes, no evidence was found of a benefit from ICP monitoring on functional survival of children with severe TBI. Intracranial pressure monitoring is a widely but inconsistently used technology with incompletely demonstrated effectiveness. A large prospective cohort study or randomized trial is needed.},
