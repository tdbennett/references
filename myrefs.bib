@article{Stroh2024,
	abstract = {Refined management of mechanically ventilation is an obvious target for improving patient outcomes, but is impeded by the nature of data for study and hypothesis generation. The connections between clinical outcomes and temporal development of iatrogenic injuries current lung-protective ventilator settings remain poorly understood. Analysis of lung-ventilator system (LVS) evolution at relevant timescales is frustrated by data volume and multiple sources of heterogeneity. This work motivates, presents, and validates a computational pipeline for resolving LVS systems into the joint evolution of data-conditioned model parameters and ventilator information. Applied to individuals, the workflow yields a concise low-dimensional representation of LVS behavior expressed in phenotypic breath waveforms suitable for analysis. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through application to multi-day observational series of 35 patients. Individual patient analyses reveal multiple types of patient-oriented dynamics and breath behavior to expose the complexity of LVS evolution; less than 10% of phenotype changes related to ventilator settings changes. Dynamics are shown to including both stable and unstable phenotype transitions as well as both discrete and continuous changes unrelated to ventilator settings. At a cohort scale, 721 phenotypes constructed from individual data are condensed into a set of 16 groups that empirically organize around certain settings (positive end-expository pressure and ventilator mode) and structurally similar pressure-volume loop characterizations. Individual and cohort scale phenotypes, which may be refined by hypothesis-specific constructions, provide a common framework for ongoing temporal analysis and investigation of LVS dynamics.},

@article{Menon2023,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Standardized, consistent reporting of social determinants of health (SDOH) in studies on children with sepsis would allow for: 1) understanding the association of SDOH with illness severity and outcomes, 2) comparing populations and extrapolating study results, and 3) identification of potentially modifiable socioeconomic factors for policy makers. We, therefore, sought to determine how frequently data on SDOH were reported, which factors were collected and how these factors were defined in studies of sepsis in children.
DATA SOURCES AND SELECTION: We reviewed 106 articles (published between 2005 and 2020) utilized in a recent systematic review on physiologic criteria for pediatric sepsis.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by two reviewers on variables that fell within the World Health Organization's SDOH categories.
DATA SYNTHESIS: SDOH were not the primary outcome in any of the included studies. Seventeen percent of articles (18/106) did not report on any SDOH, and a further 36.8% (39/106) only reported on gender/sex. Of the remaining 46.2% of articles, the most reported SDOH categories were preadmission nutritional status (35.8%, 38/106) and race/ethnicity (18.9%, 20/106). However, no two studies used the same definition of the variables reported within each of these categories. Six studies reported on socioeconomic status (3.8%, 6/106), including two from upper-middle-income and four from lower middle-income countries. Only three studies reported on parental education levels (2.8%, 3/106). No study reported on parental job security or structural conflict.
CONCLUSIONS: We found overall low reporting of SDOH and marked variability in categorizations and definitions of SDOH variables. Consistent and standardized reporting of SDOH in pediatric sepsis studies is needed to understand the role these factors play in the development and severity of sepsis, to compare and extrapolate study results between settings and to implement policies aimed at improving socioeconomic conditions related to sepsis.},

@article{Pfaff2023,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Naming a newly discovered disease is a difficult process; in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the existence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), which includes long COVID, it has proven especially challenging. Disease definitions and assignment of a diagnosis code are often asynchronous and iterative. The clinical definition and our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID are still in flux, and the deployment of an ICD-10-CM code for long COVID in the USA took nearly 2 years after patients had begun to describe their condition. Here, we leverage the largest publicly available HIPAA-limited dataset about patients with COVID-19 in the US to examine the heterogeneity of adoption and use of U09.9, the ICD-10-CM code for "Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified."
METHODS: We undertook a number of analyses to characterize the N3C population with a U09.9 diagnosis code (n = 33,782), including assessing person-level demographics and a number of area-level social determinants of health; diagnoses commonly co-occurring with U09.9, clustered using the Louvain algorithm; and quantifying medications and procedures recorded within 60 days of U09.9 diagnosis. We stratified all analyses by age group in order to discern differing patterns of care across the lifespan.
RESULTS: We established the diagnoses most commonly co-occurring with U09.9 and algorithmically clustered them into four major categories: cardiopulmonary, neurological, gastrointestinal, and comorbid conditions. Importantly, we discovered that the population of patients diagnosed with U09.9 is demographically skewed toward female, White, non-Hispanic individuals, as well as individuals living in areas with low poverty and low unemployment. Our results also include a characterization of common procedures and medications associated with U09.9-coded patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This work offers insight into potential subtypes and current practice patterns around long COVID and speaks to the existence of disparities in the diagnosis of patients with long COVID. This latter finding in particular requires further research and urgent remediation.},

@article{Mandel2023,
	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with more severe acute coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. We assessed OSA as a potential risk factor for Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC).
METHODS: We assessed the impact of preexisting OSA on the risk for probable PASC in adults and children using electronic health record data from multiple research networks. Three research networks within the REsearching COVID to Enhance Recovery initiative (PCORnet Adult, PCORnet Pediatric, and the National COVID Cohort Collaborative [N3C]) employed a harmonized analytic approach to examine the risk of probable PASC in COVID-19-positive patients with and without a diagnosis of OSA prior to pandemic onset. Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated as well as ORs adjusted for age group, sex, race/ethnicity, hospitalization status, obesity, and preexisting comorbidities.
RESULTS: Across networks, the unadjusted OR for probable PASC associated with a preexisting OSA diagnosis in adults and children ranged from 1.41 to 3.93. Adjusted analyses found an attenuated association that remained significant among adults only. Multiple sensitivity analyses with expanded inclusion criteria and covariates yielded results consistent with the primary analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Adults with preexisting OSA were found to have significantly elevated odds of probable PASC. This finding was consistent across data sources, approaches for identifying COVID-19-positive patients, and definitions of PASC. Patients with OSA may be at elevated risk for PASC after SARS-CoV-2 infection and should be monitored for post-acute sequelae.},

@article{Leese2023,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinical encounter data are heterogeneous and vary greatly from institution to institution. These problems of variance affect interpretability and usability of clinical encounter data for analysis. These problems are magnified when multisite electronic health record (EHR) data are networked together. This article presents a novel, generalizable method for resolving encounter heterogeneity for analysis by combining related atomic encounters into composite "macrovisits."
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Encounters were composed of data from 75 partner sites harmonized to a common data model as part of the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery Initiative, a project of the National Covid Cohort Collaborative. Summary statistics were computed for overall and site-level data to assess issues and identify modifications. Two algorithms were developed to refine atomic encounters into cleaner, analyzable longitudinal clinical visits.
RESULTS: Atomic inpatient encounters data were found to be widely disparate between sites in terms of length-of-stay (LOS) and numbers of OMOP CDM measurements per encounter. After aggregating encounters to macrovisits, LOS and measurement variance decreased. A subsequent algorithm to identify hospitalized macrovisits further reduced data variability.
DISCUSSION: Encounters are a complex and heterogeneous component of EHR data and native data issues are not addressed by existing methods. These types of complex and poorly studied issues contribute to the difficulty of deriving value from EHR data, and these types of foundational, large-scale explorations, and developments are necessary to realize the full potential of modern real-world data.
CONCLUSION: This article presents method developments to manipulate and resolve EHR encounter data issues in a generalizable way as a foundation for future research and analysis.},

@article{Spear2023,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Long-term outcomes after pediatric neurocritical illness are poorly characterized. This study aims to characterize the frequency and risk factors for post-discharge unplanned health resource use in a pediatric neurocritical care population using insurance claims data.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study evaluating children who survived a hospitalization for an acute neurologic illness or injury requiring mechanical ventilation for >72 hours and had insurance eligibility in Colorado's All Payers Claims database. Insurance claims identified unplanned readmissions and emergency department [ED] visits during the post-discharge year. For patients without pre-existing epilepsy/seizures, we evaluated for post-ICU epilepsy identified by claim(s) for a maintenance anti-seizure medication during months 6-12 post-discharge. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with each outcome.
RESULTS: 101 children, median age 3.7 years (interquartile range (IQR) .4-11.9), admitted for trauma (57%), hypoxic-ischemic injury (17%) and seizures (15%). During the post-discharge year, 4 (4%) patients died, 26 (26%) were readmitted, and 48 (48%) had an ED visit. Having a pre-existing complex chronic condition was independently associated with readmission and emergency department visit. Admission for trauma was protective against readmission. Of those without pre-existing seizures (n = 86), 25 (29%) developed post-ICU epilepsy. Acute seizures during admission and prolonged ICU stays were independently associated with post-ICU epilepsy.
CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of pediatric neurocritical illness are at risk of unplanned healthcare use and post-ICU epilepsy. Critical illness risk factors including prolonged ICU stay and acute seizures may identify cohorts for targeted follow up or interventions to prevent unplanned healthcare use and post-ICU epilepsy.},

@article{Sullivan2023,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Timely surgical decompression improves functional outcomes and survival among children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and increased intracranial pressure. Previous scoring systems for identifying the need for surgical decompression after TBI in children and adults have had several barriers to use. These barriers include the inability to generate a score with missing data, a requirement for radiographic imaging that may not be immediately available, and limited accuracy. To address these limitations, we developed a Bayesian network to predict the probability of neurosurgical intervention among injured children and adolescents (age 1 to 18 years) using physical exam findings and injury characteristics observable at hospital arrival.
METHODS: We obtained patient, injury, transportation, resuscitation, and procedure characteristics from the 2017 to 2019 Trauma Quality Improvement Project database. We trained and validated a Bayesian network to predict the probability of a neurosurgical intervention, defined as undergoing a craniotomy, craniectomy, or intracranial pressure monitor placement. We evaluated model performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and calibration curves. We evaluated the percentage of contribution of each input for predicting neurosurgical intervention using relative mutual information (RMI).
RESULTS: The final model included four predictor variables, including the Glasgow Coma Scale score (RMI 31.9%), pupillary response (RMI 11.6%), mechanism of injury (RMI 5.8%), and presence of prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (RMI 0.8%). The model achieved an AUROC curve of 0.90 (95% CI 0.89, 0.91) and had a calibration slope of 0.77 (95% CI 0.29, 1.26) with a y-intercept of 0.05 (95% CI -0.14, 0.25).
CONCLUSION: We developed a Bayesian network that predicts neurosurgical intervention for all injured children using four factors immediately available on arrival. Compared to a binary threshold model, this probabilistic model may allow clinicians to stratify management strategies based on risk.

	abstract = {Sepsis is a leading cause of global mortality in children, yet definitions for pediatric sepsis are outdated and lack global applicability and validity. In adults, the Sepsis-3 Definition Taskforce queried databases from high-income countries to develop and validate the criteria. The merit of this definition has been widely acknowledged; however, important considerations about less-resourced and more diverse settings pose challenges to its use globally. To improve applicability and relevance globally, the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce sought to develop a conceptual framework and rationale of the critical aspects and context-specific factors that must be considered for the optimal operationalization of future pediatric sepsis definitions. It is important to address challenges in developing a set of pediatric sepsis criteria which capture manifestations of illnesses with vastly different etiologies and underlying mechanisms. Ideal criteria need to be unambiguous, and capable of adapting to the different contexts in which children with suspected infections are present around the globe. Additionally, criteria need to facilitate early recognition and timely escalation of treatment to prevent progression and limit life-threatening organ dysfunction. To address these challenges, locally adaptable solutions are required, which permit individualized care based on available resources and the pretest probability of sepsis. This should facilitate affordable diagnostics which support risk stratification and prediction of likely treatment responses, and solutions for locally relevant outcome measures. For this purpose, global collaborative databases need to be established, using minimum variable datasets from routinely collected data. In summary, a "Think globally, act locally" approach is required.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Bebtelovimab is an anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody active against Omicron lineage variants authorized to treat high-risk outpatients with COVID-19. We sought to determine the real-world effectiveness of bebtelovimab during the Omicron phases BA.2/BA2.12.1/BA4/BA5.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 6 and October 11, 2022, using health records linked to vaccine and mortality data. We used propensity scores to match of bebtelovimab-treated with untreated outpatients. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause hospitalization. The secondary outcomes were 28-day COVID-19-related hospitalization, 28-day all-cause mortality, 28-day emergency department visits, maximum respiratory support level, intensive care unit admission, and in-hospital mortality among hospitalized patients. We used logistic regression to determine bebtelovimab treatment effectiveness.
RESULTS: Among 22,720 patients with SARS-COV-2 infection, 3739 bebtelovimab-treated patients were matched to 5423 untreated patients. Compared with no treatment, bebtelovimab was associated with lower odds of 28-day all-cause hospitalization (1.3% vs 2.1%, adjusted odds ratio: 0.53; 95% confidence interval: 0.37-0.74, P <0.001), as well as COVID-19-related hospitalization (1.0% vs 2.0%, adjusted odds ratio: 0.44 [95% confidence interval: 0.30-0.64], P <0.001). Bebtelovimab appeared to be more beneficial in lowering the odds of hospitalization among patients with two or more comorbidities (interaction P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: During the Omicron BA.2/BA.2.12.1/BA.4/BA.5 variant phase, bebtelovimab was associated with lower hospitalization.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were authorized for the treatment of COVID-19 outpatients based on clinical trials completed early in the pandemic, which were underpowered for mortality and subgroup analyses. Real-world data studies are promising for further assessing rapidly deployed therapeutics.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Did mAb treatment prevent progression to severe disease and death across pandemic phases and based on risk factors, including prior vaccination status?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This observational cohort study included nonhospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from November 2020 to October 2021 using electronic health records from a statewide health system plus state-level vaccine and mortality data. Using propensity matching, we selected approximately 2.5 patients not receiving mAbs for each patient who received mAb treatment under emergency use authorization. The primary outcome was 28-day hospitalization; secondary outcomes included mortality and hospitalization severity.
RESULTS: Of 36,077 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2,675 receiving mAbs were matched to 6,677 patients not receiving mAbs. Compared with mAb-untreated patients, mAb-treated patients had lower all-cause hospitalization (4.0% vs 7.7%; adjusted OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.38-0.60) and all-cause mortality (0.1% vs 0.9%; adjusted OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03-0.29) to day 28; differences persisted to day 90. Among hospitalized patients, mAb-treated patients had shorter hospital length of stay (5.8 vs 8.5 days) and lower risk of mechanical ventilation (4.6% vs 16.6%). Results were similar for preventing hospitalizations during the Delta variant phase (adjusted OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.25-0.50) and across subgroups. Number-needed-to-treat (NNT) to prevent hospitalization was lower for subgroups with higher baseline risk of hospitalization; for example, multiple comorbidities (NNT = 17) and not fully vaccinated (NNT = 24) vs no comorbidities (NNT = 88) and fully vaccinated (NNT = 81).
INTERPRETATION: Real-world data revealed a strong association between receipt of mAbs and reduced hospitalization and deaths among COVID-19 outpatients across pandemic phases. Real-world data studies should be used to guide practice and policy decisions, including allocation of scarce resources.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate the clinical characteristics, ventilator settings, and gas exchange indices of patients placed on high-frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV) and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). Methods Retrospective observation of all consecutive patients aged 0 to 18 years with acute respiratory failure managed with high-frequency ventilation from the institution's introduction of HFPV on May 1, 2012, until July 10, 2013. Measurements and Main Results Twenty-seven patients underwent HFPV as a first mode of high-frequency ventilation and 16 patients underwent HFOV first. HFPV was used more frequently in patients with acute respiratory illnesses (p < 0.01), lower Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 scores (rank-sum p < 0.04), higher Spo 2/Fio 2 (SF) ratios (p < 0.01), and lower oxygen saturation indices (p < 0.01). HFPV patients showed increased SF ratios (p < 0.01) and decreased Paco 2 levels (p = 0.02) 6 hours after initiation, and HFOV patients showed no significant differences. Peak inspiratory pressures (HFPV) and mean airway pressures (HFOV) remained at or below 30 cm H2O at each time point. HFPV and HFOV patients had an average of 2.8 and 2.9 mode changes, respectively. Mortality was 15% in the HFPV group and 50% in the HFOV group. Conclusions HFPV is associated with rapid improvement in oxygenation and ventilation at acceptable airway pressures in patients with acute respiratory failure of various etiologies, primarily for those with difficulties of ventilation or secretion management. In our institution, HFOV appears to be initiated first in children with higher severity of illness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nirmatrelvir is a protease inhibitor with in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir can reduce the risk of progression to severe COVID-19 among individuals at high risk infected with delta and early omicron variants. However, less is known about the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir during more recent BA.2, BA2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 omicron variant surges. We used our real-world data platform to evaluate the effect of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment on 28-day hospitalisation, mortality, and emergency department visits among outpatients with early symptomatic COVID-19 during a SARS-CoV-2 omicron (BA.2, BA2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5) predominant period in Colorado, USA.
METHODS: We did a propensity-matched, retrospective, observational cohort study of non-hospitalised adult patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 between March 26 and Aug 25, 2022, using records from a statewide health system in Colorado. We obtained data from the electronic health records of University of Colorado Health, the largest health system in Colorado, with 13 hospitals and 141 000 annual hospital admissions, and with numerous ambulatory sites and affiliated pharmacies around the state. Included patients had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir medication order. Exclusion criteria were an order for or administration of other SARS-CoV-2 treatments within 10 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, hospitalisation at the time of positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and positive SARS-CoV-2 test more than 10 days before a nirmatrelvir-ritonavir order. We propensity score matched patients treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir with untreated patients. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause hospitalisation.
FINDINGS: Among 28 167 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 between March 26 and Aug 25, 2022, 21 493 met the study inclusion criteria. 9881 patients received treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 11 612 were untreated. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment was associated with reduced 28-day all-cause hospitalisation compared with no antiviral treatment (61 [0·9%] of 7168 patients vs 135 [1·4%] of 9361 patients, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0·45 [95% CI 0·33-0·62]; p<0·0001). Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment was also associated with reduced 28-day all-cause mortality (two [<0·1%] of 7168 patients vs 15 [0·2%] of 9361 patients; adjusted OR 0·15 [95% CI 0·03-0·50]; p=0·0010). Using subsequent emergency department visits as a surrogate for clinically significant relapse, we observed a decrease after nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment (283 [3·9%] of 7168 patients vs 437 [4·7%] of 9361 patients; adjusted OR 0·74 [95% CI 0·63-0·87]; p=0·0002).
INTERPRETATION: Real-world evidence reported during a BA.2, BA2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 omicron surge showed an association between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment and reduced 28-day all-cause hospitalisation, all-cause mortality, and visits to the emergency department. With results that are among the first to suggest effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for non-hospitalised patients during an omicron period inclusive of BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, these data support nirmatrelvir-ritonavir as an ongoing first-line treatment for adults acutely infected with SARS-CoV-2.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is responsible for a substantial proportion of global childhood morbidity and mortality. However, evidence demonstrates major inaccuracies in the use of the term "sepsis" in clinical practice, coding, and research. Current and previous definitions of sepsis have been developed using expert consensus but the specific criteria used to identify children with sepsis have not been rigorously evaluated. Therefore, as part of the Society of Critical Care Medicine's Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce, we will conduct a systematic review to synthesize evidence on individual factors, clinical criteria, or illness severity scores that may be used to identify children with infection who have or are at high risk of developing sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and separately those factors, criteria, and scores that may be used to identify children with sepsis who are at high risk of progressing to multiple organ dysfunction or death.
DATA SOURCES: We will identify eligible studies by searching the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.
STUDY SELECTION: We will include all randomized trials and cohort studies published between January 1, 2004, and March 16, 2020.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction will include information related to study characteristics, population characteristics, clinical criteria, and outcomes.
DATA SYNTHESIS: We will calculate sensitivity and specificity of each criterion for predicting sepsis and conduct a meta-analysis if the data allow. We will also provide pooled estimates of overall hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The potential risk factors, clinical criteria, and illness severity scores from this review which identify patients with infection who are at high risk of developing sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and/or progressing to multiple organ dysfunction or death will be used to inform the next steps of the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce.},

METHODS: In an observational cohort study of nonhospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 1 October 2021-11 December 2021, using electronic health records from a statewide health system plus state-level vaccine and mortality data, we used propensity matching to select 3 patients not receiving mAbs for each patient who received outpatient sotrovimab treatment.

RESULTS: Of 10 036 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 522 receiving sotrovimab were matched to 1563 not receiving mAbs. Compared to mAb-untreated patients, sotrovimab treatment was associated with a 63% decrease in the odds of all-cause hospitalization (raw rate 2.1% vs 5.7%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], .19-.66) and an 89% decrease in the odds of all-cause 28-day mortality (raw rate 0% vs 1.0%; aOR, 0.11; 95% CI, .0-.79), and may reduce respiratory disease severity among those hospitalized.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are highly effective in reducing hospitalization and mortality among early symptomatic COVID-19 patients in clinical trials and real-world data. While resistance to some mAbs has since emerged among new variants, characteristics associated with treatment failure of mAbs remain unknown.
METHODS: This multicenter, observational cohort study included patients with COVID-19 who received mAb treatment between November 20, 2020, and December 9, 2021. We utilized electronic health records from a statewide health system plus state-level vaccine and mortality data. The primary outcome was mAb treatment failure, defined as hospitalization or death within 28 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.
RESULTS: COVID-19 mAb was administered to 7406 patients. Hospitalization within 28 days of positive SARS-CoV-2 test occurred in 258 (3.5%) of all patients who received mAb treatment. Ten patients (0.1%) died within 28 days, and all but one were hospitalized prior to death. Characteristics associated with treatment failure included having two or more comorbidities excluding obesity and immunocompromised status (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.52-5.56), lack of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (OR 2.73, 95% CI 2.01-3.77), non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.20-3.82), obesity (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.36-2.34), one comorbidity (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.11-2.57), age ≥ 65 years (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.13-2.35), and male sex (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.02). Immunocompromised status (none, mild, or moderate/severe), pandemic phase, and type of mAb received were not associated with treatment failure (all p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities, lack of prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, obesity, age ≥ 65 years, and male sex are associated with treatment failure of mAbs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were authorized for the treatment of COVID-19 outpatients based on clinical trials completed early in the pandemic, which were underpowered for mortality and subgroup analyses. Real-world data studies are promising for further assessing rapidly deployed therapeutics.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Did mAb treatment prevent progression to severe disease and death across pandemic phases and based on risk factors, including prior vaccination status?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This observational cohort study included nonhospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from November 2020 to October 2021 using electronic health records from a statewide health system plus state-level vaccine and mortality data. Using propensity matching, we selected approximately 2.5 patients not receiving mAbs for each patient who received mAb treatment under emergency use authorization. The primary outcome was 28-day hospitalization; secondary outcomes included mortality and hospitalization severity.
RESULTS: Of 36,077 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2,675 receiving mAbs were matched to 6,677 patients not receiving mAbs. Compared with mAb-untreated patients, mAb-treated patients had lower all-cause hospitalization (4.0% vs 7.7%; adjusted OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.38-0.60) and all-cause mortality (0.1% vs 0.9%; adjusted OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03-0.29) to day 28; differences persisted to day 90. Among hospitalized patients, mAb-treated patients had shorter hospital length of stay (5.8 vs 8.5 days) and lower risk of mechanical ventilation (4.6% vs 16.6%). Results were similar for preventing hospitalizations during the Delta variant phase (adjusted OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.25-0.50) and across subgroups. Number-needed-to-treat (NNT) to prevent hospitalization was lower for subgroups with higher baseline risk of hospitalization; for example, multiple comorbidities (NNT = 17) and not fully vaccinated (NNT = 24) vs no comorbidities (NNT = 88) and fully vaccinated (NNT = 81).
INTERPRETATION: Real-world data revealed a strong association between receipt of mAbs and reduced hospitalization and deaths among COVID-19 outpatients across pandemic phases. Real-world data studies should be used to guide practice and policy decisions, including allocation of scarce resources.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Definitions for pediatric sepsis were established in 2005 without data-driven criteria. It is unknown whether the more recent adult Sepsis-3 definitions meet the needs of providers caring for children. We aimed to explore the use and applicability of criteria to diagnose sepsis and septic shock in children across the world.
METHODS: This is an international electronic survey of clinicians distributed across international and national societies representing pediatric intensive care, emergency medicine, pediatrics, and pediatric infectious diseases. Respondents stated their preferences on a 5-point Likert scale.
RESULTS: There were 2835 survey responses analyzed, of which 48% originated from upper-middle income countries, followed by high income countries (38%) and low or lower-middle income countries (14%). Abnormal vital signs, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and microbiologic diagnoses were the criteria most used for the diagnosis of "sepsis." The 2005 consensus definitions were perceived to be the most useful for sepsis recognition, while Sepsis-3 definitions were stated as more useful for benchmarking, disease classification, enrollment into trials, and prognostication. The World Health Organization definitions were perceived as least useful across all domains. Seventy one percent of respondents agreed that the term sepsis should be restricted to children with infection-associated organ dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians around the world apply a myriad of signs, symptoms, laboratory studies, and treatment factors when diagnosing sepsis. The concept of sepsis as infection with associated organ dysfunction is broadly supported. Currently available sepsis definitions fall short of the perceived needs. Future diagnostic algorithms should be pragmatic and sensitive to the clinical settings.},

	abstract = {Importance: The postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) has emerged as a long-term complication in adults, but current understanding of the clinical presentation of PASC in children is limited.
Objective: To identify diagnosed symptoms, diagnosed health conditions, and medications associated with PASC in children.
Design, Setting and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used electronic health records from 9 US children's hospitals for individuals younger than 21 years who underwent antigen or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1, 2020, and October 31, 2021, and had at least 1 encounter in the 3 years before testing.
Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 positivity by viral test (antigen or RT-PCR).
Main Outcomes and Measures: Syndromic (symptoms), systemic (conditions), and medication PASC features were identified in the 28 to 179 days following the initial test date. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were obtained for 151 clinically predicted PASC features by contrasting viral test-positive groups with viral test-negative groups using proportional hazards models, adjusting for site, age, sex, testing location, race and ethnicity, and time period of cohort entrance. The incidence proportion for any syndromic, systemic, or medication PASC feature was estimated in the 2 groups to obtain a burden of PASC estimate.
Results: Among 659 286 children in the study sample, 348 091 (52.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 8.1 (5.7) years. A total of 59 893 (9.1%) tested positive by viral test for SARS-CoV-2, and 599 393 (90.9%) tested negative. Most were tested in outpatient testing facility settings (322 813 [50.3%]) or office settings (162 138 [24.6%]). The most common syndromic, systemic, and medication features were loss of taste or smell (aHR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.16-3.32), myocarditis (aHR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.94-4.96), and cough and cold preparations (aHR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.18-1.96), respectively. The incidence of at least 1 systemic, syndromic, or medication feature of PASC was 41.9% (95% CI, 41.4-42.4) among viral test-positive children vs 38.2% (95% CI, 38.1-38.4) among viral test-negative children, with an incidence proportion difference of 3.7% (95% CI, 3.2-4.2). A higher strength of association for PASC was identified in those cared for in the intensive care unit during the acute illness phase, children younger than 5 years, and individuals with complex chronic conditions.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this large-scale, exploratory study, the burden of pediatric PASC that presented to health systems was low. Myocarditis was the most commonly diagnosed PASC-associated condition. Acute illness severity, young age, and comorbid complex chronic disease increased the risk of PASC.},

	abstract = {Importance: Diversion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been used for decades as a treatment for children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is recommended by evidenced-based guidelines. However, these recommendations are based on limited studies.
Objective: To determine whether CSF diversion is associated with improved Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended for Pediatrics (GOS-EP) and decreased intracranial pressure (ICP) in children with severe TBI.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This observational comparative effectiveness study was performed at 51 clinical centers that routinely care for children with severe TBI in 8 countries (US, United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India) from February 2014 to September 2017, with follow-up at 6 months after injury (final follow-up, October 22, 2021). Children with severe TBI were included if they had Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 8 or lower, had intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor placed on-site, and were aged younger than 18 years. Children were excluded if they were pregnant or an ICP monitor was not placed at the study site. Consecutive children were screened and enrolled, data regarding treatments were collected, and at discharge, consent was obtained for outcomes testing. Propensity matching for pretreatment characteristics was performed to develop matched pairs for primary analysis. Data analyses were completed on April 18, 2022.
Exposures: Clinical care followed local standards, including the use of CSF diversion (or not), with patients stratified at the time of ICP monitor placement (CSF group vs no CSF group).
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was GOS-EP at 6 months, while ICP was considered as a secondary outcome. CSF vs no CSF was treated as an intention-to-treat analysis, and a sensitivity analysis was performed for children who received delayed CSF diversion.
Results: A total of 1000 children with TBI were enrolled, including 314 who received CSF diversion (mean [SD] age, 7.18 [5.45] years; 208 [66.2%] boys) and 686 who did not (mean [SD] age, 7.79 [5.33] years; 437 [63.7%] boys). The propensity-matched analysis included 98 pairs. In propensity score-matched analyses, there was no difference between groups in GOS-EP (median [IQR] difference, 0 [-3 to 1]; P = .08), but there was a decrease in overall ICP in the CSF group (mean [SD] difference, 3.97 [0.12] mm Hg; P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness study, CSF diversion was not associated with improved outcome at 6 months after TBI, but a decrease in ICP was observed. Given the higher quality of evidence generated by this study, current evidence-based guidelines related to CSF diversion should be reconsidered.},

@article{Martin2022sbi,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Serious bacterial infection (SBI) is common in the PICU. Antibiotics can mitigate associated morbidity and mortality but have associated adverse effects. Our objective is to develop machine learning models able to identify SBI-negative children and reduce unnecessary antibiotics.
METHODS: We developed models to predict SBI-negative status at PICU admission using vital sign, laboratory, and demographic variables. Children 3-months to 18-years-old admitted to our PICU, between 2011 and 2020, were included if evaluated for infection within 24-hours, stratified by documented antibiotic exposure in the 48-hours prior. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was the primary model accuracy measure; secondarily, we calculated the number of SBI-negative children subsequently provided antibiotics in the PICU identified as low-risk by each model.
RESULTS: A total of 15 074 children met inclusion criteria; 4788 (32%) received antibiotics before PICU admission. Of these antibiotic-exposed patients, 2325 of 4788 (49%) had an SBI. Of the 10 286 antibiotic-unexposed patients, 2356 of 10 286 (23%) had an SBI. In antibiotic-exposed children, a radial support vector machine model had the highest AUROC (0.80) for evaluating SBI, identifying 48 of 442 (11%) SBI-negative children provided antibiotics in the PICU who could have been spared a median 3.7 (interquartile range 0.9-9.0) antibiotic-days per patient. In antibiotic-unexposed children, a random forest model performed best, but was less accurate overall (AUROC 0.76), identifying 33 of 469 (7%) SBI-negative children provided antibiotics in the PICU who could have been spared 1.1 (interquartile range 0.9-3.7) antibiotic-days per patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Among children who received antibiotics before PICU admission, machine learning models can identify children at low risk of SBI and potentially reduce antibiotic exposure.},

@article{Pfaff2022,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, known as long COVID, have severely affected recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic for patients and society alike. Long COVID is characterised by evolving, heterogeneous symptoms, making it challenging to derive an unambiguous definition. Studies of electronic health records are a crucial element of the US National Institutes of Health's RECOVER Initiative, which is addressing the urgent need to understand long COVID, identify treatments, and accurately identify who has it-the latter is the aim of this study.
METHODS: Using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative's (N3C) electronic health record repository, we developed XGBoost machine learning models to identify potential patients with long COVID. We defined our base population (n=1 793 604) as any non-deceased adult patient (age ≥18 years) with either an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification COVID-19 diagnosis code (U07.1) from an inpatient or emergency visit, or a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test, and for whom at least 90 days have passed since COVID-19 index date. We examined demographics, health-care utilisation, diagnoses, and medications for 97 995 adults with COVID-19. We used data on these features and 597 patients from a long COVID clinic to train three machine learning models to identify potential long COVID among all patients with COVID-19, patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and patients who had COVID-19 but were not hospitalised. Feature importance was determined via Shapley values. We further validated the models on data from a fourth site.
FINDINGS: Our models identified, with high accuracy, patients who potentially have long COVID, achieving areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0·92 (all patients), 0·90 (hospitalised), and 0·85 (non-hospitalised). Important features, as defined by Shapley values, include rate of health-care utilisation, patient age, dyspnoea, and other diagnosis and medication information available within the electronic health record.
INTERPRETATION: Patients identified by our models as potentially having long COVID can be interpreted as patients warranting care at a specialty clinic for long COVID, which is an essential proxy for long COVID diagnosis as its definition continues to evolve. We also achieve the urgent goal of identifying potential long COVID in patients for clinical trials. As more data sources are identified, our models can be retrained and tuned based on the needs of individual studies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is not known whether sotrovimab, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment authorized for early symptomatic COVID-19 patients, is also effective in preventing the progression of severe disease and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant infection.
METHODS: Observational cohort study of non-hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from October 1st 2021 - December 11th 2021, using electronic health records from a statewide health system plus state-level vaccine and mortality data. We used propensity matching to select 3 patients not receiving mAbs for each patient who received outpatient sotrovimab treatment. The primary outcome was 28-day hospitalization; secondary outcomes included mortality and severity of hospitalization.
RESULTS: Of 10,036 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 522 receiving sotrovimab were matched to 1,563 not receiving mAbs. Compared to mAb-untreated patients, sotrovimab treatment was associated with a 63% decrease in the odds of all-cause hospitalization (raw rate 2.1% versus 5.7%; adjusted OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.66) and an 89% decrease in the odds of all-cause 28-day mortality (raw rate 0% versus 1.0%; adjusted OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.0-0.79), and may reduce respiratory disease severity among those hospitalized.

	abstract = {We aimed to identify characteristics associated with postdischarge health resource use in children without medical complexity who survived an episode of prolonged mechanical ventilation for respiratory illness. We hypothesized that longer durations of mechanical ventilation, noncomplex chronic conditions, and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) would be associated with readmission or an Emergency Department (ED) visit. In this retrospective cohort, we evaluated children without a complex chronic condition who survived a respiratory illness requiring ≥3 days of mechanical ventilation and who had insurance eligibility within the Colorado All Payers Claims Database. We used insurance claims to characterize health resource use and multivariable logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with readmission or an ED visit during the postdischarge year. We evaluated 82 children, median age 12.8 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 4.0-24.1), 20 (24%) with a noncomplex chronic condition and 62 (76%) without any chronic conditions. Bronchiolitis (60%) and pneumonia/aspiration pneumonitis (17%) were the most common etiologies of respiratory failure and 47 (57%) patients had severe ARDS. Forty-six (56%) patients had an ED visit or readmission. Among the 18 readmitted patients, 16/18 (89%) readmissions were for respiratory illness. Forty (49%) patients had ≥2 outpatient pulmonary visits and 45 (55%) filled a pulmonary medication prescription. In analyses controlling for age, illness severity and mechanical ventilation duration, severe ARDS was predictive of ED visit or readmission (odds ratio [OR]: 5.53 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.79, 19.09]). Children who survive prolonged mechanical ventilation for respiratory disease experience high rates of postdischarge health resource use, particularly those surviving severe ARDS.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to harmonize data from electronic health records (EHRs) into common units, and impute units that were missing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) table of laboratory measurement data-over 3.1 billion patient records and over 19 000 unique measurement concepts in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common-data-model format from 55 data partners. We grouped ontologically similar OMOP concepts together for 52 variables relevant to COVID-19 research, and developed a unit-harmonization pipeline comprised of (1) selecting a canonical unit for each measurement variable, (2) arriving at a formula for conversion, (3) obtaining clinical review of each formula, (4) applying the formula to convert data values in each unit into the target canonical unit, and (5) removing any harmonized value that fell outside of accepted value ranges for the variable. For data with missing units for all the results within a lab test for a data partner, we compared values with pooled values of all data partners, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
RESULTS: Of the concepts without missing values, we harmonized 88.1% of the values, and imputed units for 78.2% of records where units were absent (41% of contributors' records lacked units).
DISCUSSION: The harmonization and inference methods developed herein can serve as a resource for initiatives aiming to extract insight from heterogeneous EHR collections. Unique properties of centralized data are harnessed to enable unit inference.
CONCLUSION: The pipeline we developed for the pooled N3C data enables use of measurements that would otherwise be unavailable for analysis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify postdischarge outcome phenotypes and risk factors for poor outcomes using insurance claims data.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Single quaternary center.
PATIENTS: Children without preexisting tracheostomy who required greater than or equal to 3 days of invasive mechanical ventilation, survived the hospitalization, and had postdischarge insurance eligibility in Colorado's All Payer Claims Database.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We used unsupervised machine learning to identify functional outcome phenotypes based on claims data representative of postdischarge morbidities. We assessed health trajectory by comparing change in the number of insurance claims between quarters 1 and 4 of the postdischarge year. Regression analyses identified variables associated with unfavorable outcomes. The 381 subjects had median age 3.3 years (interquartile range, 0.9-12 yr), and 147 (39%) had a complex chronic condition. Primary diagnoses were respiratory (41%), injury (23%), and neurologic (11%). We identified three phenotypes: lower morbidity (n = 300), higher morbidity (n = 62), and 1-year nonsurvivors (n = 19). Complex chronic conditions most strongly predicted the nonsurvivor phenotype. Longer PICU stays and tracheostomy placement most strongly predicted the higher morbidity phenotype. Patients with high but improving postdischarge resource use were differentiated by high illness severity and long PICU stays. Patients with persistently high or increasing resource use were differentiated by complex chronic conditions and tracheostomy placement.
CONCLUSIONS: New morbidities are common after prolonged mechanical ventilation. Identifying phenotypes at high risk of postdischarge morbidity may facilitate prognostic enrichment in clinical trials.},

@article{NSP_podium2022,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine the incidence, prognostic performance, and generalizability of the Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) organ dysfunction criteria using electronic health record (EHR) data. Additionally, we sought to compare the performance of the PODIUM criteria with the organ dysfunction criteria proposed by the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC).
METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study of critically ill children at 2 medical centers in the United States between 2010 and 2018. We assessed prevalence of organ dysfunction based on the PODIUM and IPSCC criteria for each 24-hour period from admission to 28 days. We studied the prognostic performance of the criteria to discriminate in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: Overall, 22 427 PICU admissions met inclusion criteria, and in-hospital mortality was 2.3%. The cumulative incidence of each PODIUM organ dysfunction ranged from 15% to 30%, with an in-hospital mortality of 6% to 10% for most organ systems. The number of concurrent PODIUM organ dysfunctions demonstrated good-to-excellent discrimination for in-hospital mortality (area under the curve 0.87-0.93 for day 1 through 28) and compared favorably to the IPSCC criteria (area under the curve 0.84-0.92, P < .001 to P = .06).
CONCLUSIONS: We present the first evaluation of the PODIUM organ dysfunction criteria in 2 EHR databases. The use of the PODIUM organ dysfunction criteria appears promising for epidemiologic and clinical research studies using EHR data. More studies are needed to evaluate the PODIUM criteria that are not routinely collected in structured format in EHR databases.},

@article{Martin2022,
	abstract = {Importance: Understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in US children has been limited by the lack of large, multicenter studies with granular data.
Objective: To examine the characteristics, changes over time, outcomes, and severity risk factors of children with SARS-CoV-2 within the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C).
Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort study of encounters with end dates before September 24, 2021, was conducted at 56 N3C facilities throughout the US. Participants included children younger than 19 years at initial SARS-CoV-2 testing.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Case incidence and severity over time, demographic and comorbidity severity risk factors, vital sign and laboratory trajectories, clinical outcomes, and acute COVID-19 vs multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and Delta vs pre-Delta variant differences for children with SARS-CoV-2.
Results: A total of 1 068 410 children were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 167 262 test results (15.6%) were positive (82 882 [49.6%] girls; median age, 11.9 [IQR, 6.0-16.1] years). Among the 10 245 children (6.1%) who were hospitalized, 1423 (13.9%) met the criteria for severe disease: mechanical ventilation (796 [7.8%]), vasopressor-inotropic support (868 [8.5%]), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (42 [0.4%]), or death (131 [1.3%]). Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.21-1.56), Black/African American race (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.06-1.47), obesity (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01-1.41), and several pediatric complex chronic condition (PCCC) subcategories were associated with higher severity disease. Vital signs and many laboratory test values from the day of admission were predictive of peak disease severity. Variables associated with increased odds for MIS-C vs acute COVID-19 included male sex (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.33-1.90), Black/African American race (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.17-1.77), younger than 12 years (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.51-2.18), obesity (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.40-2.22), and not having a pediatric complex chronic condition (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.80). The children with MIS-C had a more inflammatory laboratory profile and severe clinical phenotype, with higher rates of invasive ventilation (117 of 707 [16.5%] vs 514 of 8241 [6.2%]; P < .001) and need for vasoactive-inotropic support (191 of 707 [27.0%] vs 426 of 8241 [5.2%]; P < .001) compared with those who had acute COVID-19. Comparing children during the Delta vs pre-Delta eras, there was no significant change in hospitalization rate (1738 [6.0%] vs 8507 [6.2%]; P = .18) and lower odds for severe disease (179 [10.3%] vs 1242 [14.6%]) (decreased by a factor of 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.79; P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of US children with SARS-CoV-2, there were observed differences in demographic characteristics, preexisting comorbidities, and initial vital sign and laboratory values between severity subgroups. Taken together, these results suggest that early identification of children likely to progress to severe disease could be achieved using readily available data elements from the day of admission. Further work is needed to translate this knowledge into improved outcomes.},

	abstract = {Importance: Hyperosmolar agents are cornerstone therapies for pediatric severe traumatic brain injury. Guideline recommendations for 3% hypertonic saline (HTS) are based on limited numbers of patients, and no study to date has supported a recommendation for mannitol.
Objectives: To characterize current use of hyperosmolar agents in pediatric severe traumatic brain injury and assess whether HTS or mannitol is associated with greater decreases in intracranial pressure (ICP) and/or increases in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).
Design, Setting, and Participants: In this comparative effectiveness research study, 1018 children were screened and 18 were excluded; 787 children received some form of hyperosmolar therapy during the ICP-directed phase of care, with 521 receiving a bolus. Three of these children were excluded because they had received only bolus administration of both HTS and mannitol in the same hour, leaving 518 children (at 44 clinical sites in 8 countries) for analysis. The study was conducted from February 1, 2014, to September 31, 2017, with follow-up for 1 week after injury. Final analysis was performed July 20, 2021.
Interventions: Boluses of HTS and mannitol were administered.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Data on ICP and CPP were collected before and after medication administration. Statistical methods included linear mixed models and corrections for potential confounding variables to compare the 2 treatments.
Results: A total of 518 children (mean [SD] age, 7.6 [5.4] years; 336 [64.9%] male; 274 [52.9%] White) were included. Participants' mean (SD) Glasgow Coma Scale score was 5.2 (1.8). Bolus HTS was observed to decrease ICP and increase CPP (mean [SD] ICP, 1.03 [6.77] mm Hg; P < .001; mean [SD] CPP, 1.25 [12.47] mm Hg; P < .001), whereas mannitol was observed to increase CPP (mean [SD] CPP, 1.20 [11.43] mm Hg; P = .009). In the primary outcome, HTS was associated with a greater reduction in ICP compared with mannitol (unadjusted β, -0.85; 95% CI, -1.53 to -0.19), but no association was seen after adjustments (adjusted β, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.32 to 0.25; P = .18). No differences in CPP were observed. When ICP was greater than 20 mm Hg, greater than 25 mm Hg, or greater than 30 mm Hg, HTS outperformed mannitol for each threshold in observed ICP reduction (>20 mm Hg: unadjusted β, -2.51; 95% CI, -3.86 to -1.15, P < .001; >25 mm Hg: unadjusted β, -3.88; 95% CI, -5.69 to -2.06, P < .001; >30 mm Hg: unadjusted β, -4.07; 95% CI, -6.35 to -1.79, P < .001), with results remaining significant for ICP greater than 25 mm Hg in adjusted analysis.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness research study, bolus HTS was associated with lower ICP and higher CPP, whereas mannitol was associated only with higher CPP. After adjustment for confounders, both therapies showed no association with ICP and CPP. During ICP crises, HTS was associated with better performance than mannitol.},

@article{Xing2021,
	abstract = {Cell or nucleus detection is a fundamental task in microscopy image analysis and has recently achieved state-of-the-art performance by using deep neural networks. However, training supervised deep models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) usually requires sufficient annotated image data, which is prohibitively expensive or unavailable in some applications. Additionally, when applying a CNN to new datasets, it is common to annotate individual cells/nuclei in those target datasets for model re-learning, leading to inefficient and low-throughput image analysis. To tackle these problems, we present a bidirectional, adversarial domain adaptation method for nucleus detection on cross-modality microscopy image data. Specifically, the method learns a deep regression model for individual nucleus detection with both source-to-target and target-to-source image translation. In addition, we explicitly extend this unsupervised domain adaptation method to a semi-supervised learning situation and further boost the nucleus detection performance. We evaluate the proposed method on three cross-modality microscopy image datasets, which cover a wide variety of microscopy imaging protocols or modalities, and obtain a significant improvement in nucleus detection compared to reference baseline approaches. In addition, our semi-supervised method is very competitive with recent fully supervised learning models trained with all real target training labels.},

	abstract = {COVID19 is a heterogeneous medical condition involving diverse underlying pathophysiological processes including hyperinflammation, endothelial damage, thrombotic microangiopathy, and end-organ damage. Limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms driving these processes and lack of staging biomarkers hamper the ability to stratify patients for targeted therapeutics. We report here the results of a cross-sectional multi-omics analysis of hospitalized COVID19 patients revealing that seroconversion status associates with distinct underlying pathophysiological states. Low antibody titers associate with hyperactive T cells and NK cells, high levels of IFN alpha, gamma and lambda ligands, markers of systemic complement activation, and depletion of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets. Upon seroconversion, all of these processes are attenuated, observing instead increases in B cell subsets, emergency hematopoiesis, increased D-dimer, and hypoalbuminemia. We propose that seroconversion status could potentially be used as a biosignature to stratify patients for therapeutic intervention and to inform analysis of clinical trial results in heterogenous patient populations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations of demographic, clinical, laboratory, organ dysfunction, and illness severity variable values with: 1) sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock in children with infection and 2) multiple organ dysfunction or death in children with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020.
STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms "sepsis," "septicemia," or "septic shock" in the title or abstract.
DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed.
DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Strong associations of several markers of organ dysfunction with the outcomes of interest among infected and septic children support their inclusion in the data validation phase of the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Previous criteria for coagulation dysfunction in critically ill children were based mainly on expert opinion.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate current evidence regarding coagulation tests associated with adverse outcomes in children to inform criteria for coagulation dysfunction during critical illness.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches of PubMed and Embase were conducted from January 1992 to January 2020 by using a combination of medical subject heading terms and text words to define concepts of coagulation dysfunction, pediatric critical illness, and outcomes of interest.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if critically ill children with coagulation dysfunction were evaluated, if performance characteristics of assessment and/or scoring tools to screen for coagulation dysfunction were evaluated, and if outcomes related to mortality or functional status, organ-specific outcomes, or other patient-centered outcomes were assessed.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted from each eligible study into a standard data extraction form, along with risk of bias assessment, by a task force member.
RESULTS: The systematic review supports the presence of at least 2 of the following criteria reflecting coagulation dysfunction in the absence of liver dysfunction: platelet count <100 000 cells per μL, international normalized ratio >1.5, fibrinogen level <150 mg/dL, and D-dimer value above 10 times the upper limit of normal, or above the assay's upper limit of detection if this limit is below 10 times the upper limit of normal.
LIMITATIONS: The proposed criteria for coagulation dysfunction are limited by the available evidence and will require future validation.
CONCLUSIONS: Validation of the proposed criteria and identified scientific priorities will enhance our understanding of coagulation dysfunction in critically ill children.},

However, the epidemiology, mechanisms, time course, and outcomes among children with multiple organ dysfunction vary substantially. We posit that the term pediatric multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (or MODS) should be reserved for patients with a systemic pathologic state resulting from a common mechanism (or mechanisms) that affects numerous organ systems simultaneously. In contrast, children in whom organ injuries are attributable to distinct mechanisms should be considered to have additive organ system dysfunctions but not the syndrome of MODS. Although such differentiation may not always be possible with current scientific knowledge, we make the case for how attempts to differentiate multiple organ dysfunction from other states of additive organ dysfunctions can help to evolve clinical and research priorities in diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy from largely organ-specific to more holistic strategies.},

OBJECTIVE: To develop consensus criteria for endocrine dysfunction in critically ill children by assessing the association of various biomarkers with clinical and functional outcomes.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase were searched from January 1992 to January 2020.

STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they evaluated assessment/scoring tools to screen for hematologic dysfunction and assessed outcomes of mortality, functional status, organ-specific outcomes, or other patient-centered outcomes. Studies of adults or premature infants, animal studies, reviews/commentaries, small case series, and non-English language studies with inability to determine eligibility were excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted from each eligible study into a standard data extraction form along with risk of bias assessment.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were included. The systematic review supports the following criteria for hematologic dysfunction: thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100000 cells/µL in patients without hematologic or oncologic diagnosis, platelet count <30000 cells/µL in patients with hematologic or oncologic diagnoses, or platelet count decreased ≥50% from baseline; or leukocyte count <3000 cells/µL; or hemoglobin concentration between 5 and 7 g/dL (nonsevere) or <5 g/dL (severe).
LIMITATIONS: Most studies evaluated pre-specified thresholds of cytopenias. No studies addressed associations between the etiology or progression of cytopenias overtime with outcomes, and no studies evaluated cellular function.

RESULTS: We provided binary (no or yes) and graded (no, nonsevere, or severe) definitions of respiratory dysfunction, prioritizing oxygenation and respiratory support. The proposed criteria were approved by 82% of members in the first round, with a score of 8 of 9 (interquartile range 7-8).
LIMITATIONS: Exclusion of non-English publications, heterogeneity across the pediatric age range, small sample sizes, and incomplete handling of confounders are limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose definitions for respiratory dysfunction in critically ill children after an exhaustive literature review.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Prior criteria to define pediatric multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) did not include gastrointestinal dysfunction.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to evaluate current evidence and to develop consensus criteria for gastrointestinal dysfunction in critically ill children.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches of PubMed and EMBASE were conducted from January 1992 to January 2020, using medical subject heading terms and text words to define gastrointestinal dysfunction, pediatric critical illness, and outcomes.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they evaluated critically ill children with gastrointestinal dysfunction, performance characteristics of assessment/scoring tools to screen for gastrointestinal dysfunction, and assessed outcomes related to mortality, functional status, organ-specific outcomes, or other patient-centered outcomes. Studies of adults or premature infants, animal studies, reviews/commentaries, case series with sample size ≤10, and non-English language studies with inability to determine eligibility criteria were excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted from each eligible study into a standard data extraction form along with risk of bias assessment by a task force member.
RESULTS: The systematic review supports the following criteria for severe gastrointestinal dysfunction: 1a) bowel perforation, 1b) pneumatosis intestinalis, or 1c) bowel ischemia, present on plain abdominal radiograph, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or gross surgical inspection, or 2) rectal sloughing of gut mucosa.
LIMITATIONS: The validity of the consensus criteria for gastrointestinal dysfunction are limited by the quantity and quality of current evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the role of gastrointestinal dysfunction in the pathophysiology and outcomes of MODS is important in pediatric critical illness.},

OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) scoring systems to estimate severity of illness and to characterize the performance characteristics of currently used scoring tools and clinical assessments for organ dysfunction in critically ill children.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches of PubMed and Embase were conducted from January 1992 to January 2020.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they evaluated critically ill children with MOD, evaluated the performance characteristics of scoring tools for MOD, and assessed outcomes related to mortality, functional status, organ-specific outcomes, or other patient-centered outcomes.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted into a standard data extraction form by a task force member.
RESULTS: Of 1152 unique abstracts screened, 156 full text studies were assessed including a total of 54 eligible studies. The most commonly reported scores were the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (PELOD), pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (pSOFA), Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM), PRISM, and counts of organ dysfunction using the International Pediatric Sepsis Definition Consensus Conference. Cut-offs for specific organ dysfunction criteria, diagnostic elements included, and use of counts versus weighting varied substantially.
LIMITATIONS: While scores demonstrated an increase in mortality associated with the severity and number of organ dysfunctions, the performance ranged widely.

DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted from each eligible study into a data extraction form along with risk of bias assessment by a task force member.
RESULTS: The systematic review supports criteria for acute liver dysfunction, in the absence of known chronic liver disease, as having onset of symptoms <8 weeks, combined with biochemical evidence of acute liver injury, and liver-based coagulopathy, with hepatic encephalopathy required for an international normalized ratio between 1.5 and 2.0.
LIMITATIONS: Unable to assess acute-on-chronic liver dysfunction, subjective nature of hepatic encephalopathy, relevant articles missed by reviewers.
CONCLUSIONS: Proposed criteria identify an infant, child, or adolescent who has reached a clinical threshold where any of the 3 outcomes (alive with native liver, death, or liver transplant) are possible and should prompt an urgent liaison with a recognized pediatric liver transplant center if liver failure is the principal driver of multiple organ dysfunction.},

@article{Deer2021,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous publications describe the clinical manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC or "long COVID"), but they are difficult to integrate because of heterogeneous methods and the lack of a standard for denoting the many phenotypic manifestations. Patient-led studies are of particular importance for understanding the natural history of COVID-19, but integration is hampered because they often use different terms to describe the same symptom or condition. This significant disparity in patient versus clinical characterization motivated the proposed ontological approach to specifying manifestations, which will improve capture and integration of future long COVID studies.
METHODS: The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a widely used standard for exchange and analysis of phenotypic abnormalities in human disease but has not yet been applied to the analysis of COVID-19.
FUNDING: We identified 303 articles published before April 29, 2021, curated 59 relevant manuscripts that described clinical manifestations in 81 cohorts three weeks or more following acute COVID-19, and mapped 287 unique clinical findings to HPO terms. We present layperson synonyms and definitions that can be used to link patient self-report questionnaires to standard medical terminology. Long COVID clinical manifestations are not assessed consistently across studies, and most manifestations have been reported with a wide range of synonyms by different authors. Across at least 10 cohorts, authors reported 31 unique clinical features corresponding to HPO terms; the most commonly reported feature was Fatigue (median 45.1%) and the least commonly reported was Nausea (median 3.9%), but the reported percentages varied widely between studies.
INTERPRETATION: Translating long COVID manifestations into computable HPO terms will improve analysis, data capture, and classification of long COVID patients. If researchers, clinicians, and patients share a common language, then studies can be compared/pooled more effectively. Furthermore, mapping lay terminology to HPO will help patients assist clinicians and researchers in creating phenotypic characterizations that are computationally accessible, thereby improving the stratification, diagnosis, and treatment of long COVID.

We convened the Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) expert panel to summarize data characterizing single and multiple organ dysfunction and to derive contemporary criteria for pediatric organ dysfunction. The panel was composed of 88 members representing 47 institutions and 7 countries. We conducted systematic reviews of the literature to derive evidence-based criteria for single organ dysfunction for neurologic, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, acute liver, renal, hematologic, coagulation, endocrine, endothelial, and immune system dysfunction. We searched PubMed and Embase from January 1992 to January 2020. Study identification was accomplished using a combination of medical subject headings terms and keywords related to concepts of pediatric organ dysfunction. Electronic searches were performed by medical librarians. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the authors reported original data collected in critically ill children; evaluated performance characteristics of scoring tools or clinical assessments for organ dysfunction; and assessed a patient-centered, clinically meaningful outcome. Data were abstracted from each included study into an electronic data extraction form. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Consensus was achieved for a final set of 43 criteria for pediatric organ dysfunction through iterative voting and discussion. Although the PODIUM criteria for organ dysfunction were limited by available evidence and will require validation, they provide a contemporary foundation for researchers to identify and study single and multiple organ dysfunction in critically ill children.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: For children hospitalized with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI), to use postdischarge insurance claims to identify: (1) healthcare utilization patterns representative of functional outcome phenotypes and (2) patient and hospitalization characteristics that predict outcome phenotype.
SETTING: Two pediatric trauma centers and a state-level insurance claim aggregator.
PATIENTS: A total of 289 children, who survived a hospitalization after TBI between 2009 and 2014, were in the hospital trauma registry, and had postdischarge insurance eligibility.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
MAIN MEASURES: Unsupervised machine learning to identify phenotypes based on postdischarge insurance claims. Regression analyses to identify predictors of phenotype.
RESULTS: Median age 5 years (interquartile range 2-12), 29% (84/289) female. TBI severity: 30% severe, 14% moderate, and 60% mild. We identified 4 functional outcome phenotypes. Phenotypes 3 and 4 were the highest utilizers of resources. Morbidity burden was highest during the first 4 postdischarge months and subsequently decreased in all domains except respiratory. Severity and mechanism of injury, intracranial pressure monitor placement, seizures, and hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay were phenotype predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: Unsupervised machine learning identified postdischarge phenotypes at high risk for morbidities. Most phenotype predictors are available early in the hospitalization and can be used for prognostic enrichment of clinical trials targeting mitigation or treatment of domain-specific morbidities.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed observational data from SARS-CoV-2-positive adults in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a multicenter, longitudinal U.S. cohort (January 2018-February 2021), with a prescription for GLP1-RA, SGLT2i, or DPP4i within 24 months of positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The primary outcome was 60-day mortality, measured from positive SARS-CoV-2 test date. Secondary outcomes were total mortality during the observation period and emergency room visits, hospitalization, and mechanical ventilation within 14 days. Associations were quantified with odds ratios (ORs) estimated with targeted maximum likelihood estimation using a super learner approach, accounting for baseline characteristics.
RESULTS: The study included 12,446 individuals (53.4% female, 62.5% White, mean $\pm$ SD age 58.6 $\pm$ 13.1 years). The 60-day mortality was 3.11% (387 of 12,446), with 2.06% (138 of 6,692) for GLP1-RA use, 2.32% (85 of 3,665) for SGLT2i use, and 5.67% (199 of 3,511) for DPP4i use. Both GLP1-RA and SGLT2i use were associated with lower 60-day mortality compared with DPP4i use (OR 0.54 [95% CI 0.37-0.80] and 0.66 [0.50-0.86], respectively). Use of both medications was also associated with decreased total mortality, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations.
CONCLUSIONS: Among SARS-CoV-2-positive adults, premorbid GLP1-RA and SGLT2i use, compared with DPP4i use, was associated with lower odds of mortality and other adverse outcomes, although DPP4i users were older and generally sicker.},

Design, Setting, and Participants: In a retrospective cohort study of 1 926 526 US adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection (polymerase chain reaction >99% or antigen <1%) and adult patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection who served as controls from 34 medical centers nationwide between January 1, 2020, and December 7, 2020, patients were stratified using a World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and demographic characteristics. Differences between groups over time were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Random forest and XGBoost models were used to predict severe clinical course (death, discharge to hospice, invasive ventilatory support, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).
Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient demographic characteristics and COVID-19 severity using the World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and differences between groups over time using multivariable logistic regression.
Results: The cohort included 174 568 adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 44.4 [18.6] years; 53.2% female) and 1 133 848 adult controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [19.2] years; 57.1% female). Of the 174 568 adults with SARS-CoV-2, 32 472 (18.6%) were hospitalized, and 6565 (20.2%) of those had a severe clinical course (invasive ventilatory support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, death, or discharge to hospice). Of the hospitalized patients, mortality was 11.6% overall and decreased from 16.4% in March to April 2020 to 8.6% in September to October 2020 (P = .002 for monthly trend). Using 64 inputs available on the first hospital day, this study predicted a severe clinical course using random forest and XGBoost models (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.87 for both) that were stable over time. The factor most strongly associated with clinical severity was pH; this result was consistent across machine learning methods. In a separate multivariable logistic regression model built for inference, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per year; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04), male sex (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.51-1.69), liver disease (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08-1.34), dementia (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.13-1.41), African American (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.20) and Asian (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.12-1.57) race, and obesity (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.27-1.46) were independently associated with higher clinical severity.
Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that COVID-19 mortality decreased over time during 2020 and that patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities were associated with higher clinical severity. The machine learning models accurately predicted ultimate clinical severity using commonly collected clinical data from the first 24 hours of a hospital admission.},

@article{Chauhan2021,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV2 pandemic has caused high inpatient mortality and morbidity throughout the world. COVID19 convalescent plasma has been utilized as a potential therapy for patients hospitalized with COVID19 pneumonia. This study evaluated the outcomes of hospitalized COVID19 patients treated with COVID19 convalescent plasma in a prospective, observational multicenter trial.
METHODS: From April 2020 through August 2020, hospitalized COVID19 patients at 16 participating hospitals in Colorado were enrolled and treated with COVID19 convalescent plasma (CCP) and compared to hospitalized patients with COVID19 who were not treated with convalescent plasma. Plasma antibody levels were determined following the trial given that antibody tests were not approved at the initiation of the trial. CCP-treated and untreated COVID19 hospitalized patients were matched using propensity scores followed by analysis for length of hospitalization and inpatient mortality.
RESULTS: 542 total hospitalized COVID19 patients were enrolled at 16 hospitals across the region. A total of 468 hospitalized COVID19 patients were entered into propensity score matching with 188 patients matched for analysis in the CCP-treatment and control arms. Fine-Gray models revealed increased length of hospital stay in CCP-treated patients and no change in inpatient mortality compared to controls. In subgroup analysis of CCP-treated patients within 7 days of admission, there was no difference in length of hospitalization and inpatient mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: These data show that treatment of hospitalized COVID19 patients with CCP did not significantly improve patient hospitalization length of stay or inpatient mortality.},

To expedite integrated and collaborative COVID-19 research, we completed multi-omics analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including matched analysis of the whole-blood transcriptome, plasma proteomics with two complementary platforms, cytokine profiling, plasma and red blood cell metabolomics, deep immune cell phenotyping by mass cytometry, and clinical data annotation. We refer to this multidimensional dataset as the COVIDome. We then created the COVIDome Explorer, an online researcher portal where the data can be analyzed and visualized in real time. We illustrate herein the use of the COVIDome dataset through a multi-omics analysis of biosignatures associated with C-reactive protein (CRP), an established marker of poor prognosis in COVID-19, revealing associations between CRP levels and damage-associated molecular patterns, depletion of protective serpins, and mitochondrial metabolism dysregulation.

@article{Mehta2021,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Relatively little is known about the use patterns of potential pharmacologic treatments of COVID-19 in the United States.
OBJECTIVE: To use the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a large, multicenter, longitudinal cohort, to characterize the use of hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and dexamethasone, overall as well as across individuals, health systems, and time.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: 43 health systems in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: 137 870 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 between 1 February 2020 and 28 February 2021.
MEASUREMENTS: Inpatient use of hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, or dexamethasone.
RESULTS: Among 137 870 persons hospitalized with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, 8754 (6.3%) received hydroxychloroquine, 29 272 (21.2%) remdesivir, and 53 909 (39.1%) dexamethasone during the study period. Since the release of results from the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) trial in mid-June, approximately 78% to 84% of people who have had invasive mechanical ventilation have received dexamethasone or other glucocorticoids. The use of hydroxychloroquine increased during March 2020, peaking at 42%, and started declining by April 2020. By contrast, remdesivir and dexamethasone use gradually increased over the study period. Dexamethasone and remdesivir use varied substantially across health centers (intraclass correlation coefficient, 14.2% for dexamethasone and 84.6% for remdesivir).
LIMITATION: Because most N3C data contributors are academic medical centers, findings may not reflect the experience of community hospitals.
CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone, an evidence-based treatment of COVID-19, may be underused among persons who are mechanically ventilated. The use of remdesivir and dexamethasone varied across health systems, suggesting variation in patient case mix, drug access, treatment protocols, and quality of care.

@article{Sottile2021,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To rapidly develop, validate, and implement a novel real-time mortality score for the COVID-19 pandemic that improves upon SOFA for decision support for a Crisis Standards of Care team.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed, verified, and deployed a stacked generalization model to predict mortality using data available in the EHR by combining five previously validated scores and additional novel variables reported to be associated with COVID-19-specific mortality. We verified the model with prospectively collected data from 12 hospitals in Colorado between March 2020 and July 2020. We compared the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for the new model to the SOFA score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index.
RESULTS: The prospective cohort included 27,296 encounters, of which 1,358 (5.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 4,494 (16.5%) required intensive care unit care, 1,480 (5.4%) required mechanical ventilation, and 717 (2.6%) ended in death. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted mortality with AUROC 0.94. In the subset of patients with COVID-19, the stacked model predicted mortality with AUROC 0.90, whereas SOFA had AUROC of 0.85.
DISCUSSION: Stacked regression allows a flexible, updatable, live-implementable, ethically defensible predictive analytics tool for decision support that begins with validated models and includes only novel information that improves prediction.
CONCLUSION: We developed and validated an accurate in-hospital mortality prediction score in a live EHR for automatic and continuous calculation using a novel model that improved upon SOFA.},

Limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms driving these processes and lack of staging biomarkers hamper the ability to stratify patients for targeted therapeutics. We report here the results of a cross-sectional multi-omics analysis of hospitalized COVID19 patients revealing that seroconversion status associates with distinct underlying pathophysiological states. Seronegative COVID19 patients harbor hyperactive T cells and NK cells, high levels of IFN alpha, gamma and lambda ligands, markers of systemic complement activation, neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. In seropositive patients, all of these processes are attenuated, observing instead increases in B cell subsets, emergency hematopoiesis, increased markers of platelet activation, and hypoalbuminemia. We propose that seroconversion status could potentially be used as a biosignature to stratify patients for therapeutic intervention and to inform analysis of clinical trial results in heterogenous patient populations.},

@article{Stroh2021,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical mitigation of intracranial hypertension due to traumatic brain injury requires timely knowledge of intracranial pressure to avoid secondary injury or death. Noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) estimation that operates sufficiently fast at multihour timescales and requires only common patient measurements is a desirable tool for clinical decision support and improving traumatic brain injury patient outcomes. However, existing model-based nICP estimation methods may be too slow or require data that are not easily obtained.
OBJECTIVE: This work considers short- and real-time nICP estimation at multihour timescales based on arterial blood pressure (ABP) to better inform the ongoing development of practical models with commonly available data.
METHODS: We assess and analyze the effects of two distinct pathways of model development, either by increasing physiological integration using a simple pressure estimation model, or by increasing physiological fidelity using a more complex model. Comparison of the model approaches is performed using a set of quantitative model validation criteria over hour-scale times applied to model nICP estimates in relation to observed ICP.
RESULTS: The simple fully coupled estimation scheme based on windowed regression outperforms a more complex nICP model with prescribed intracranial inflow when pulsatile ABP inflow conditions are provided. We also show that the simple estimation data requirements can be reduced to 1-minute averaged ABP summary data under generic waveform representation.
CONCLUSIONS: Stronger performance of the simple bidirectional model indicates that feedback between the systemic vascular network and nICP estimation scheme is crucial for modeling over long intervals. However, simple model reduction to ABP-only dependence limits its utility in cases involving other brain injuries such as ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Additional methodologies and considerations needed to overcome these limitations are illustrated and discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical decision support (CDS) design best practices are intended to provide a narrative representation of factors that influence the success of CDS tools. However, they provide incomplete direction on evidence-based implementation principles.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe an integrated approach toward applying an existing implementation science (IS) framework with CDS design best practices to improve the effectiveness, sustainability, and reproducibility of CDS implementations.
METHODS: We selected the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) IS framework. We identified areas where PRISM and CDS design best practices complemented each other and defined methods to address each. Lessons learned from applying these methods were then used to further refine the integrated approach.
RESULTS: Our integrated approach to applying PRISM with CDS design best practices consists of 5 key phases that iteratively interact and inform each other: multilevel stakeholder engagement, designing the CDS, design and usability testing, thoughtful deployment, and performance evaluation and maintenance. The approach is led by a dedicated implementation team that includes clinical informatics and analyst builder expertise.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrating PRISM with CDS design best practices extends user-centered design and accounts for the multilevel, interacting, and dynamic factors that influence CDS implementation in health care. Integrating PRISM with CDS design best practices synthesizes the many known contextual factors that can influence the success of CDS tools, thereby enhancing the reproducibility and sustainability of CDS implementations. Others can adapt this approach to their situation to maximize and sustain CDS implementation success.},

@article{Trinkley2021,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited consideration of clinical decision support (CDS) design best practices, such as a user-centered design, is often cited as a key barrier to CDS adoption and effectiveness. The application of CDS best practices is resource intensive; thus, institutions often rely on commercially available CDS tools that are created to meet the generalized needs of many institutions and are not user centered. Beyond resource availability, insufficient guidance on how to address key aspects of implementation, such as contextual factors, may also limit the application of CDS best practices. An implementation science (IS) framework could provide needed guidance and increase the reproducibility of CDS implementations.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the effectiveness of an enhanced CDS tool informed by CDS best practices and an IS framework with a generic, commercially available CDS tool.
METHODS: We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed methods study. An IS-enhanced and commercial CDS alert were compared in a cluster randomized trial across 28 primary care clinics. Both alerts aimed to improve beta-blocker prescribing for heart failure. The enhanced alert was informed by CDS best practices and the Practical, Robust, Implementation, and Sustainability Model (PRISM) IS framework, whereas the commercial alert followed vendor-supplied specifications. Following PRISM, the enhanced alert was informed by iterative, multilevel stakeholder input and the dynamic interactions of the internal and external environment. Outcomes aligned with PRISM's evaluation measures, including patient reach, clinician adoption, and changes in prescribing behavior. Clinicians exposed to each alert were interviewed to identify design features that might influence adoption. The interviews were analyzed using a thematic approach.
RESULTS: Between March 15 and August 23, 2019, the enhanced alert fired for 61 patients (106 alerts, 87 clinicians) and the commercial alert fired for 26 patients (59 alerts, 31 clinicians). The adoption and effectiveness of the enhanced alert were significantly higher than those of the commercial alert (62% vs 29% alerts adopted, P<.001; 14% vs 0% changed prescribing, P=.006). Of the 21 clinicians interviewed, most stated that they preferred the enhanced alert.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that applying CDS best practices with an IS framework to create CDS tools improves implementation success compared with a commercially available tool.

@article{Zhang2020,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: We focus on the problem of scarcity of annotated training data for nucleus recognition in Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC)-stained pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) images. We hypothesize that deep learning-based domain adaptation is helpful for nucleus recognition when image annotations are unavailable in target data sets.
METHODS: We considered 2 different institutional pancreatic NET data sets: one (ie, source) containing 38 cases with 114 annotated images and the other (ie, target) containing 72 cases with 20 annotated images. The gold standards were manually annotated by 1 pathologist. We developed a novel deep learning-based domain adaptation framework to count different types of nuclei (ie, immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor, nontumor nuclei). We compared the proposed method with several recent fully supervised deep learning models, such as fully convolutional network-8s (FCN-8s), U-Net, fully convolutional regression network (FCRN) A, FCRNB, and fully residual convolutional network (FRCN). We also evaluated the proposed method by learning with a mixture of converted source images and real target annotations.
RESULTS: Our method achieved an F1 score of 81.3% and 62.3% for nucleus detection and classification in the target data set, respectively. Our method outperformed FCN-8s (53.6% and 43.6% for nucleus detection and classification, respectively), U-Net (61.1% and 47.6%), FCRNA (63.4% and 55.8%), and FCRNB (68.2% and 60.6%) in terms of F1 score and was competitive with FRCN (81.7% and 70.7%). In addition, learning with a mixture of converted source images and only a small set of real target labels could further boost the performance.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that deep learning-based domain adaptation is helpful for nucleus recognition in Ki-67 IHC stained images when target data annotations are not available. It would improve the applicability of deep learning models designed for downstream supervised learning tasks on different data sets.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Common data elements are a combination of a precisely defined question paired with a specified set of responses. Common data elements contribute to the National Institutes of Health-supported principle of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusableness of research data. Routine use of Common data elements and standardized definitions within pediatric critical care research are likely to promote collaboration, improve quality, and consistency of data collection, improve overall efficiency of study or trial setup, and facilitate cross-study comparisons, meta-analysis, and merging of study cohorts. The purpose of this Pediatric Critical Care Medicine Perspective is to establish a road map for the development of multinational, multidisciplinary consensus-based common data elements that could be adapted for use within any pediatric critical care subject area.
METHODS: We describe a multistep process for the creation of "core domains" of research (e.g. patient outcomes, health-related conditions, or aspects of health) and the development of common data elements within each core domain. We define a tiered approach to data collection based on relevance of each common data element to future studies and clinical practice within the field of interest. Additionally, we describe the use of the Delphi methods to achieve consensus of these common data element documents using an international, multidisciplinary panel of experts.},

@article{Haendel2021,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses societal challenges that require expeditious data and knowledge sharing. Though organizational clinical data are abundant, these are largely inaccessible to outside researchers. Statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. Here, we introduce the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science community focused on analyzing patient-level data from many centers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Clinical and Translational Science Award Program and scientific community created N3C to overcome technical, regulatory, policy, and governance barriers to sharing and harmonizing individual-level clinical data. We developed solutions to extract, aggregate, and harmonize data across organizations and data models, and created a secure data enclave to enable efficient, transparent, and reproducible collaborative analytics.
RESULTS: Organized in inclusive workstreams, we created legal agreements and governance for organizations and researchers; data extraction scripts to identify and ingest positive, negative, and possible COVID-19 cases; a data quality assurance and harmonization pipeline to create a single harmonized dataset; population of the secure data enclave with data, machine learning, and statistical analytics tools; dissemination mechanisms; and a synthetic data pilot to democratize data access.
CONCLUSIONS: The N3C has demonstrated that a multisite collaborative learning health network can overcome barriers to rapidly build a scalable infrastructure incorporating multiorganizational clinical data for COVID-19 analytics. We expect this effort to save lives by enabling rapid collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and data scientists to identify treatments and specialized care and thereby reduce the immediate and long-term impacts of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: For children hospitalized with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI), to use postdischarge insurance claims to identify: (1) healthcare utilization patterns representative of functional outcome phenotypes and (2) patient and hospitalization characteristics that predict outcome phenotype.
SETTING: Two pediatric trauma centers and a state-level insurance claim aggregator.
PATIENTS: A total of 289 children, who survived a hospitalization after TBI between 2009 and 2014, were in the hospital trauma registry, and had postdischarge insurance eligibility.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
MAIN MEASURES: Unsupervised machine learning to identify phenotypes based on postdischarge insurance claims. Regression analyses to identify predictors of phenotype.
RESULTS: Median age 5 years (interquartile range 2-12), 29% (84/289) female. TBI severity: 30% severe, 14% moderate, and 60% mild. We identified 4 functional outcome phenotypes. Phenotypes 3 and 4 were the highest utilizers of resources. Morbidity burden was highest during the first 4 postdischarge months and subsequently decreased in all domains except respiratory. Severity and mechanism of injury, intracranial pressure monitor placement, seizures, and hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay were phenotype predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: Unsupervised machine learning identified postdischarge phenotypes at high risk for morbidities. Most phenotype predictors are available early in the hospitalization and can be used for prognostic enrichment of clinical trials targeting mitigation or treatment of domain-specific morbidities.},

	abstract = {Cell or nucleus detection is a fundamental task in microscopy image analysis and has recently achieved state-of-the-art performance by using deep neural networks. However, training supervised deep models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) usually requires sufficient annotated image data, which is prohibitively expensive or unavailable in some applications. Additionally, when applying a CNN to new datasets, it is common to annotate individual cells/nuclei in those target datasets for model re-learning, leading to inefficient and low-throughput image analysis. To tackle these problems, we present a bidirectional, adversarial domain adaptation method for nucleus detection on cross-modality microscopy image data. Specifically, the method learns a deep regression model for individual nucleus detection with both source-to-target and target-to-source image translation. In addition, we explicitly extend this unsupervised domain adaptation method to a semi-supervised learning situation and further boost the nucleus detection performance. We evaluate the proposed method on three cross-modality microscopy image datasets, which cover a wide variety of microscopy imaging protocols or modalities, and obtain a significant improvement in nucleus detection compared to reference baseline approaches. In addition, our semi-supervised method is very competitive with recent fully supervised learning models trained with all real target training labels.},

@article{Ahmed2019,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because pediatric trauma-related mortality continues to decline, metrics assessing morbidity are needed to evaluate the impact of treatment after injury. Based on its value for assessing children with traumatic brain injuries and other critical illnesses, Functional Status Scale (FSS), a tool that measures function in six domains (communication, feeding, mental, motor, sensory, and respiratory), was evaluated as an outcome measure for the overall population of injured children.
METHODS: Children with at least one injury (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] severity ≥1) surviving to discharge between December 2011 and April 2013 were identified in a previous study of intensive care unit admissions. Morbidity was defined as additional morbidity in any domain (domain FSS change ≥2 or 'new domain morbidity') and additional overall morbidity (total FSS change ≥3) between preinjury status and discharge. Associations between injury profiles and the development of morbidity were analyzed.
RESULTS: We identified 553 injured children, with a mean of 2.0 $\pm$ 1.9 injuries. New domain and overall morbidity were observed in 17.0% and 11.0% of patients, respectively. New domain morbidity was associated with an increasing number of body regions with an injury with AIS ≥ 2 (p < 0.001), with severe (AIS ≥ 4) head (p = 0.04) and spine (p = 0.01) injuries and with at moderately severe (AIS ≥ 2) lower extremity injuries (p = 0.01). New domain morbidity was more common among patients with severe spine and lower extremity injuries (55.6% and 48.7%, respectively), with greatest impact in the motor domain (55.6% and 43.6%, respectively). New domain morbidity was associated with increasing injury severity score, number of moderately severe injuries and number of body regions with more than a moderately severe injury (p < 0.001 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher morbidity measured by the FSS is associated with increasing injury severity. These findings support the use of the FSS as a metric for assessing outcome after pediatric injury.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To 1) probabilistically link two important pediatric data sources, Virtual Pediatric Systems and PEDSnet, 2) evaluate linkage accuracy overall and in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, and 3) identify variables important to linkage accuracy.
DESIGN: Retrospective linkage of prospectively collected datasets from Virtual Pediatrics Systems, Inc (Los Angeles, CA) and the PEDSnet consortium.
SETTING: Single-center academic PICU.
PATIENTS: All PICU encounters between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017, that were deterministically matched between the two datasets.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We abstracted records from Virtual Pediatric Systems and PEDSnet corresponding to PICU encounters and probabilistically linked using 44 features shared by the two datasets. We generated a gold standard deterministic linkage using protected health information elements, which were then removed from datasets. We then calculated candidate pair log-likelihood ratios for all pairs of subjects and selected optimal pairs in a two-stage algorithm. A total of 22,051 gold standard PICU encounter pairs were identified over the study period. The optimal linkage model demonstrated excellent discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve > 0.99); 19,801 cases (89.9%) were matched with 13 false positives. The addition of two protected health information dates (admission month, birth day-of-year) increased to 20,189 (91.6%) the cases matched, with three false positives. Restricting to patients with Virtual Pediatric Systems diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock (n = 1,340 [6.1%]) matched 1,250 cases (93.2%) with zero false positives. Increased number of laboratory values present in the first 12 hours of admission significantly increased log-likelihood ratios, suggesting stronger candidate pair matching.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the use of probabilistic linkage to accurately join two complementary pediatric critical care datasets at a single academic PICU in the absence of protected health information. Combining datasets with curated diagnoses and granular measurements can validate patient acuity metrics and facilitate multicenter machine learning algorithms. We anticipate these methods will generalize to other common PICU diagnoses.},

@article{Xing2019,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Nucleus recognition is a critical yet challenging step in histopathology image analysis, for example, in Ki67 immunohistochemistry stained images. Although many automated methods have been proposed, most use a multi-stage processing pipeline to categorize nuclei, leading to cumbersome, low-throughput, and error-prone assessments. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep fully convolutional network for single-stage nucleus recognition.
METHODS: Instead of conducting direct pixel-wise classification, we formulate nucleus identification as a deep structured regression model. For each input image, it produces multiple proximity maps, each of which corresponds to one nucleus category and exhibits strong responses in central regions of the nuclei. In addition, by taking into consideration the nucleus distribution in histopathology images, we further introduce an auxiliary task, region of interest (ROI) extraction, to assist and boost the nucleus quantification with weak ROI annotation. The proposed network can be learned in an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel manner for simultaneous nucleus detection and classification.
RESULTS: We have evaluated this network on a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor Ki67 image dataset, and the experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches.
CONCLUSION: We present a new, pixel-to-pixel deep neural network with two sibling branches for effective nucleus recognition and observe that learning with another relevant task, ROI extraction, can further boost individual nucleus localization and classification.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our method provides a clean, single-stage nucleus recognition pipeline for histopathology image analysis, especially a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification, which would potentially benefit individual object quantification in whole-slide images.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to describe current outcomes of Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome present on day 1 of PICU admission.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study.
SETTING: Virtual Pediatric Systems, LLC, database admissions, January 2014 and December 2015.
PATIENTS: We analyzed 194,017 consecutive PICU admissions, (age 1 mo to 18 yr) from the 2014-2015 Virtual Pediatric Systems database.
INTERVENTIONS: We identified day 1 Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome by International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference criteria with day 1 laboratory and vital sign values. Functional status was evaluated by Pediatric Overall Performance Category and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scores from PICU admission and discharge.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Overall, PICU mortality was 2.1%. We identified day 1 Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome in 14.4% of admissions. Patients with Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome had higher mortality than those without Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (10.3% vs 0.7%; p < 0.0001), and a higher percentage of survivors had greater than or equal to 2 category worsening in Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score (3.6% vs 0.5%; p < 0.0001) or Pediatric Overall Performance Category score (6.0% vs 1.8%; p < 0.0001). The odds of death with day 1 Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome was 14.3 (95% CI, 13-15.7), while the odds of death or discharge with Pediatric Overall Performance Category/Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score greater than or equal to 3 (poor functional outcome) was 6.7 (95% CI, 6-7.4). In a subset of 148,188 patients from hospitals where limitation of support decisions were recorded, 5.8% patients with Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome had limitation of support decisions in place, compared with 0.8% of patients without Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (p < 0.0001). Of day 1 Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome patients who died, 43.1% had limitation of support decisions in place, and 41.6% had withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome present on day 1 of admission continues to be a major source of morbidity and mortality in the PICU, but risk of poor neurologic outcome may be improved. Further research is needed to understand decisions regarding limitation of support and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy decisions in patients admitted with day 1 Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Little is known about how parents of children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) participate or feel they should participate in decision making regarding placing an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor. The objective of this study was to identify the perspectives and decisional or information needs of parents whose child sustained a TBI and may require an ICP monitor.
METHODS: This was a qualitative study at one US level I pediatric trauma center. The authors conducted in-depth semistructured interviews with 1) parents of critically injured children who have sustained a TBI and 2) clinicians who regularly care for children with TBI.
RESULTS: The authors interviewed 10 parents of 7 children (60% were mothers and 80% were white) and 28 clinicians (17 ICU clinicians and 11 surgeons). Overall, the authors found concordance between and among parents and clinicians about parental involvement in ICP monitor decision making. Parents and clinicians agreed that decision making about ICP monitoring in children who have suffered TBI is not and should not be shared between the parents and clinicians. The concordance was represented in 3 emergent themes. Parents wanted transparency, communication, and information (theme 2), but the life-threatening context of this decision (theme 1) created an environment where all involved reflected a clear preference for paternalism (theme 3).
CONCLUSIONS: The clear and concordant preference for clinician paternalistic decision making coupled with the parents' needs to be informed suggests that a decision support tool for this decision should be clinician facing and should emphasize transparency in collaborative decision making between clinicians.},

@article{Ferrazzano2019,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is no consensus on the optimal timing and specific brain MRI sequences in the evaluation and management of severe pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI), and information on current practices is lacking. The authors performed a survey of MRI practices among sites participating in a multicenter study of severe pediatric TBI to provide information for designing future clinical trials using MRI to assess brain injury after severe pediatric TBI.
METHODS: Information on current imaging practices and resources was collected from 27 institutions participating in the Approaches and Decisions after Pediatric TBI Trial. Multiple-choice questions addressed the percentage of patients with TBI who have MRI studies, timing of MRI, MRI sequences used to investigate TBI, as well as the magnetic field strength of MR scanners used at the participating institutions and use of standardized MRI protocols for imaging after severe pediatric TBI.
RESULTS: Overall, the reported use of MRI in pediatric patients with severe TBI at participating sites was high, with 40% of sites indicating that they obtain MRI studies in > 95% of this patient population. Differences were observed in the frequency of MRI use between US and international sites, with the US sites obtaining MRI in a higher proportion of their pediatric patients with severe TBI (94% of US vs 44% of international sites reported MRI in at least 70% of patients with severe TBI). The reported timing and composition of MRI studies was highly variable across sites. Sixty percent of sites reported typically obtaining an MRI study within the first 7 days postinjury, with the remainder of responses distributed throughout the first 30-day postinjury period. Responses indicated that MRI sequences sensitive for diffuse axonal injury and ischemia are frequently obtained in patients with TBI, whereas perfusion imaging and spectroscopy techniques are less common.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this survey suggest that despite the lack of consensus or guidelines, MRI is commonly obtained during the acute clinical setting after severe pediatric TBI. The variation in MRI practices highlights the need for additional studies to determine the utility, optimal timing, and composition of clinical MRI studies after TBI. The information in this survey describes current clinical MRI practices in children with severe TBI and identifies important challenges and objectives that should be considered when designing future studies.},

Finally, we provide a freely available SMART on FHIR application that can be used within EHR systems. Our approach allows readily available laboratory tests in EHR to be reused for deep phenotyping and exploits the hierarchical structure of HPO to integrate distinct tests that have comparable medical interpretations for association studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Little is known about how clinicians make the complex decision regarding whether to place an intracranial pressure monitor in children with traumatic brain injury. The objective of this study was to identify the decisional needs of multidisciplinary clinician stakeholders.
DESIGN: Semi-structured qualitative interviews with clinicians who regularly care for children with traumatic brain injury.
SETTING: One U.S. level I pediatric trauma center.
SUBJECTS: Twenty-eight clinicians including 17 ICU nurses, advanced practice providers, and physicians and 11 pediatric surgeons and neurosurgeons interviewed between August 2017 and February 2018.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 43 years (range, 30-66 yr), mean experience of 10 years (range, 0-30 yr), were 46% female (13/28), and 96% white (27/28). A novel conceptual model emerged that related the difficulty of the decision about intracranial pressure monitor placement (y-axis) with the estimated outcome of the patient (x-axis). This model had a bimodal shape, with the most difficult decisions occurring for patients who 1) had a good opportunity for recovery but whose neurologic examination had not yet normalized or 2) had a low but uncertain likelihood of neurologically functional recovery. Emergent themes included gaps in medical knowledge and information available for decision-making, differences in perspective between clinical specialties, and ethical implications of decision-making about intracranial pressure monitoring. Experienced clinicians described less difficulty with decision-making overall.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with severe traumatic brain injury near perceived transition points along a spectrum of potential for recovery present challenges for decision-making about intracranial pressure monitor placement. Clinician experience and specialty discipline further influence decision-making. These findings will contribute to the design of a multidisciplinary clinical decision support tool for intracranial pressure monitor placement in children with traumatic brain injury.},

@article{Ahmed2018,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because pediatric trauma-related mortality continue to decline, metrics assessing morbidity are needed to evaluate the impact of treatment after injury. Based of its value for assessing children with traumatic brain injuries and other critical illnesses, Functional Status Scale (FSS), a tool that measures function in six domains (communication, feeding, mental, motor, sensory and respiratory), was evaluated as an outcome measure for the overall population of injured children.
METHODS: Children with at least one injury (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] severity ≥1) surviving to discharge between December 2011 and April 2013 were identified in a previous study of intensive care unit admissions. Morbidity was defined as additional morbidity in any domain (domain FSS change ≥2) and additional overall morbidity (total FSS change ≥3 or 'new domain morbidity') between preinjury status and discharge. Associations between injury profiles and the development of morbidity were analyzed.
RESULTS: We identified 553 injured children, with an average of 2.0 $\pm$ 1.9 injuries. New domain and overall morbidity were observed in 17.0% and 11.0% of patients, respectively. New domain morbidity was associated with an increasing number of body regions with an injury with AIS≥ 2 (P<0.001), with severe (AIS ≥ 4) head (P=0.04) and spine (P=0.01) injuries and with at moderately severe (AIS ≥ 2) lower extremity injuries (P=0.01). New domain morbidity was more common among patients with severe spine and lower extremity injuries (55.6% and 48.7%, respectively), with greatest impact in the motor domain (55.6% and 43.6%, respectively). New domain morbidity was associated with increasing ISS, number of moderately severe injuries and number of body regions with more than a moderately severe injury (P<0.001 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher morbidity measured by the FSS is associated with increasing injury severity. These findings support the use of the FSS as a metric for assessing outcome after pediatric injury.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between the Functional Status Scale and Pediatric Functional Independence Measure scores during the rehabilitation stay in children who survive traumatic brain injury.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital with a level 1 trauma center and inpatient rehabilitation service.
PATIENTS: Sixty-five children less than 18 years old admitted to an ICU with acute traumatic brain injury and subsequently transferred to the inpatient rehabilitation service.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Functional Status Scale and Pediatric Functional Independence Measure at transfer to rehabilitation and Pediatric Functional Independence Measure at discharge from rehabilitation. The median age of the cohort was 7.1 years (interquartile range, 0.8-12.3 yr), and 29% were female. Nearly all of the children were healthy prior to the traumatic brain injury: six patients (9.2%) had a baseline Functional Status Scale score greater than 6. At the time of transfer to inpatient rehabilitation, total Functional Status Scale and Pediatric Functional Independence Measure scores had the expected negative correlation due to increasing disability resulting in lower scores in Pediatric Functional Independence Measure and higher scores in Functional Status Scale (r = -0.49; 95% CI, -0.62 to -0.35). Among subjects with less disability as measured by lower total Functional Status Scale scores, we found substantial variability in the total Pediatric Functional Independence Measure scores. In contrast, Pediatric Functional Independence Measure scores were consistently low among subjects with a wide range of higher total Functional Status Scale scores (more disability).
CONCLUSIONS: Although proprietary and more time-intensive, the Pediatric Functional Independence Measure has advantages relative to the Functional Status Scale for less severely injured patients and task-specific measurements. The Functional Status Scale may have advantages relative to the Pediatric Functional Independence Measure for more severely injured patients. Further investigations are needed to characterize changes in the Functional Status Scale during the rehabilitation stay and after discharge.},

@article{Sarnaik2018,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although small series have suggested that younger age is associated with less favorable outcome after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), confounders and biases have limited our understanding of this relationship. We hypothesized that there would be an association between age and mortality in children within an ongoing observational, cohort study.
METHODS: The first 200 subjects from the Approaches and Decisions for Acute Pediatric TBI trial were eligible for this analysis (inclusion criteria: severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score ≤ 8], age 18 years, and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor placed; exclusion: pregnancy). Children with suspected abusive head trauma (AHT) were excluded to avoid bias related to the association between AHT and mortality. Demographics, and prehospital and resuscitation events were collected/analyzed, and children were stratified based on age at time of injury (< 5, 5-< 11, 11-18 years) and presented as mean $\pm$ standard error of the mean (SEM). Analyses of variance were used to test the equality of the means across the group for continuous variable, and Chi-square tests were used to compare percentages for discrete variables (post hoc comparisons were made using t test and Bonferroni corrections, as needed). Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for each age subgroup describing the time of death, and log-rank was used to compare the curves. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the effect of age on time to death while controlling for covariates.
RESULTS: In the final cohort (n = 155, 45 excluded for AHT), overall age was 9.2 years $\pm$ 0.4 and GCS was 5.3 $\pm$ 0.1. Mortality was similar between strata (14.0, 20.0, 20.9%, respectively, p = 0.58). Motor vehicle accidents were the most common mechanism across all strata, while falls tended to be more common in the youngest stratum (p = 0.08). The youngest stratum demonstrated increased incidence of spontaneous hypothermia at presentation and decreased hemoglobin concentrations and coagulopathies, while the oldest demonstrated lower platelet counts.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous reports, we failed to detect mortality differences across age strata in children with severe TBI. We have discerned novel associations between age and various markers of injury-unrelated to AHT-that may lead to testable hypotheses in the future.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate, etiology, and timing of unplanned and planned hospital readmissions and to identify risk factors for unplanned readmission in children who survive a hospitalization for trauma.
DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study of a probabilistically linked dataset from the National Trauma Data Bank and the Pediatric Health Information System database, 2007-2012.
SETTING: Twenty-nine U.S. children's hospitals.
PATIENTS: 51,591 children (< 18 yr at admission) who survived more than or equal to a 2-day hospitalization for trauma.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was unplanned readmission within 1 year of discharge from the injury hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included any readmission, reason for readmission, time to readmission, and number of readmissions within 1 year of discharge. The primary exposure groups were isolated traumatic brain injury, both traumatic brain injury and other injury, or nontraumatic brain injury only. We hypothesized a priori that any traumatic brain injury would be associated with both planned and unplanned hospital readmission. We used All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups codes to categorize readmissions by etiology and planned or unplanned. Overall, 4,301/49,982 of the patients (8.6%) with more than or equal to 1 year of observation time were readmitted to the same hospital within 1 year. Many readmissions were unplanned: 2,704/49,982 (5.4%) experienced an unplanned readmission in the first year. The most common reason for unplanned readmission was infection (22%), primarily postoperative or posttraumatic infection (38% of readmissions for infection). Traumatic brain injury was associated with lower odds of unplanned readmission in multivariable analyses. Seizure or RBC transfusion during the index hospitalization were the strongest predictors of unplanned, earlier, and multiple readmissions.
CONCLUSIONS: Many survivors of pediatric trauma experience unplanned, and potentially preventable, hospital readmissions in the year after discharge. Identification of those at highest risk of readmission can guide targeted in-hospital or postdischarge interventions.},

	abstract = {The purposes of this study, in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI), to describe cervical spine imaging practice, to assess for recent changes in imaging practice, and to determine whether cervical spine computed tomography (CT) is being used in children at low risk for cervical spine injury.The setting was children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database, from January 2001 to June 2011. Participants were children (younger than 18 y) with TBI who were evaluated in the emergency department, admitted to the hospital, and received a head CT scan on the day of admission. The primary outcome measures were cervical spine imaging studies. This study was exempted from institutional review board assessment.A total of 30,112 children met study criteria. Overall, 52\% (15,687/30,112) received cervical spine imaging. The use of cervical spine radiographs alone decreased between 2001 (47\%) and 2011 (23\%), with an annual decrease of 2.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.1\%-3.3\%), and was largely replaced by an increased use of CT, with or without radiographs (8.6\% in 2001 and 19.5\% in 2011, with an annual increase of 0.9\%; 95\% CI, 0.1\%-1.8\%). A total of 2545 children received cervical spine CT despite being discharged alive from the hospital in less than 72 hours, and 1655 of those had a low-risk mechanism of injury.The adoption of CT clearance of the cervical spine in adults seems to have influenced the care of children with TBI, despite concerns about radiation exposure.},

	abstract = {Record linkage may create powerful datasets with which investigators can conduct comparative effectiveness studies evaluating the impact of tests or interventions on health. All linkages of health care data files to date have used protected health information (PHI) in their linkage variables. A technique to link datasets without using PHI would be advantageous both to preserve privacy and to increase the number of potential linkages.We applied probabilistic linkage to records of injured children in the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB, N = 156,357) and the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS, N = 104,049) databases from 2007 to 2010. 49 match variables without PHI were used, many of them administrative variables and indicators for procedures recorded as International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification codes. We validated the accuracy of the linkage using identified data from a single center that submits to both databases.We accurately linked the PHIS and NTDB records for 69\% of children with any injury, and 88\% of those with severe traumatic brain injury eligible for a study of intervention effectiveness (positive predictive value of 98\%, specificity of 99.99\%). Accurate linkage was associated with longer lengths of stay, more severe injuries, and multiple injuries.In populations with substantial illness or injury severity, accurate record linkage may be possible in the absence of PHI. This methodology may enable linkages and, in turn, comparative effectiveness studies that would be unlikely or impossible otherwise.},

Participants had International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes for MAS and either SLE or JIA. The primary outcome was hospital mortality (for the index admission). Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admission, critical care interventions, and medication use.A total of 121 children at 28 children's hospitals met the inclusion criteria, including 19 children with SLE and 102 children with JIA. The index admission mortality rate was 7\% (8 of 121 patients). ICU admission (33\%), mechanical ventilation (26\%), and inotrope/vasopressor therapy (26\%) were common. Compared to children with JIA, those with SLE had a similar mortality rate (6\% versus 11\%, respectively; exact P = 0.6). More patients with SLE than those with JIA received ICU care (63\% versus 27\%; P = 0.002), received mechanical ventilation (53\% versus 21\%; P = 0.003), and had cardiovascular dysfunction (47\% versus 23\% received inotrope/vasopressor therapy; P = 0.02). Children with SLE and those with JIA received cyclosporine at similar rates, but more children with SLE received cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil, and more children with JIA received interleukin-1 antagonists.Organ system dysfunction is common in children with rheumatic diseases complicated by MAS, and more organ system support is required in children with underlying SLE than in children with JIA. Current treatment of pediatric MAS varies based on the underlying rheumatic disease.},

MAIN ANALYSIS: Cox regression.The predictor of interest was the patient-specific peak serum ferritin level, dichotomized a priori at 3000 ng/mL. The outcomes were mortality and intensive care unit admission. A total of 171 patients met the inclusion criteria. The observation time without death or intensive care unit admission ranged from 184 to 1621 days. The hazard ratio of death with peak ferritin of >3000 ng/mL was 4.32 (95\% confidence interval 2.21-8.47, p < .001) compared to peak ferritin of 1000-3000 ng/mL. The hazard ratio of intensive care unit admission with peak ferritin of >3000 ng/mL was 2.49 (95\% confidence interval 1.53-4.05, p < .001) compared to peak ferritin of 1000-3000 ng/mL. Both estimates were adjusted for bone marrow transplant, solid organ transplant, hemoglobinopathy, and existing rheumatologic disease.In this pediatric population, with serum ferritin levels of >3000 ng/mL, there was increased risk for both receipt of critical care and subsequent death.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanism, crash characteristics, and spectrum of lower extremity injuries in children restrained in forward-facing car seats during front and rear impacts have not been described. METHODS: We identified in two databases children who sustained lower extremity injuries while restrained in forward-facing car seats. To identify the mechanism, we analyzed crash reconstructions from three frontal-impact cases from the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network. To further describe the crash and injury characteristics we evaluated children between 1 and 4 years of age with lower extremity injuries from front or rear impacts in the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) database. RESULTS: Crash reconstruction data demonstrated that the likely mechanism of lower extremity injury was contact between the legs and the front seatbacks. In the CDS database, we identified 15 children with lower extremity injuries in a forward-facing child seat, usually (13 out of 15) placed in the rear seat, incurred in frontal impacts (11 out of 15). Several (5 out of 15) children were in unbelted or improperly secured forward-facing car seats. Injury Severity Scores varied widely (5-50). CONCLUSIONS: Children in forward-facing car seats involved in severe front or rear crashes may incur a range of lower extremity injury from impact with the car interior component in front of them. Crash scene photography can provide useful information about anatomic sites at risk for injury and alert emergency department providers to possible subtle injury.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to determine the effect of birth hospital pediatric cardiac specialty center status and neonatal level of care on 90-day mortality for infants with ductal-dependent congenital heart disease. METHODS: A population-based, retrospective, cohort study was conducted in Washington State in 1987-2006. All infants born in Washington with gestational ages of >/=32 weeks and birth weights of >/=1500 g who were admitted to a Washington hospital for the care of a congenital cardiac anomaly likely to be ductal dependent were included. Subjects were required to receive a surgical or interventional cardiac procedure within 30 days after birth. Birth certificate data were linked with death certificate data and hospital administrative records. The exposures of interest were birth hospital pediatric cardiac specialty center status and neonatal level of care. The primary outcome was death within 90 days. RESULTS: A total of 823 infants met the inclusion criteria, 285 born at specialty centers and 538 at other centers. After adjustment for cardiac diagnoses, other congenital anomalies, birth year, maternal income quartile, and definitive-care hospital, there was no significant difference in 90-day mortality for infants born at specialty centers versus other centers (odds ratio: 1.05 [95% confidence interval: 0.65-1.68]). CONCLUSION: For infants with ductal-dependent congenital heart disease, there was no difference in 90-day mortality for infants born at specialty centers versus other centers in the state of Washington.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: (1) To determine factors associated with physical therapy (PT) or occupational therapy (OT) evaluation and speech or swallow therapy evaluation in hospitalized children with traumatic brain injury (TBI); (2) to describe when during the hospital stay the initial therapy evaluations typically occur; and (3) to quantify any between-hospital variation in therapy evaluation. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database (January 2001-June 2011). PARTICIPANTS: Children (age <18y) with TBI (N=21,399) who were admitted to the intensive care unit and survived to hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PT or OT evaluation and speech or swallow therapy evaluation. A propensity score was calculated to allow comparison of expected with observed rates of therapy evaluations by the hospital. RESULTS: The median hospital length of stay was 5 days (interquartile range, 3-10d). Overall, 8748 (41%) of 21,399 children received either a PT or OT evaluation, and 5490 (26%) out of 21,399 children received either a speech or swallow evaluation. Older children and those with higher energy injury mechanisms, more severe injuries, extremity fractures, more treatment with neuromuscular blocking agents or pentobarbital, and admission to a hospital with an American College of Surgeons Level I pediatric trauma designation were more likely to receive therapy evaluations. The median time until the first therapy evaluation was 5 (PT or OT) and 7 days (speech or swallow). Expected hospital evaluation rates were 25% to 54% (PT or OT) and 16% to 35% (speech or swallow), while observed hospital evaluation rates were 11% to 74% (PT or OT) and 4% to 55% (speech or swallow). CONCLUSIONS: There is wide between-hospital variation in provision of rehabilitation therapies for children with TBI. Evidence-based criteria for initiation of routine therapy evaluations after TBI are needed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe between-hospital and patient-level variation in intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and to evaluate ICP monitoring in association with hospital features and outcome in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database (January 2001 to June 2011). PARTICIPANTS: Children (aged <18 years) with TBI and head Abbreviated Injury Scale scores of at least 3 who were ventilated for at least 96 consecutive hours or who died in the first 4 days after hospital admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Monitoring of ICP. RESULTS: A total of 4667 children met the study criteria. Hospital mortality was 41% (n = 1919). Overall, 55% of patients (n = 2586) received ICP monitoring. Expected hospital ICP monitoring rates after adjustment for patient age, cardiac arrest, inflicted injury, craniotomy or craniectomy, head Abbreviated Injury Scale score, and Injury Severity Score were 47% to 60%. Observed hospital ICP monitoring rates were 14% to 83%. Hospitals with more observed ICP monitoring, relative to expected, and hospitals with higher patient volumes had lower rates of mortality or severe disability. After adjustment for between-hospital variation and patient severity of injury, ICP monitoring was independently associated with age 1 year and older (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.5-3.8) vs age younger than 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: There was significant between-hospital variation in ICP monitoring that cannot be attributed solely to differences in case mix. Hospitals that monitor ICP more frequently and hospitals with higher patient volumes had better patient outcomes. Infants with TBI are less likely to receive ICP monitoring than are older children.},

We conducted a narrative review of the medical literature, categorized the data sources available to PCCM investigators, and created an online data source registry. We found that many data sources are available for research in PCCM. To date, PCCM investigators have most often relied on pediatric critical care registries and treatment- or disease-specific registries. The available data sources vary widely in the level of clinical detail and the types of questions they can reliably answer. Linkage of data sources can expand the types of questions that a data source can be used to study. Careful matching of the scientific question to the best available data source or linked data sources is necessary. In addition, rigorous application of the best available analysis techniques and reporting consistent with observational research standards will maximize the quality of research using existing data in PCCM.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe patterns of use for mannitol and hypertonic saline in children with traumatic brain injury, to evaluate any potential associations between hypertonic saline and mannitol use and patient demographic, injury, and treatment hospital characteristics, and to determine whether the 2003 guidelines for severe pediatric traumatic brain injury impacted clinical practice regarding osmolar therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Pediatric Health Information System database, January, 2001 to December, 2008. PATIENTS: Children (age <18 yrs) with traumatic brain injury and head/neck Abbreviated Injury Scale score >/= 3 who received mechanical ventilation and intensive care. INTERVENTIONS: : None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was hospital billing for parenteral hypertonic saline and mannitol use, by day of service. Overall, 33% (2,069 of 6,238) of the patients received hypertonic saline, and 40% (2,500 of 6,238) received mannitol. Of the 1,854 patients who received hypertonic saline or mannitol for >/= 2 days in the first week of therapy, 29% did not have intracranial pressure monitoring. After adjustment for hospital-level variation, primary insurance payer, and overall injury severity, use of both drugs was independently associated with older patient age, intracranial hemorrhage (other than epidural), skull fracture, and higher head/neck injury severity. Hypertonic saline use increased and mannitol use decreased with publication of the 2003 guidelines, and these trends continued through 2008. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertonic saline and mannitol are used less in infants than in older children. The patient-level and hospital-level variation in osmolar therapy use and the substantial amount of sustained osmolar therapy without intracranial pressure monitoring suggest opportunities to improve the quality of pediatric traumatic brain injury care. With limited high-quality evidence available, published expert guidelines appear to significantly impact clinical practice in this area.},

We assessed the ventilator-associated events algorithm in pediatric patients.A retrospective observational cohort study.This single-center study took place in a PICU at an urban academic medical facility.Pediatric (ages 0-18 yr old) trauma patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury ventilated for greater than or equal to 2 days.We assessed for pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia (as defined by current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PNU2 guidelines), adult ventilator-associated events, and an experimental ventilator-associated events definition modified for pediatric patients. We compared ventilator-associated events to ventilator-associated pneumonia to calculate the test characteristics. Thirty-nine of 119 patients (33\%) developed ventilator-associated pneumonia. Sensitivity of the adult ventilator-associated condition definition was 23\% (95\% CI, 11-39\%), which increased to 56\% (95\% CI, 40-72\%) using the modified pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia criterion. Specificity reached 100\% for both original and modified pediatric probable ventilator-associated pneumonia using ventilator-associated events criteria. Children who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia or ventilator-associated condition had similar baseline characteristics: age, mechanism of injury, injury severity scores, and use of an intracranial pressure monitor. Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated condition portended similarly unfavorable outcomes: longer median duration of ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and more discharges to rehabilitation, home health, or nursing care compared with patients with no pulmonary complication.Both current and modified ventilator-associated events criteria have poor sensitivity but good specificity in identifying pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia. Despite poor sensitivity, the high specificity of the ventilator-associated events diagnoses does provide a useful and objective metric for interinstitution ICU comparison. Ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated condition were both associated with excess morbidity in pediatric traumatic brain injury patients.},

Little is known about the relationship between a center's case volume and patient mortality. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation annual volume and in-hospital mortality and assess if a minimum hospital volume could be recommended.Retrospective cohort study.A retrospective cohort admitted to children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System database from 2004 to 2011 supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was identified. Indications were assigned based on patient age (neonatal vs pediatric), diagnosis, and procedure codes. Average hospital annual volume was defined as 0-19, 20-49, or greater than or equal to 50 cases per year. Maximum likelihood estimates were used to assess minimum annual case volume.A total of 7,322 pediatric patients aged 0-18 were supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and had an indication assigned.None.Average hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation volume ranged from 1 to 58 cases per year. Overall mortality was 43\% but differed significantly by indication. After adjustment for case-mix, complexity of cardiac surgery, and year of treatment, patients treated at medium-volume centers (odds ratio, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.75-0.98) and high-volume centers (odds ratio, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.63-0.89) had significantly lower odds of death compared with those treated at low-volume centers. The minimum annual case load most significantly associated with lower mortality was 22 (95\% CI, 22-28).Pediatric centers with low extracorporeal membrane oxygenation average annual case volume had significantly higher mortality and a minimum volume of 22 cases per year was associated with improved mortality.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Utah state trauma audit filters assess expeditious care at referring emergency departments for severely injured patients to avoid delays in transfer. We evaluated two state performance measures related to pediatric trauma care before arrival at the Level I trauma center. METHODS: Analysis of the Primary Children's Medical Center (PCMC) trauma database for children with Injury Severity Scores (ISS)>15 from 2006 to 2009 was performed. Patient care was evaluated for referring hospital emergency department triage time of <2 hours and total transfer time of </=6 hours for rural and </=4 hours for urban place of injury. RESULTS: Four hundred twelve patients with ISS>15 were admitted via interhospital transfer from within Utah. Approximately 50% of patients were triaged<2 hours, which increased to almost two thirds when restricted to those initially evaluated within 100 miles (helicopter range) of PCMC. Factors associated with delayed triaged included lower ISS, less severe head injury, greater distance from the trauma center, and primary chest/abdominal injuries. Death and poor outcome did not differ significantly by triage in <2 hours or >/=2 hours. Adherence with the total transfer time goal was 94% for rural and 76% for urban place of injury. CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial nonadherence with trauma performance measures for triage in <2 hours among pediatric trauma patients with ISS >15. Because of low rates of poor outcome, we are unable to determine whether adherence with state triage goals lessens morbidity or mortality.},

However, little is known about the epidemiology, risk factors, and microbiology of VAP in pediatric TBI. We reviewed a cohort of 119 pediatric moderate-to-severe TBI patients and identified 42 with VAP by positive protected bronchial brush specimens. Location of intubation, severity of injury, and antibiotic administration within 2 days after injury were not associated with VAP. Most treatments for elevated intracranial pressure were associated with increased risk of VAP; however, in a multi-variable analysis barbiturate coma (hazard ratio [HR], 3.2; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-7.3), neuromuscular blockade (NMBA; HR, 3.4; 95\% CI 1.6-7.3), and use of a cooling blanket for euthermia (HR 2.4; 95\% CI 1.1-5.5) remained independently associated with VAP. Most VAP (55\%) occurred prior to hospital Day 4 and only 7\% developed VAP after Day 7. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (34\%), Haemophilus influenzae (22\%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (15\%) were the most common organisms, comprising 71\% of isolated pathogens (36\% of infections were polymicrobial). Patients with VAP had significantly longer intensive care unit and hospital stays, as well as increased risk of chronic care needs after discharge, but not mortality. VAP is a common occurrence in pediatric TBI patients, and early empiric therapy for patients requiring barbiturate infusion, NMBA, or use of a cooling blanket could mitigate morbidity.},

	abstract = {Early posttraumatic seizures may contribute to worsened outcomes after traumatic brain injury. Evidence to guide the evaluation and management of early posttraumatic seizures in children is limited. We undertook a survey of current practices of continuous electroencephalographic monitoring, seizure prophylaxis, and the management of early posttraumatic seizures to provide essential information for trial design and the development of posttraumatic seizure management pathways.Surveys were sent to site principal investigators at all 43 sites participating in the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI trial at the time of the survey. Surveys consisted of 12 questions addressing strategies to 1) implement continuous electroencephalographic monitoring, 2) posttraumatic seizure prophylaxis, 3) treat acute posttraumatic seizures, 4) treat status epilepticus and refractory status epilepticus, and 5) monitor antiseizure drug levels.Institutions comprised a mixture of free-standing children's hospitals and university medical centers across the United States and Europe.Site principal investigators of the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI trial.None.Continuous electroencephalographic monitoring was available in the PICU in the overwhelming majority of clinical sites (98\%); however, the plans to operationalize such monitoring for children varied considerably. A similar majority of sites report that administration of prophylactic antiseizure medications is anticipated in children (93\%); yet, a minority reports that a specified protocol for treatment of posttraumatic seizures is in place (43\%). Reported medication choices varied substantially between sites, but the majority of sites reported pentobarbital for refractory status epilepticus (81\%). The presence of treatment protocols for seizure prophylaxis, early posttraumatic seizures, posttraumatic status epilepticus, and refractory status epilepticus was associated with decreased reported medications (all p < 0.05).This study reports the current management practices for early posttraumatic seizures in select academic centers after pediatric severe traumatic brain injury. The substantial variation in continuous electroencephalographic monitoring implementation, choice of seizure prophylaxis medications, and management of early posttraumatic seizures across institutions was reported, signifying the areas of clinical uncertainty that will help provide focused design of clinical trials. Although sites with treatment protocols reported a decreased number of medications for the scenarios described, completion of the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI trial will be able to determine if these protocols lead to decreased variability in medication administration in children at the clinical sites.},

The objective of this study was to determine whether the Rotterdam CT score can be used for mortality risk stratification after pediatric traumatic brain injury.In children with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, a comparison of observed versus predicted mortality was calculated using published model probabilities of adult mortality. Development and validation of a new pediatric mortality model using randomly selected prediction and validation samples from our cohort.A single level 1 pediatric trauma center.Six hundred thirty-two children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury.None.Sixteen percent of the patients (101 of 632) died prior to hospital discharge. The predicted mortality based on Rotterdam score for adults with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury discriminated pediatric observed mortality well (area under the curve = 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.89) but had poor calibration, overestimating or underestimating mortality for children in several Rotterdam categories. A predictive model based on children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury from the single center discriminated mortality well (area under the curve, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.68-0.91) and showed good calibration and overall fit.Children with traumatic brain injury have better survival than adults in Rotterdam CT score categories representing less severe injuries but worse survival than adults in higher score categories. A novel, validated pediatric mortality model based on the Rotterdam score is accurate in children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury and can be used for risk stratification.},

	abstract = {Optimal stimulation and prevention of anergy in T cells requires signaling through the CD28 molecule. During HIV disease progression, CD28 expression is lost, particularly on CD8+ T cells. Because alterations in cytokine production patterns occur during HIV infection, we determined whether CD8+ T cell phenotype or function was affected by cytokine environment. Treatment of CD8+ T cells with IL-4 decreased levels of both CD28 surface expression and message and increased CD8 expression. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells that had down-regulated CD28 had reduced proliferative capacity. The inhibitory effects of CD28 reduction could be compensated either by increased anti-CD3 or by exogenous IL-2, suggesting that the strength of T cell signaling necessary for the production of IL-2 and subsequent proliferation is negatively regulated by IL-4. CD8+ subpopulations with differential CD28 expression produced different patterns of cytokines, particularly IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells that had reduced CD28 levels but made their own IL-2 were able to proliferate in response to TCR stimulation. These results suggest that loss of CD28 expression and CD8 T cell function can be regulated by the cytokine environment, which may be altered during HIV disease progression. Whether the dysfunction of CD8+ T cells in HIV infection occurs by such a mechanism is the subject of future investigation.},

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the practice of FP during tracheal intubation (TI) in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Family presence during procedures in PICUs has been advocated.To describe the current practice of FP during TI and evaluate the association with procedural and clinician (including physician, respiratory therapist, and nurse practitioner) outcomes across multiple PICUs.Prospective cohort study in which all TIs from July 2010 to March 2014 in the multicenter TI database (National Emergency Airway Registry for Children [NEAR4KIDS]) were analyzed. Family presence was defined as a family member present during TI. This study included all TIs in patients younger than 18 years in 22 international PICUs.Family presence and no FP during TI in the PICU.The percentage of FP during TIs. First attempt success rate, adverse TI-associated events, multiple attempts (≥ 3), oxygen desaturation (oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry <80\%), and self-reported team stress level.A total of 4969 TI encounters were reported. Among those, 81\% (n = 4030) of TIs had documented FP status (with/without). The median age of participants with FP was 2 years and 1 year for those without FP. The average percentage of TIs with FP was 19\% and varied widely across sites (0\%-43\%; P < .001). Tracheal intubations with FP (vs without FP) were associated with older patients (median, 2 years vs 1 year; P = .04), lower Paediatric Index of Mortality 2 score, and pediatric resident as the first airway clinician (23\%, n = 179 vs 18\%, n = 584; odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.2-1.7). Tracheal intubations with FP and without FP were no different in the first attempt success rate (OR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.18), adverse TI-associated events (any events: OR, 1.06; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.30 and severe events: OR, 1.04; 95\% CI, 0.75-1.43), multiple attempts (≥ 3) (OR, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.82-1.28), oxygen desaturation (oxygen saturation <80\%) (OR, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.80-1.18), or self-reported team stress level (OR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.92-1.31). This result persisted after adjusting for patient and clinician confounders.Wide variability exists in FP during TIs across PICUs. Family presence was not associated with first attempt success, adverse TI-associated events, oxygen desaturation (<80\%), or higher team stress level. Our data suggest that FP during TI can safely be implemented as part of a family-centered care model in the PICU.},

	abstract = {In children with traumatic brain injury, 1) to describe the hospital discharge functional outcome and change from baseline function using the Functional Status Scale and 2) to determine any associations between discharge Functional Status Scale and age, injury mechanism, neurologic examination, imaging, and other predictors of outcome. Prospective observational cohort study, May 2013 to November 2015. Two U.S. children's hospitals designated as American College of Surgeons level 1 pediatric trauma centers. Children less than 18 years old admitted to an ICU with acute traumatic brain injury and either a surgical or critical care intervention within the first 24 hours or in-hospital mortality. None. The primary outcome was hospital discharge Functional Status Scale. Most, 133 of 196 (68%), had severe traumatic brain injury (admission Glasgow Coma Scale, 3-8). Overall hospital mortality was 14%; 20% among those with severe traumatic brain injury. Hospital discharge Functional Status Scale had an inverse relationship with Glasgow Coma Scale: for each increase in admission Glasgow Coma Scale by 1, the discharge Functional Status Scale decreased by 0.5 (95% CI, 0.7-0.3). Baseline Functional Status Scale was collected at one site (n = 75). At that site, nearly all (61/62) of the survivors had normal or near-normal (≤ 7) preinjury Functional Status Scale. More than one-third, 23 of 62 (37%), of survivors had new morbidity at hospital discharge (increase in Functional Status Scale, ≥ 3). Among children with severe traumatic brain injury who had baseline Functional Status Scale collected, 21 of 41 survivors (51%) had new morbidity at hospital discharge. The mean change in Functional Status Scale from baseline to hospital discharge was 3.9 $\pm$ 4.9 overall and 5.2 $\pm$ 5.4 in children with severe traumatic brain injury. More than one-third of survivors, and approximately half of survivors with severe traumatic brain injury, will have new morbidity. Hospital discharge Functional Status Scale, change from baseline Functional Status Scale, and new morbidity acquisition can be used as outcome measures for hospital-based care process improvement initiatives and interventional studies of children with traumatic brain injury.},

Prospective observational cohort study, May 2013 to September 2015. Two large U.S. children's hospitals with level 1 Pediatric Trauma Centers. One hundred seventy-four children less than 18 years old admitted to an ICU after traumatic brain injury. Prospective data were linked to database codes for each patient. The outcomes were prospectively identified acute traumatic brain injury, intracranial pressure monitor placement, craniotomy or craniectomy, vascular catheter placement, invasive mechanical ventilation, and new gastrostomy tube or tracheostomy placement. Candidate predictors were database codes present in administrative, billing, or trauma registry data. For each clinical event, we developed and validated penalized regression and Boolean classifiers (models to identify clinical events that take database codes as predictors). We externally validated the best model for each clinical event. The primary model performance measure was accuracy, the percent of test patients correctly classified. The cohort included 174 children who required ICU admission after traumatic brain injury. Simple Boolean classifiers were greater than or equal to 94% accurate for seven of nine clinical diagnoses and events. For central venous catheter placement, no classifier achieved 90% accuracy. Classifier accuracy was dependent on available data fields. Five of nine classifiers were acceptably accurate using only administrative data but three required trauma registry fields and two required billing data. In children with traumatic brain injury, computable phenotypes based on simple Boolean classifiers were highly accurate for most neurosurgical and critical care diagnoses and events. The computable phenotypes we developed and validated can be used in any observational study of children with traumatic brain injury and can reasonably be applied in studies of these interventions in other patient populations.},

Posttraumatic seizures risk factors are not completely understood. Our objective was to clarify posttraumatic seizures risk factors in a large cohort of children with severe traumatic brain injury. Retrospective cohort study of a probabilistically linked dataset from the National Trauma Data Bank and the Pediatric Health Information Systems database, 2007-2010. Twenty-nine U.S. children's hospitals. A total of 2,122 children (age, < 18 yr old at admission) with linked National Trauma Data Bank and Pediatric Health Information Systems records, severe (emergency department Glasgow Coma Scale, < 8) traumatic brain injury, hospital length of stay more than 24 hours, and nonmissing disposition. None. The outcome was posttraumatic seizures, identified using validated International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. Prespecified candidate predictors of posttraumatic seizures included age, injury mechanism, emergency department Glasgow Coma Scale, intracranial hemorrhage type, hypoxia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. Posttraumatic seizures were diagnosed in 25.2% of children with severe traumatic brain injury. In those without abuse/assault or subdural hemorrhage, the posttraumatic seizures rate varied between 36.6% in those less than 2 years old and 16.4% in those 14-17 years old. Age, abusive mechanism, and subdural hemorrhage are each significant predictors of posttraumatic seizures. The risk of posttraumatic seizures has a complex relationship with these predictors. The estimated odds of posttraumatic seizures decrease with advancing age, odds ratio equal to 0.929 (0.905-0.954) per additional year of age with no abuse/assault and no subdural hemorrhage; odds ratio equal to 0.820 (0.730-0.922) per additional year of age when abuse and subdural hemorrhage are present. An infant with accidental traumatic brain injury and subdural hemorrhage has approximately the same estimated probability of posttraumatic seizures as an abused infant without subdural hemorrhage (47% [95% CI, 39-55%] vs 50% [95% CI, 41-58%]; p = 0.69). The triad of young age, injury by abuse/assault, and subdural hemorrhage confers the greatest estimated probability for posttraumatic seizures (60% [95% CI, 53-66%]). Posttraumatic seizures risk in children with severe traumatic brain injury is greatest with a triad of younger age, injury by abuse/assault, and subdural hemorrhage. However, posttraumatic seizures are common even in the absence of these factors.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the ongoing mortality risk and healthcare utilization among U.S. children after discharge from a hospitalization involving ICU care. We sought to understand risks for hospital readmission and trends in mortality during the year following ICU discharge. Retrospective observational cohort study. This study was performed using administrative claims data from 2006-2013 obtained from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Database. We included all children in the dataset admitted to a U.S. ICU less than or equal to 18 years old. The primary outcome was nonelective readmission in the year following discharge. Risk of rehospitalization was determined using a Cox proportional hazards model. We identified 109,130 children with at least one ICU admission in the dataset. Over three quarters of the index ICU admissions (78.6%) had an ICU length of stay less than or equal to 3 days, and the overall index hospitalization mortality rate was 1.4%. In multivariate analysis, risk of nonelective readmission for children without cancer was higher with longer index ICU admission length of stay, younger age, and several chronic and acute conditions. By the end of the 1-year observation period, 36.0% of children with an index ICU length of stay greater than or equal to 14 days had been readmitted, compared with only 13.9% of children who had an index ICU length of stay equals to 1 day. Mortality in the year after ICU discharge was low overall (106 deaths per 10,000 person-years of observation) but was high among children with an initial index ICU admission length of stay greater than or equal to 14 days (599 deaths per 10,000 person-years). Readmission after ICU care is common. Further research is needed to investigate the potentially modifiable factors affecting likelihood of readmissions after discharge from the ICU. Although late mortality was relatively uncommon overall, it was 10-fold higher in the year after ICU discharge than in the general U.S. pediatric population.},

Post-traumatic seizures (PTS) occur in 11-42% of children with severe TBI and are associated with unfavorable outcome. Electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring may be used to detect PTS and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may be used to treat PTS, but national rates of EEG and AED use are not known. The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency and timing of EEG and AED use in children hospitalized after severe TBI. Retrospective cohort study of 2165 children at 30 hospitals in a probabilistically linked dataset from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) and the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database, 2007-2010. We included children (age <18 years old at admission) with linked NTDB and PHIS records, severe (Emergency Department [ED] Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] <8) TBI, hospital length of stay >24 h, and non-missing disposition. The primary outcomes were EEG and AED use. Overall, 31.8% of the cohort had EEG monitoring. Of those, 21.8% were monitored on the first hospital day. The median duration of EEG monitoring was 2.0 (IQR 1.0, 4.0) days. AEDs were prescribed to 52.0% of the cohort, of whom 61.8% received an AED on the first hospital day. The median duration of AED use was 8.0 (IQR 4.0, 17.0) days. EEG monitoring and AED use were more frequent in children with known risk factors for PTS. EEG monitoring and AED use were not related to hospital TBI volume. EEG use is relatively uncommon in children with severe TBI, but AEDs are frequently prescribed. EEG monitoring and AED use are more common in children with known risk factors for PTS.},

	abstract = {To identify historical and clinical findings at emergency department presentation associated with severe H1N1 outcome in children presenting with influenza-like illness.Multicentre retrospective case-control study.79 emergency departments of hospitals associated with the Pediatric Emergency Research Networks in 12 countries.265 children (<16 years), presenting between 16 April and 31 December 2009, who fulfilled Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for influenza-like illness and developed severe outcomes from laboratory confirmed H1N1 infection. For each case, two controls presenting with influenza-like illness but without severe outcomes were included: one random control and one age matched control.Severe outcomes included death or admission to intensive care for assisted ventilation, inotropic support, or both. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to compare cases and controls, with effect sizes measured as adjusted odds ratios.151 (57\%) of the 265 cases were male, the median age was 6 (interquartile range 2.3-10.0) years, and 27 (10\%) died. Six factors were associated with severe outcomes in children presenting with influenza-like illness: history of chronic lung disease (odds ratio 10.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.5 to 69.8), history of cerebral palsy/developmental delay (10.2, 2.0 to 51.4), signs of chest retractions (9.6, 3.2 to 29.0), signs of dehydration (8.8, 1.6 to 49.3), requirement for oxygen (5.8, 2.0 to 16.2), and tachycardia relative to age).These independent risk factors may alert clinicians to children at risk of severe outcomes when presenting with influenza-like illness during future pandemics.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important worldwide cause of death and disability for children. The Approaches and Decisions for Acute Pediatric TBI (ADAPT) Trial is an observational, cohort study to compare the effectiveness of six aspects of TBI care. Understanding the differences between clinical sites-including their structure, clinical processes, and culture differences-will be necessary to assess differences in outcome from the study and can inform the overall community regarding differences across academic centers.We developed a survey and queried ADAPT site principal investigators with a focus on six domains: (i) hospital, (ii) pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), (iii) medical staff characteristics, (iv) quality of care, (v) medication safety, and (vi) safety culture. Summary statistics were used to describe differences between centers.ADAPT clinical sites that enrolled a subject within the first year (32 US-based, 11 international) were studied. A wide variation in site characteristics was observed in hospital and ICU characteristics, including an almost sevenfold range in ICU size (8-55 beds) and more than fivefold range of overall ICU admissions (537-2623). Nursing staffing (predominantly 1:1 or 1:2) and the presence of pharmacists within the ICU (79 \%) were less variable, and most sites "strongly agreed" or "agreed" that Neurosurgery and Critical Care teams worked well together (81.4 \%). However, a minority of sites (46 \%) used an explicit protocol for treatment of children with severe TBI care.We found a variety of inter-center structure, process, and culture differences. These intrinsic differences between sites may begin to explain why interventional studies have failed to prove efficacy of experimental therapies. Understanding these differences may be an important factor in analyzing future ADAPT trial results and in determining best practices for pediatric severe TBI.},

	abstract = {The international scope of critical neurologic insults in children is unknown. Our objective was to assess the prevalence and outcomes of children admitted to PICUs with acute neurologic insults. Prospective study. Multicenter (n = 107 PICUs) and multinational (23 countries, 79% in North America and Europe). Children 7 days to 17 years old admitted to the ICU with new traumatic brain injury, stroke, cardiac arrest, CNS infection or inflammation, status epilepticus, spinal cord injury, hydrocephalus, or brain mass. None. We evaluated the prevalence and outcomes of children with predetermined acute neurologic insults. Child and center characteristics were recorded. Unfavorable outcome was defined as change in pre-post insult Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score greater than or equal to 2 or death at hospital discharge or 3 months, whichever came first. Screening data yielded overall prevalence of 16.2%. Of 924 children with acute neurologic insults, cardiac arrest (23%) and traumatic brain injury (19%) were the most common. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge was 12%. Cardiac arrest subjects had highest mortality (24%), and traumatic brain injury subjects had the most unfavorable outcomes (49%). The most common neurologic insult was infection/inflammation in South America, Asia, and the single African site but cardiac arrest in the remaining regions. Neurologic insults are a significant pediatric international health issue. They are frequent and contribute substantial morbidity and mortality. These data suggest a need for an increased focus on acute critical neurologic diseases in infants and children including additional research, enhanced availability of clinical resources, and the development of new therapies.},

	abstract = {Small series have suggested that outcomes after abusive head trauma are less favorable than after other injury mechanisms. We sought to determine the impact of abusive head trauma on mortality and identify factors that differentiate children with abusive head trauma from those with traumatic brain injury from other mechanisms. First 200 subjects from the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Trial-a comparative effectiveness study using an observational, cohort study design. PICUs in tertiary children's hospitals in United States and abroad. Consecutive children (age < 18 yr) with severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8; intracranial pressure monitoring). None. Demographics, injury-related scores, prehospital, and resuscitation events were analyzed. Children were dichotomized based on likelihood of abusive head trauma. A total of 190 children were included (n = 35 with abusive head trauma). Abusive head trauma subjects were younger (1.87 $\pm$ 0.32 vs 9.23 $\pm$ 0.39 yr; p < 0.001) and a greater proportion were female (54.3% vs 34.8%; p = 0.032). Abusive head trauma were more likely to 1) be transported from home (60.0% vs 33.5%; p < 0.001), 2) have apnea (34.3% vs 12.3%; p = 0.002), and 3) have seizures (28.6% vs 7.7%; p < 0.001) during prehospital care. Abusive head trauma had a higher prevalence of seizures during resuscitation (31.4 vs 9.7%; p = 0.002). After adjusting for covariates, there was no difference in mortality (abusive head trauma, 25.7% vs nonabusive head trauma, 18.7%; hazard ratio, 1.758; p = 0.60). A similar proportion died due to refractory intracranial hypertension in each group (abusive head trauma, 66.7% vs nonabusive head trauma, 69.0%). In this large, multicenter series, children with abusive head trauma had differences in prehospital and in-hospital secondary injuries which could have therapeutic implications. Unlike other traumatic brain injury populations in children, female predominance was seen in abusive head trauma in our cohort. Similar mortality rates and refractory intracranial pressure deaths suggest that children with severe abusive head trauma may benefit from therapies including invasive monitoring and adherence to evidence-based guidelines.},

	abstract = {Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is a mainstay of therapy for children with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its overall association with patient outcome is unclear. To test the hypothesis that ICP monitoring is associated with improved functional survival of children with severe TBI. A propensity-weighted effectiveness analysis was conducted using 2 linked national databases with data from 30 US children's hospitals from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2012, on 3084 children with severe TBI. Clinical events including neurosurgical procedures were identified using validated computable phenotypes. Data analysis was conducted from September 1, 2016, to March 1, 2017. Placement of an ICP monitor. A composite of hospital mortality, discharge to hospice, or survival with placement of new tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes. Of the 3084 children in the study (1128 girls and 1956 boys; mean [SD] age, 7.03 [5.44] years), 1002 (32.4%) underwent ICP monitoring, with substantial hospital variation (6% to 50% by hospital). Overall, 484 children (15.7%) experienced the primary composite outcome. A propensity approach using matching weights generated good covariate balance between those who did and those who did not undergo ICP monitoring. Using a propensity-weighted logistic regression model clustered by hospital, no statistically significant difference was found in functional survival between monitored and unmonitored patients (odds ratio of poor outcome among those who underwent ICP monitoring, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.99-1.74). In a prespecified secondary analysis, no difference in mortality was found (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.89-1.50). Prespecified subgroup analyses of children younger and older than 2 years of age and among those with unintentional and inflicted (intentional) injuries also showed no difference in outcome with ICP monitoring. With the use of linked national data and validated computable phenotypes, no evidence was found of a benefit from ICP monitoring on functional survival of children with severe TBI. Intracranial pressure monitoring is a widely but inconsistently used technology with incompletely demonstrated effectiveness. A large prospective cohort study or randomized trial is needed.},
